This application was heard in Sudbury on January 3, 2013. The Landlord’s agent, MS, and the Tenant, MM, attended the hearing. Determinations: 1. The Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period from December 1, 2012 to January 31, 2013. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination. 2. The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit. 3. The monthly rent is $861.00 effective January 1, 2013. 4. The Tenants have made no payment since the application was filed. 5. The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $840.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord. 6. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from November 9, 2011 to December 31, 2012. 7. The Tenants expect to be able to pay the arrears. The Landlord will consider delaying the eviction proceedings upon receipt of payments towards the arrears. 8. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. It is ordered that: 1. Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before January 19, 2013. 2. The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $196.60*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January 8, 2013, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit. 3.

If the unit is not vacated on or before January 19, 2013, then starting January 20, 2013, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced. 7. Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 20, 2013. 8. If, on or before January 19, 2013, the Tenants pay the amount of $1,871.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit.

This application was heard in Sudbury on January 3, 2013. The Landlord’s agent, MS, and the Tenant, MM, attended the hearing. Determinations: 1. The Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period from December 1, 2012 to January 31, 2013. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination. 2. The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit. 3. The monthly rent is $861.00 effective January 1, 2013. 4. The Tenants have made no payment since the application was filed. 5. The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $840.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord. 6. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from November 9, 2011 to December 31, 2012. 7. The Tenants expect to be able to pay the arrears. The Landlord will consider delaying the eviction proceedings upon receipt of payments towards the arrears. 8. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. It is ordered that: 1. Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before January 19, 2013. 2. The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $196.60*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January 8, 2013, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit. 3. The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $28.31 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 9, 2013 to the date they move out of the unit. 4. The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $170.00 for the cost of filing the application. 5.

This application was heard in Sudbury on January 3, 2013. The Landlord’s agent, MS, and the Tenant, MM, attended the hearing. Determinations: 1. The Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period from December 1, 2012 to January 31, 2013. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination. 2. The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit. 3. The monthly rent is $861.00 effective January 1, 2013. 4. The Tenants have made no payment since the application was filed. 5. The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $840.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord. 6. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from November 9, 2011 to December 31, 2012. 7. The Tenants expect to be able to pay the arrears. The Landlord will consider delaying the eviction proceedings upon receipt of payments towards the arrears. 8. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. It is ordered that: 1. Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before January 19, 2013. 2. The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $196.60*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January 8, 2013, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit. 3. The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $28.31 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 9, 2013 to the date they move out of the unit. 4. The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $170.00 for the cost of filing the application. 5.
