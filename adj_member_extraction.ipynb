       "\"File Numbers: CEL-73963-18-RV CEL-76175-18-SA Order under Section 21.2 of the Statutory Powers Procedure Act and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 Review and Motion Order IS (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict ZSP and BH (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe (L1 application). The Landlordâ€™s L1 application was resolved by order CEL-73963-18 issued on April 13, 2018. The Tenants requested a review of that order. On May 22, 2018 interim order CEL-73963-18-RV-IN was issued staying the order issued on April 13, 2018. The Landlord also filed an L4 application for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because they failed to meet a condition specified in prior order CEL-73963-18 issued on April 13, 2018. The Landlord's L4 application was resolved ex parte (without a hearing) by order CEL-76175-18, issued on May 24, 2018. The Tenants filed a motion to set aside or cancel that order. The Tenantsâ€™ review request and the Tenantsâ€™ motion were heard together in Mississauga on June 15, 2018. The Landlord and the Tenant, ZP, attended the hearing. The Landlordâ€™s husband, ZS, assisted the Landlord at the hearing. Determinations: The Tenantsâ€™ Review Request 1. There is a serious error in order CEL-73963-18 issued on April 13, 2018. The Member who heard that application assumed that the rent was due in full on the 22nd day of the month. 2. However, the monthly rent is paid bi-monthly on the 22nd and 8th of the month. A copy of the written tenancy agreement was presented at the hearing which confirms these payment dates. 3. The payment plan the Member ordered requires the Tenants to pay the full monthly rent in advance on the 22nd of each month instead of half on the 22nd and half on the 8th. This impacted on the Tenantsâ€™ ability to fully comply with the ordered payment plan. 4. Due to the serious error, the Tenantsâ€™ review request was granted at the review hearing and the Landlordâ€™s L1 application was re-heard. The Tenantsâ€™ Motion 5. The error in the original payment plan order led to the Tenantsâ€™ failure to fully comply with the ordered payments. Also, the amount of monthly rent claimed in the L4 application is incorrect for the reasons that are explained below. The ex parte eviction order issued on May 24, 2018 requires the Tenants to pay more rent than they lawfully owe. Therefore, the Tenantsâ€™ motion is granted and the order is cancelled and replaced with this order. 6. The Tenants made two payment after the April 13th order was issued. They paid the Landlord $2,050 on April 22, 2018 and $1,173.00 on May 4, 2018. No payments have been made since that time. This is not disputed. 7. After the Tenants filed their review the payment plan order was stayed or put on hold by the interim order that was issued and the Tenants did not make any more of the ordered payments because they expected the payment plan that had been ordered to be varied to reflect the correct dates the rent is due and payable. The Amount of the Lawful Rent 8. The lawful monthly rent is $1,990.00. 9. When the tenancy began in August 2015 the monthly rent was $1,990.00. 10. There is no dispute that the Landlord increased the rent by $60.00 to $2,050.00 and that there was no 90 day written notice of the rent increase as required by section 116 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the â€˜Actâ€™). 11. Subsection 116(4) of the Act states a rent increase is void if the Landlord has not given the required 90 day notice. 12. The rent increase of $60.00 which increased the rent to $2,050.00 is void. As a result of the void increase, the lawful monthly rent returns to the original amount of $1,990.00. This amount is due and payable bi-monthly with $995.00 due on the 22nd of the month and $995.00 due on the 8th of the month. 13. The Tenants have paid the $60.00 rent increase in four of the past months. This amounts to an overpayment of $240.00 ($60.00 x 4). This overpayment is credited to the amount of rent arrears owing. 14. The Landlord argued that the Tenants agreed to the rent increase. This is irrelevant. Section 3 of the Act makes it clear that the Act applies despite any agreement or waiver to the contrary. Section 4 states that any part of a tenancy agreement that conflicts with the Act is void. These sections ensure that parties cannot simply contract out of their rights and responsibilities under the Act. The Rent Arrears Owing 15. The Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period from January 22, 2018 to June 21, 2018. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a N4 Notice of Termination effective February 26, 2018. 16. All of the payments the Tenants have made are reflected and credited in the Landlordâ€™s rent ledger. 17. At the review hearing, the rent arrears owing were calculated based on the lawful rent of $1,990.00 and subtracting the credit for the overpaid rent as well as the other payments the Tenants have made. There is no dispute that the rent arrears owing to June 21, 2018 are $4,777.00. 18. The Tenants also owe the Landlord $190.00 for the fee to file the L1 rent arrears application. 19. The total amount owing to the Landlord up to June 21, 2018 is $4,967.00 ($4,777.00 + $190.00). An additional half month of rent at $995.00 comes due on June 22, 2018. Relief from Eviction 20. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. 21. The Tenants have resided in the rental unit since 2015. They have four children. The rent arrears accumulated because both Tenants lost time off work over the past year due to health issues. Both Tenants are back at work full time and now have sufficient income to cover the ongoing rent and the arrears payments. 22. The Landlord is concerned that the Tenants cannot afford the rent and utilities for the rental unit and believes she will not get the proposed payments. The prejudice to the Landlord is minimized because she can request to end the tenancy if the payments ordered below are not paid in full or on time. 23. The payments ordered below were discussed at the hearing. The Tenants were made aware of their obligation to begin the payments as of June 22nd even if they have not received this order in the mail by that date. It is ordered that: 1. The Tenantsâ€™ motion is granted. Order CEL-76175-18, issued on May 24, 2018, is cancelled and replaced by the following: 2. The Tenantsâ€™ review request is granted. Order CEL-73963-18, issued on April 13, 2018, is also cancelled and replaced by the following: 3. The Tenants shall pay the Landlord $4,777.00 which represents the amount of rent arrears owing up to June 21, 2018 4. The Tenants shall also pay the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application. 5. The Tenants shall pay the Landlord the full amount owing of $4,967.00, and the additional rent that comes due, as follows: a. On or before June 22, 2018 $995.00 (1st half of June 22 to July 21 rent) b. On or before July 4, 2018 $650.00 (arrears and filing fee) c. On or before July 8, 2018 $995.00 (2nd half of June 22 to July 21 rent) d. On or before July 22, 2018 $995.00 (1st half of July 22 to August 21 rent) e. On or before July 27, 2018 $650.00 (arrears) f. On or before August 8, 2018 $995.00 (2nd half of July 22 to August 21 rent) g. On or before August 22, 2018 $995.00 (1st half of August 22 to Sept. 21 rent) h. On or before August 31, 2018 $1,200.00 (arrears) i. On or before September 8, 2018 $995.00 (2nd half of August 22 to Sept. 21 rent) j. On or before September 22, 2018 $995.00 (1st half of Sept. 22 to Oct. 21 rent) k. On or before September 30, 2018 $2,467.00 (balance of arrears) l. On or before October 8, 2018 $995.00 (2nd half of Sept. 22 to Oct. 21 rent) 6. If the Tenants fail to make any one of the payments in paragraph 5 of this order, in full and on time, the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, without notice to the Tenants for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants. The Landlord must make this application no later than 30 days after the Tenantsâ€™ failure to make a payment. As part of the application, the Landlord can also request an order for rent that became owing after the date of this order and NSF cheque fees and related administration charges.
