      "mice in his unit so the Landlord or his spouse contacted a contractor and the\n",
      "Landlord told the Tenant the contractor would come in to address the issue\n",
      "within 48 hours. The Tenant wanted prompter action and told the Landlord that\n",
      "was unreasonable. According to the Tenant, the Landlord called him a “bitch”\n",
      "and a “little wife” and the Tenant went back downstairs for a nap.\n",
      "19. The Landlord does not specifically deny saying\n",
      "these things to the Tenant. He just says the Tenant was very arrogant and being\n",
      "unreasonable.\n",
      "20. A couple of hours later the Landlord’s spouse\n",
      "texted the Tenant to say the contractor would be there in 10 minutes. According\n",
      "to the Tenant, the contractor then barged into his unit. The Tenant told the\n",
      "contractor he had not received proper notice of entry, this was a bad time, and\n",
      "asked him to leave. When the contractor expressed reluctance, the Tenant called\n",
      "911 and the contractor left immediately. That was about 7 p.m. on February 17,\n",
      "2018.\n",
      "21. Section 25 of the Act says a landlord can only\n",
      "enter a rental unit in accordance with the Act. Section 26 details examples of\n",
      "when notice is not required. In this situation none of the provisions of s. 26\n",

      "unit at the time of entry. As notice of entry was not served in accordance with\n",
      "s. 27 of the Act, the entry was not in compliance with the Act. As the Landlord\n",
      "is responsible for the acts of his contractors and agents, this means I am\n",
      "satisfied that on February 17, 2018 the Landlord breached s. 25 of the Act.\n",

      "paint the room, and replace the door and lock.\n",

      "the Tenant moved out prior to the disintegration of the relationship. At that\n",

      "the Landlord started serving notices of termination in March, the Tenant filed\n",
      "this application with the Board on March 23, 2018. He subsequently filed and\n",
      "served a request to amend the application on April 25, 2018. As the Landlord\n",
      "was properly served I granted the Tenant’s request to amend his application.\n",
      "52. What appears to have happened after the police\n",
      "became involved and notices of termination served is that the parties’\n",
      "relationship and behaviour deteriorated further.\n",
      "53. The Tenant says that on March 28, 2018, the Landlord\n",
      "turned on the music in his part of the residential complex, turned it up very\n",
      "loud, and went out. The Landlord says this was not true; he was home, it did\n",
      "not happen.\n",
      "54. As the Tenant bears the burden of proof with\n",
      "respect to this allegation and the evidence of the parties is essentially equal\n",
      "but opposite I find that the Tenant has led insufficient evidence to establish\n",
      "the Landlord harassed him on March 28, 2018 by playing music loudly and leaving\n",
      "it on while he went out.\n",
      "55. The Tenant says the Landlord did this a second\n",
      "time on March 29, 2018. So the Tenant turned off the electricity to stop the\n",
      "noise. That caused a malfunction in an alarm in the basement triggering an\n",
      "annoying intermittent beeping. When the beeping did not stop the Tenant told\n",
      "the Landlord he could not live like that. The Tenant says the Landlord told him\n",
      "it was his own fault and flipped him the middle finger.\n",
      "56. The Landlord acknowledges the Tenant turned off\n",

      "Tenant’s evidence that the Landlord told him it was his fault nor does the\n",
      "Landlord deny flipping him the middle finger.\n",
      "57. There can be no excuse for a landlord “flipping\n",
      "the finger” at a tenant. Any reasonable landlord knows or ought to know that\n",
      "such behaviour is unprofessional and would be unwelcome to any reasonable\n",
      "tenant. So I am satisfied that in doing so the Landlord breached s. 23 of the\n",
      "Act.\n",
      "58. Because of the beeping the Tenant rented\n",
      "alternative accommodation and stayed there from March 29, 2018 to April 22,\n",
      "2018. He paid $685.00 for that alternative accommodation.\n",
      "59. Although I would agree with the Landlord that\n",
      "the Tenant is partially responsible for the annoying beeping because he turned\n",
      "off the electricity, I am satisfied that the Tenant did so because of the\n",
      "Landlord’s behaviour in playing loud music. That being said, the reasonable\n",
      "thing the Tenant should have done, but did not, was ask the Landlord to turn\n",
      "the music down.\n",
      "60. Given all of the above, I do not believe the\n",
      "Landlord can be held financially responsible for the disturbance caused by the\n",
      "beeping. The Tenant is not entitled to an order for $685.00 for the place he\n",
      "stayed in from March 29, 2018 to April 22, 2018.\n",
      "61. During this period the Tenant went back and\n",
      "forth to the rental unit.\n",
      "62. He says that on April 3, 2018 he noticed $150.00\n",
      "was missing from his coffee table indicating someone was in his unit. The Landlord\n",
      "says “why would I take the Tenant’s money?” which I took to mean the Landlord\n",
      "denies entering the rental unit or stealing money from the Tenant.\n",
      "63. The evidence with respect to this money and the\n",
      "alleged illegal entry is simply insufficient to meet the Tenant’s burden of\n",
      "proof. He may have had money go missing; but he may not have. So that part of\n",
      "the Tenant’s application must also be dismissed.\n",

      "repaired.\n",
      "THE CHANGING\n",
      "OF THE LOCKS\n",
      "65. On April 21, 2018 the Tenant discovered the key\n",
      "pad code to the front door had been changed but he was able to get into the\n",
      "residential complex because the cleaner was there. The Tenant says when he\n",
      "asked the Landlord for the new code, the Landlord refused so the Tenant\n",
      "threatened to turn the power off again. The Tenant says the Landlord was in his\n",
      "face yelling at that point so the Tenant called 911 again.\n",
      "66. The Landlord confirms he refused to give the\n",
      "Tenant the new code because the Tenant had not paid rent for the month of\n",
      "April, 2018.\n",
      "67. Section 24 of the Act says:\n",
      "A landlord\n",
      "shall not alter the locking system on a door giving entry to a rental unit or\n",
      "residential complex or cause the locking system to be altered during the\n",
      "tenant’s occupancy of the rental unit without giving the tenant replacement\n",
      "keys.\n",
      "68. By changing the key pad code and refusing to\n",
      "give him the new one the Landlord breached s. 24 of the Act. Remedy with\n",
      "respect to this breach is discussed below.\n",
      "69. According to the Tenant, when the police arrived\n",
      "they told him that nothing was in writing so he had to leave. The Tenant was\n",
      "given four hours to remove all of his possessions which was not sufficient\n",
      "time. He also says the Landlord refused to let him access his stored\n",
      "possessions in the garage.\n",
      "70. The Landlord confirms the police gave the Tenant\n",
      "four hours to remove his possessions but says the Landlord offered him more\n",
      "time. According to the Landlord the Tenant returned on April 30, 2018 to remove\n",
      "more of his possessions but the stuff left in the unit downstairs after that was\n",
      "garbage. So the Landlord put it out in bags and the Tenant did not come to\n",
      "retrieve it. However, the Landlord admits that he told the Tenant he would not\n",
      "let the Tenant access possessions in the garage unless the Tenant cleaned out\n",
      "the rental unit first.\n",
      "71. I would note at this point that the police had\n",
      "no right to tell the Tenant he had four hours to collect his possessions and\n",
      "leave. Subsection 168(2) of the Act says:\n",
      "The Board has\n",
      "exclusive jurisdiction to determine all applications under this Act and with\n",
      "respect to all matters in which jurisdiction is conferred on it by this Act.\n",

      "A tenancy may\n",
      "be terminated only in accordance with this Act.\n",
      "73. This means that only the Board had the authority\n",
      "to tell the Tenant when and if he had to move out.\n",
      "74. At that point in time the Landlord had filed an\n",
      "application with the Board for eviction but that application had not been\n",
      "heard. Even if the Landlord had obtained an eviction order, the Board’s orders\n",
      "cannot be enforced by a landlord or by the police; they are enforceable only\n",
      "through the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) as they are the legal equivalent\n",
      "of writs of possession. The Sheriff gives tenants notice as to when they are\n",
      "coming and a tenant has 72 hours after a legal eviction to recover his or her\n",
      "possessions.\n",
      "75. Further, the Tenant here had clearly not\n",
      "abandoned the unit. His possessions were there. He was returning to the unit on\n",
      "a regular basis.\n",
      "76. So what happened to the Tenant on April 21, 2018\n",
      "was also an illegal eviction. By putting the Tenant out of possession, clearing\n",
      "out the unit of the Tenant’s remaining items, and refusing the Tenant’s request\n",
      "to recover his possessions in the garage, the Landlord breached sections 22 and\n",
      "23 of the Act. Again, remedy is discussed further below.\n",
      "77. On May 3, 2018 the Landlord put the Tenant’s\n",
      "remaining possessions out on the curb and sent the Tenant a text showing the\n",
      "Tenant the bags sitting outside.\n",
      "78. The Tenant says he found a new place to live and\n",
      "was able to get possession of his new rental unit on April 22, 2018.\n",
      "REMEDIES FOR\n",
      "THE LANDLORD’S BREACHES\n",
      "79. The Tenant’s application seeks: abatement of the\n",
      "rent; a cease and desist order; compensation for out of pocket expenses; an\n",
      "administrative fine; and termination of the tenancy.\n",
      "80. The request for a cease and desist order is with\n",
      "respect to the illegal entry and is no longer relevant as the Tenant no longer\n",
      "lives in the rental unit.\n",
      "81. However, the amended application also seeks an\n",
      "order requiring the Landlord to return to the Tenant any of his possessions still\n",
      "in the garage. The Tenant is entitled to such an order.\n",
      "82. The request for compensation for out of pocket\n",
      "expenses is for rat poison, traps and door “scrapes”. No evidence was led in\n",
      "support of these claims but even if it had been they would have been denied. As\n",
      "I stated at the hearing, this application is not based on the rights and\n",
      "obligations set out in s. 20(1) of the Act. The breaches by the Landlord of the\n",
      "Act as set out above, are not connected to these claims so they are denied\n",
      "accordingly.\n",
      "83. In the amended application the Tenant seeks\n",
      "$500.00 for moving costs plus the cost of staying elsewhere for the period\n",
      "March 29, 2018 and April 22, 2018. No evidence was led that the Tenant incurred\n",
      "moving expenses and for the reasons already stated above, the Tenant is not\n",
      "entitled to a remedy for the cost of staying elsewhere due to the beeping.\n",
      "84. As stated above, the tenancy shall be terminated\n",
      "effective April 21, 2018. The Landlord’s behaviour in changing the locks and\n",
      "illegally evicting the Tenant justifies such an order.\n",
      "85. That leaves the claims for abatement and an\n",
      "administrative fine.\n",
      "86. Abatement of the rent is a contractual remedy\n",
      "entitled to reflect the idea that the Tenant is paying for a bundle of goods\n",
      "and services and if the Tenant is not receiving those goods and services the\n",
      "rent should be abated proportional to the difference between what is being paid\n",
      "for and what is being received.\n",
      "87. The Tenant here is clearly entitled to abatement\n",
      "of the rent.\n",
      "88. With respect to the illegal entry by the\n",
      "Landlord’s contractor on February 17, 2018, although the entry was illegal and\n",
      "the Tenant was entitled to notice of a specific date and time at least 24 hours\n",
      "in advance, one of the reasons the Tenant did not receive proper notice is\n",
      "because he insisted the mice problem be addressed quickly. The 48 hours’ notice\n",
      "he was given was not quick enough. So it seems to me to be somewhat\n",
      "unreasonable to award the Tenant any significant abatement for the entry as the\n",
      "Landlord was simply trying to acquiesce to the Tenant’s demands. As a result,\n",
      "only a minimal abatement is warranted which I fix at $50.00.\n",
      "89. With respect to the name calling on February 17,\n",
      "2018, and the Landlord flipping the Tenant the finger on March 29, 2018,\n",
      "abatement of the rent is justified. The Tenant led little evidence as to how\n",
      "these events impacted him but he does say he felt belittled and depressed.\n",
      "Given all of the evidence before me and my knowledge of similar like cases\n",
      "before the Board, it seems to me that a reasonable abatement of the rent for\n",
      "these two breaches would be $200.00 each for a total of $400.00.\n",
      "90. With respect to the changing of the locks, the\n",
      "disposal of the Tenant’s possessions, the refusal to let the Tenant access the\n",
      "garage, and the illegal eviction, I believe a reasonable abatement of the rent\n",
      "would be two month’s rent or $1,600.00. I say this based on similar like cases\n",
      "before the Board and because even though the Tenant found another place to live\n",
      "the day following the illegal eviction, the sequence of events described above\n",
      "was clearly distressing to the Tenant.\n",
      "91. The final request in the amended application is\n",
      "for an administrative fine.\n",
      "92. With respect to the request for an\n",
      "administrative fine the Board’s Interpretation Guideline # 16 on Administrative\n",
      "Fines says:\n",
      "An\n",
      "administrative fine is a remedy to be used by the Board to encourage compliance\n",
      "with the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “RTA”), and to deter\n",
      "landlords from engaging in similar activity in the future. This remedy is not\n",
      "normally imposed unless a landlord has shown a blatant disregard for the RTA\n",
      "and other remedies will not provide adequate deterrence and compliance.\n",
      "93. The Landlord here has clearly shown a blatant\n",
      "disregard for the Act. Changing the locks, illegal evicting the Tenant, and\n",
      "refusing to give him access to his possessions all demonstrate an utter\n",
      "disregard for the Tenant’s rights and the law.\n",
      "94. In terms of quantum for the fine, the remedies\n",
      "granted above to the Tenant are relatively minor. Further, the nature of the\n",
      "behaviour in question is such that a substantial fine is warranted. Given all\n",
      "of the above, and my knowledge of similar like circumstances I am satisfied an\n",
