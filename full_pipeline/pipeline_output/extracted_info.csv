            Order
under Sections 69 and 77
 
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-04435-18
TNL-03907-18



 


 


 



 
VK
and EK (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict (’AM’) and (‘AV’) (together, the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe (‘L1 application’).
 
The
Landlords also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenants because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they
permitted in the residential complex have substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlords or
another tenant (‘L2 application’).
 
The
Landlords also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenants because the Tenants entered into an agreement to terminate the tenancy (‘L3
application’).
 
This
combined application was heard in Newmarket on May 30, 2018.
 
The Landlords and the Tenant, (‘AM’), assisted by duty counsel, GO,
attended the hearing.
 
 
Preliminary Issue – adjournment request denied 
 
1.   
The Tenant, AM, initially attended on his own and requested an
adjournment because the second named Tenant was at work and therefore was not
present.
 
2.   
No notice had been given to the Board or to the Landlords that an
adjournment would be requested, and no reason was given why AV could not
arrange to be present or why AM could not speak for and represent AV, who is
his girlfriend.
 
3.   
The conduct alleged in the application is serious and ongoing. 
The Tenant, AV did not act reasonably in not attending the hearing and in not
sending someone to represent her, and it was unfair to the Landlord to adjourn
the hearing.  I declined the request for an adjournment.
 
4.   
The hearing was held down until later in the day at which time the
Tenant, AM attended with the assistance of duty counsel.
Determinations:
 
L1 application
 
5.      The
Tenants do not dispute that they have not paid the total rent they were
required to pay for the period from February 15, 2018 to June 14, 2018. 
Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective
April 7, 2018.
 
6.      The
Landlords collected a rent deposit of $1,200.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlords.
 
7.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from November 13,
2017 to April 7, 2018.
L2
application
8.      The
Tenants do not dispute the allegations made by the Landlords.  The uncontested
testimony of the Landlords establishes that the Tenants have engaged in loud
shouting and throwing of items and arguing late at night, and that this disruptive
conduct has substantially interfered with the Landlords' and the other tenants'
reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex.  The Tenants did not correct
the problem within the time period set out in the Notice of Termination.
L3
application
9.      The
alleged agreement relied upon by the Landlords is signed by the Tenant, AM
only.  It is not signed by the second named Tenant and there is no evidence
that it was signed on her behalf or with her authority.  The agreement is not
enforceable against the Tenant, AV.
Section
83
10.   The
Tenants do not oppose the termination of the tenancy, but ask that eviction be
postponed until June 30, 2018.  They agree that the postponement should be
conditional upon (a) their payment of $1,000.00 toward the arrears on or before
Friday, June 8, 2018; and no further substantial interference with the
reasonable enjoyment of other tenants taking place, and that, in the event of a
breach of either of those conditions, the Landlord should be entitled to
immediately apply to the Board pursuant to section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants for immediate
termination of the tenancy.  
11.   The
Landlords oppose any delay in the eviction because of the serious and
persistent pattern of disruptive conduct by the Tenants.
12.   The
delay requested by the Tenants is only 15 days beyond the date on which the
eviction would take place under the Board’s standard 11 day eviction order, and
will allow the Tenants some additional time to find new accommodation and move
out. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it would not be unfair to postpone
the eviction until June 30, 2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act, subject
to the conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and
204(1) of the Act.  
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
tenancy may continue until June 30, 2018 on the condition that the Tenants:
 
(a)  pay to
the Landlords $1,000.00 on or before June 8, 2018; and 
 
(b)  do not
engage in any conduct that substantially interferes with the reasonable
enjoyment of the residential complex by the Landlords or by other tenants.
 
2.      If
the Tenants fail to comply with either of the conditions set out in paragraph 1
above, the Landlords may, without further notice to the Tenants, apply within
30 days to the Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order
terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants.
3.      The
tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants
must move out of the rental unit on or before June 30, 2018.
4.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $2,826.25*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to June 4, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
5.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $39.45 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting June 5, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
6.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
7.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before June
15, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from June 16, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
8.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before June 30, 2018, then starting July 1, 2018,
the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after July 1, 2018.

Preliminary Issue – adjournment request denied  1. The Tenant, AM, initially attended on his own and requested an adjournment because the second named Tenant was at work and therefore was not present.  2. No notice had been given to the Board or to the Landlords that an adjournment would be requested, and no reason was given why AV could not arrange to be present or why AM could not speak for and represent AV, who is his girlfriend.  3. The conduct alleged in the application is serious and ongoing. The Tenant, AV did not act reasonably in not attending the hearing and in not sending someone to represent her, and it was unfair to the Landlord to adjourn the hearing. I declined the request for an adjournment.  4. The hearing was held down until later in the day at which time the Tenant, AM attended with the assistance of duty counsel. Determinations:  L1 application  5. The Tenants do not dispute that they have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period from February 15, 2018 to June 14, 2018. Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective April 7, 2018.  6. The Landlords collected a rent deposit of $1,200.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlords.  7. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from November 13, 2017 to April 7, 2018. L2 application 8. The Tenants do not dispute the allegations made by the Landlords. The uncontested testimony of the Landlords establishes that the Tenants have engaged in loud shouting and throwing of items and arguing late at night, and that this disruptive conduct has substantially interfered with the Landlords' and the other tenants' reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex. The Tenants did not correct the problem within the time period set out in the Notice of Termination. L3 application 9. The alleged agreement relied upon by the Landlords is signed by the Tenant, AM only. It is not signed by the second named Tenant and there is no evidence that it was signed on her behalf or with her authority. The agreement is not enforceable against the Tenant, AV. Section 83 10. The Tenants do not oppose the termination of the tenancy, but ask that eviction be postponed until June 30, 2018. They agree that the postponement should be conditional upon (a) their payment of $1,000.00 toward the arrears on or before Friday, June 8, 2018; and no further substantial interference with the reasonable enjoyment of other tenants taking place, and that, in the event of a breach of either of those conditions, the Landlord should be entitled to immediately apply to the Board pursuant to section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants for immediate termination of the tenancy. 11. The Landlords oppose any delay in the eviction because of the serious and persistent pattern of disruptive conduct by the Tenants. 12. The delay requested by the Tenants is only 15 days beyond the date on which the eviction would take place under the Board’s standard 11 day eviction order, and will allow the Tenants some additional time to find new accommodation and move out. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until June 30, 2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act, subject to the conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. It is ordered that:  1. The tenancy may continue until June 30, 2018 on the condition that the Tenants:  (a) pay to the Landlords $1,000.00 on or before June 8, 2018; and  (b) do not engage in any conduct that substantially interferes with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex by the Landlords or by other tenants.  2. If the Tenants fail to comply with either of the conditions set out in paragraph 1 above, the Landlords may, without further notice to the Tenants, apply within 30 days to the Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants. 3. The tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before June 30, 2018. 4. The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $2,826.25*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to June 4, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit. 5. The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $39.45 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting June 5, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit. 6. The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the application. 7. If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before June 15, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from June 16, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding. 8. If the unit is not vacated on or before June 30, 2018, then starting July 1, 2018, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced. 9. Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after July 1, 2018.

Order under Section 21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-07666-19-RV
 










 
 

Review Order
 
M
D and B K (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict O G and K D (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe. (L1 Application)
 
The
Landlords also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenants because the Landlords require possession of the rental unit for the
purpose of residential occupation; and because the Tenants have been
persistently late in paying their rent. The Landlords also claimed compensation
for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date. (L2
Application)
 
This
L1/L2 Application was resolved by order TSL-07666-19 issued on August 30, 2019.
 
On September 3, 2019, the Tenants requested a review of the order
and that the order be stayed until the request to review the order is resolved.

 
On September 4, 2019, interim order TSL-07666-19-IN was issued,
staying the order issued on August 30, 2019.
 
The request was heard in Toronto on November 1, 2019.
 
The Landlords; the Landlords’ legal representative, M P; and the
Tenants attended the hearing.
 
 
 
 
Determinations:
 
Request
to review granted
1.      At
the hearing, the Landlords consented to the Tenants’ request to review. I
proceeded to hear the application de novo. 
Merits
hearing 
L1
Application: Tenants owe the Landlords $3,854.79
2.      At
the hearing, the Tenants did not dispute the amount the Landlords claim they
owe. They acknowledge that they owe the Landlords approximately two months’
rent. One month represents the Tenants’ failure to pay rent in May 2019 because
they expected the Landlords to apply their last month’s rent deposit to that
month, improperly so. The other month represents the rent for November 2019,
which was due on the day of the review hearing but had not been paid as of the
hearing.  
3.      Based
on the evidence before me, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that as
of the review hearing, the Tenants owed the Landlords $3,854.79, including
arrears of rent to November 30, 2019 and the application filing fee. If the
Tenants have since made any payments to the Landlords, including for November’s
rent, those amounts should be deducted from the amount owing in this order.
L2
Application: Persistent late payments and Landlords’ own use
4.      The
parties do not dispute that the Tenants paid their rent late for eight of the
13 months between May 2018 and May 2019 as claimed in the N8 Notice of
Termination. Therefore, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the
Tenants have persistently paid their rent late.
5.      I
am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Landlords genuinely intend
to occupy the rental unit for residential purposes for a period of at least one
year. 
6.      The
Landlords testified that they recently sold their home in Mississauga and they
intend to move into the rental unit so they can be closer to the hospital where
the female Landlord has regular appointments and treatments and so they can
downsize in preparation for the male Landlord’s retirement. 
7.      The
Tenants testified that they do not believe that the Landlords genuinely intend
to move into the rental unit because the Landlords have repeatedly threatened
to evict the Tenants in connection with various behaviour, including after the
Landlords discovered that the Tenants were growing marijuana plants in the
rental unit. The Landlords denied that they served the N12 Notice of
Termination for any ulterior motive, including in response to the Tenants’
marijuana plants. The only evidence the Tenants produced to corroborate their
position is a text message from the male Landlord from March 30, 2019, stating
that if the Tenants denied the Landlords’ access to the rental unit to repair a
faucet there would be an eviction notice. However, I do not find that this is
sufficient evidence of an ulterior motive, especially compared to the evidence
the Landlords submitted in support of their position that they are intending to
move into the unit. 
8.      The
Landlords submitted the agreement of purchase and sale for their previous home.
The Landlords also submitted booking confirmations for Airbnb units that they
have been living in since the sale of their home closed. Together this evidence
supports the Landlords’ testimony that they were intending to move into the
rental unit after they sold their previous home, they are still waiting for
this to happen and they are prepared to move into the rental unit as soon as it
becomes vacant. The Landlords also submitted a letter from the female
Landlord’s doctor confirming that the female Landlord receives weekly
treatments at the Princess Margaret Hospital, which is closer to the rental
unit than it was to the Landlords’ previous home. 
9.      The
parties do not dispute that the Landlords paid the one month’s compensation
required by sections 48.1 and 55.1 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
“Act”) by waiving the Tenants’ rent for April 2019.
Section
83 considerations 
10.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
11.   The
Tenants have had considerable time to find another place to live since they
received the notices of termination months ago. The Tenants’ have a combined
household income of over $5,000.00, which is not insignificant. Although the
Tenants testified that they have had a difficult time finding another affordable
place to move into, they did not bring proof of the results of their housing
search in support of this claim. 
12.   The
Tenants raised a maintenance issue in the rental unit – a portion of the
ceiling which is discoloured. The Tenants did not submit evidence to establish
that this is a serious breach of the Landlords’ responsibilities under the Act
to merit mandatory refusal of eviction under subsection 83(3) of the Act. On
the other hand, the Landlords submitted an inspection report for the unit that
was prepared in May 2019, which indicates that the discolouration is a stain
that can be removed with a foot powder spray.
13.   Ultimately,
I find there is no reason to delay eviction any further. 
14.   Since
the arrears have changed since the original order was issued, I find it
appropriate to replace that order with an updated calculation of the amount
owing. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
request to review order TSL-07666-19 issued on August 30, 2019 is granted. 
2.      Order
TSL-07666-19 issued on August 30, 2019 is replaced with the following terms. 
3.      The
tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants is terminated, as of December 1,
2019. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before December 1,
2019.
4.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $1,238.53*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to November 20, 2019, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
5.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $60.24 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting November 21, 2019 to the date the Tenants move out of
the unit.
6.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
7.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before
December 1, 2019, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from December 2, 2019 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
8.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before December 1, 2019, then starting December
2, 2019, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after December 2,
2019.

(L1 Application) The Landlords also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants because the Landlords require possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation; and because the Tenants have been persistently late in paying their rent. The Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date. (L2 Application) This L1/L2 Application was resolved by order TSL-07666-19 issued on August 30, 2019. On September 3, 2019, the Tenants requested a review of the order and that the order be stayed until the request to review the order is resolved. On September 4, 2019, interim order TSL-07666-19-IN was issued, staying the order issued on August 30, 2019. The request was heard in Toronto on November 1, 2019. The Landlords; the Landlords’ legal representative, M P; and the Tenants attended the hearing. Determinations: Request to review granted 1.  At the hearing, the Landlords consented to the Tenants’ request to review. I proceeded to hear the application de novo. Merits hearing L1 Application: Tenants owe the Landlords $3,854.79 2.  At the hearing, the Tenants did not dispute the amount the Landlords claim they owe. They acknowledge that they owe the Landlords approximately two months’ rent. One month represents the Tenants’ failure to pay rent in May 2019 because they expected the Landlords to apply their last month’s rent deposit to that month, improperly so. The other month represents the rent for November 2019, which was due on the day of the review hearing but had not been paid as of the hearing. 3.  Based on the evidence before me, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that as of the review hearing, the Tenants owed the Landlords $3,854.79, including arrears of rent to November 30, 2019 and the application filing fee. If the Tenants have since made any payments to the Landlords, including for November’s rent, those amounts should be deducted from the amount owing in this order. L2 Application: Persistent late payments and Landlords’ own use 4.  The parties do not dispute that the Tenants paid their rent late for eight of the 13 months between May 2018 and May 2019 as claimed in the N8 Notice of Termination. Therefore, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Tenants have persistently paid their rent late. 5.  I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Landlords genuinely intend to occupy the rental unit for residential purposes for a period of at least one year. 6.  The Landlords testified that they recently sold their home in Mississauga and they intend to move into the rental unit so they can be closer to the hospital where the female Landlord has regular appointments and treatments and so they can downsize in preparation for the male Landlord’s retirement. 7.  The Tenants testified that they do not believe that the Landlords genuinely intend to move into the rental unit because the Landlords have repeatedly threatened to evict the Tenants in connection with various behaviour, including after the Landlords discovered that the Tenants were growing marijuana plants in the rental unit. The Landlords denied that they served the N12 Notice of Termination for any ulterior motive, including in response to the Tenants’ marijuana plants. The only evidence the Tenants produced to corroborate their position is a text message from the male Landlord from March 30, 2019, stating that if the Tenants denied the Landlords’ access to the rental unit to repair a faucet there would be an eviction notice. However, I do not find that this is sufficient evidence of an ulterior motive, especially compared to the evidence the Landlords submitted in support of their position that they are intending to move into the unit. 8.  The Landlords submitted the agreement of purchase and sale for their previous home. The Landlords also submitted booking confirmations for Airbnb units that they have been living in since the sale of their home closed. Together this evidence supports the Landlords’ testimony that they were intending to move into the rental unit after they sold their previous home, they are still waiting for this to happen and they are prepared to move into the rental unit as soon as it becomes vacant. The Landlords also submitted a letter from the female Landlord’s doctor confirming that the female Landlord receives weekly treatments at the Princess Margaret Hospital, which is closer to the rental unit than it was to the Landlords’ previous home. 9.  The parties do not dispute that the Landlords paid the one month’s compensation required by sections 48.1 and 55.1 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”) by waiving the Tenants’ rent for April 2019. Section 83 considerations 10. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. 11. The Tenants have had considerable time to find another place to live since they received the notices of termination months ago. The Tenants’ have a combined household income of over $5,000.00, which is not insignificant. Although the Tenants testified that they have had a difficult time finding another affordable place to move into, they did not bring proof of the results of their housing search in support of this claim. 12. The Tenants raised a maintenance issue in the rental unit – a portion of the ceiling which is discoloured. The Tenants did not submit evidence to establish that this is a serious breach of the Landlords’ responsibilities under the Act to merit mandatory refusal of eviction under subsection 83(3) of the Act. On the other hand, the Landlords submitted an inspection report for the unit that was prepared in May 2019, which indicates that the discolouration is a stain that can be removed with a foot powder spray. 13. Ultimately, I find there is no reason to delay eviction any further. 14. Since the arrears have changed since the original order was issued, I find it appropriate to replace that order with an updated calculation of the amount owing. It is ordered that: 1.  The request to review order TSL-07666-19 issued on August 30, 2019 is granted. 2.  Order TSL-07666-19 issued on August 30, 2019 is replaced with the following terms. 3.  The tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants is terminated, as of December 1, 2019. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before December 1, 2019. 4.  The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $1,238.53*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to November 20, 2019, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit. 5.  The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $60.24 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting November 21, 2019 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit. 6.  The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the application. 7.  If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before December 1, 2019, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from December 2, 2019 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding. 8.  If the unit is not vacated on or before December 1, 2019, then starting December 2, 2019, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced. 9.  Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after December 2, 2019.

Ontario Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for
an order to terminate the tenancy and evict KM (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (the ‘L1 Application’).
 
The Tenant applied for an order determining
that the Landlord, the Landlord’s superintendent or
the Landlord’s agent withheld or deliberately interfered with the reasonable
supply of a vital service, care service, or food that the Landlord is obligated
to supply under the tenancy agreement (the ‘T2 Application’).
 
The Tenant also applied
for an order determining that the Landlord failed to meet the Landlord’s
maintenance obligations under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') or failed to comply with health, safety, housing or maintenance
standards (the ‘T6 Application’). 
 
These applications were heard in [CITY] on
May 23, 2018.  The Landlord’s Agent, AA, the Tenant,
the Tenant’s Agent, GL, and the witness, BB, attended the hearing.
 
Preliminary Issues:
 
1.     The Tenant’s applications are amended to remove
A.A. as a party.
2.     The submitted tenancy agreement indicates that
the Landlord is a second mortgagee.  The first mortgagee, P.B., was not served
with Notice of the Hearing.  However, as A.A. advised that her corporation had
purchased the entirety of P.B.’s interest in the rental unit, I find no
prejudice to P.B. in proceeding with the hearing in his absence.  
Determinations and
Reasons:
The L1 Application
 
3.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent she was
required to pay for the period from February 1, 2018 to May 31, 2018.  Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective February
17, 2018.
4.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
5.     The monthly rent is $1,050.00.
6.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit of
$1,050.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
7.     Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenant for the period from July 22, 2017 to February 17, 2018.
8.     The parties agree that the amount outstanding to
May 31, 2018, inclusive of rent arrears ($4,200.00) and costs ($175.00), is
$4,375.00.  At the hearing, the Tenant agreed that she was four months in
arrears.  While she acknowledged that she wilfully withheld the rent in
retaliation for the outstanding maintenance issues, she also testified that
P.B. had attended at the rental unit and instructed her to pay the rent only to
him, rather than A.A. in response to a financial conflict between the two
mortgagees.  It is unclear if P.B.’s interference was a substantial factor in
the Tenant’s failure to pay the arrears as she did not pay him any portion of
the outstanding balance either.
9.     The Tenant supports three children on a rather
limited income and has so far been unable to find alternate housing in her
price range.  She requested that the eviction be postponed until the end of
June, 2018 to allow her children to complete their school year.  On the balance
of probabilities, I find that the Tenant will reasonably require additional
time to either void the order for eviction or secure new accommodations.
10.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act and find that it would not be
unfair to postpone the eviction until June 30, 2018, pursuant to subsection
83(1)(b) of the Act.
The T2 Application 
11.  According to the Tenant’s description of this issue in the
T2 Application and the evidence submitted at the hearing, the problem related
to a maintenance issue with the hot water heater rather than a situation in
which the Landlord or its agent withheld hot water from the Tenant or wilfully
interfered with its supply.
12.  As a result, I find that the Tenant should have included
this issue under the T6 Application rather than under the present T2
Application.  As the Act provides different remedies with regard to a
maintenance application compared to a T2 Application, the forms are not
interchangeable.
13.  Since the Landlord received notice that the Tenant intended
to raise this issue at the hearing, the matter of the hot water heater has been
addressed below under the proper T6 Application.
14.  Therefore, I do not find that the Landlord, the Landlord's
superintendent or the Landlord's agent withheld
a reasonable supply of a vital service, care service, or food that the Landlord
was obligated to supply under the tenancy agreement or deliberately interfered
with the reasonable supply of vital service, care service, or food.
The T6 Application – Water Leaks and the Kitchen Sink 
15.  The Tenant testified that she discovered that the kitchen
sink was leaking when she moved into the rental unit on July 21, 2017.  The
sink is located on a kitchen island with cabinets.  She notified the Landlord
of these issues on August 20, 2017 and around the same time, she also
discovered a maggot infestation that appeared to originate from under the
kitchen island.  On or about September 14, 2017, A.A.’s husband, O.A., attended
at the rental unit to investigate and conduct repairs.  She stated that he
removed the sink and cupboards, but promised to return the next day to complete
the work.  However, this did not occur.  Removal of the sink did not resolve
the underlying leak issue.
16.  At the hearing, she submitted photographs of the flooring
that had been under the moved kitchen island, showing a considerable amount of
food and other debris accumulated in this area.  Other images show several
maggots moving along what appears to be a baseboard or some other surface in
the rental unit.  She recalled that these photographs were taken at some point
in September, 2017.  She testified that in October, 2017, she discovered the
remains of a one kilogram bag of dog food under the baseboards under the
island.  This and other garbage wedged into the flooring apparently provided a
food source for the maggots. 
17.  She testified that O.A. did not return for five months and
the issue was only resolved when she replaced the cabinetry at her own expense.
 She submitted a receipt from B.B., her own contractor.  This document
indicated that he installed kitchen cabinets, a new countertop, sink and faucet
and completed all associated electrical plumbing and electrical work.  He also
installed a new dishwasher.  The total that B.B. charged for this work was
$600.00.  The receipt indicated that the Tenant had paid $125.00 of this amount
as of February 22, 2018, leaving a balance of $475.00 outstanding.  The Tenant
testified that she ultimately paid the full balance as A.A. refused to pay on
the grounds that she had not authorized the work.
18.  B.B. has known the Tenant for approximately twenty years. 
He has approximately twelve years’ experience in carpentry and related trades. 
He testified that A.A. sent him to pick up a new kitchen cabinet at Habitat for
Humanity (‘Habitat’) for the rental unit at some point in February, 2018 and advised
him that she had a credit with that agency.  When he attended at Habitat, he
discovered that no such credit was on file.  Habitat also had no cabinet set
aside for the Landlord as she had claimed.  He testified that despite an
agreement with A.A., A.A. only paid $125.00 of his $600.00 invoice for the work
completed in the rental unit; he confirmed that the Tenant paid the balance. 
He ultimately obtained the cabinets for the rental unit at Habitat, but
emphasized that these were not owned or set aside by the Landlord.
19.  B.B. also confirmed that the state of the Tenant’s kitchen
was “deplorable” and that she was using cutlery stored in boxes for meals as
there was no usable kitchen in the residence.
20.  The Tenant testified that she was understandably anxious
over the presence of maggots in the rental unit. 
21.  While she waited on repairs to her kitchen and now removed
sink, the Tenant was compelled to wash her dishes in the bathroom sink and tub,
as confirmed by photographs submitted at the hearing.  She testified that the
kitchen island and leak issues were eventually resolved in early January, 2018.
22.  A.A. did not dispute the Tenant’s evidence of the leak or
the ensuing maggots in the kitchen, but emphasized that she opened up the part
of the floor where they were discovered and waited one day to confirm that the
problem had been resolved.  I agree with A.A. that there was no logic in replacing
the cabinetry until the maggots had been eradicated.  However, on the evidence,
she appears to have taken no further steps in September, 2017 to confirm that
the problem was fully resolved when the Tenant did not advise her whether or
not there were still maggots in the kitchen.
23.  With respect to a serious health issue such as vermin in
the rental unit, I find that it was incumbent on the Landlord to take proactive
measures to confirm that these pests have been fully exterminated.
24.  For this reason, I find that the Landlord should have
entered the rental unit to resolve this issue as soon as possible.  While
A.A.’s consideration of the Tenant’s privacy while her mother was hospitalized
is laudable, the parties agreed that the Tenant was absent from the rental unit
for much of October, 2017.  During that period, the Landlord could have easily
completed the necessary repairs to the kitchen island in the Tenant’s absence
with minimal disruption to her enjoyment of the residence.
25.  As a result, I do not find that the Landlord resolved this
issue in an appropriately timely manner and therefore breached its duties under subsection 20(1) of the Act
for providing and maintaining a residential complex, including the rental units
in it, in a good state of repair and fit for habitation and for complying with
health, safety, housing and maintenance standards. 
26.  As I find that the Landlord’s breach caused substantial
disruption to the Tenant’s ability to normally reside in the rental unit and
significantly impinged on her use and enjoyment of the residence, I find that
the Tenant is entitled to an abatement of rent structured as follows:
a.    Loss of use of the kitchen sink from August 20,
2017 to January 1, 2018 at 15% ($697.15);
b.    Loss of the kitchen island from September 14, 2017
to January 31, 2018 at 5% ($237.62);
c.    Maggot infestation in rental unit for one month
at 50% ($525.00).
27.  Since neither the Tenant nor B.B. were particularly
specific in their recollections of dates, I have selected the narrowest ranges
of dates provided in their evidence at the hearing as the most reliable
evidence.  This remedy is intended to include compensation for the stress
suffered by the Tenant as a result of the Landlord’s delay in restoring her
kitchen.
28.  While the Tenant also requested compensation for her out of
pocket expenses incurred to pay B.B. for his renovation work, the evidence
indicated that the Tenant was not authorized to replace the dishwasher in the
rental unit and did not lead evidence to suggest that this work related to a
maintenance breach properly brought to the Landlord’s attention, let alone
included as a cause of action in either application.  As B.B.’s invoice failed
to itemize the cost of the replacement cabinetry separate from the unauthorized
upgrades, it is not possible to order compensation for the eligible items
alone.  As a result, this compensation will not be ordered.
29.   Lastly, the Tenant requested an award of $500.00
in “non-pecuniary damages” based upon the stress she endured while the
Landlord’s delayed repairing the issues in the rental unit.  The Tenant most
likely seeks an award of general damages pursuant to paragraph (9) of
subsection 30(1) of the Act.  As I noted above, the ordered abatement is intended
to address the emotional consequences of the Landlord’s conduct.  
30.   As well, the threshold for imposing general
damages would require extremely egregious conduct on the part of the Landlord. 
The leading authority on this issue is the Ontario Divisional Court’s analysis
in Mejia v. Cagini.[1] 
In that case, an unquestionably toxic relationship between the parties
culminated in an assault upon the tenant by three friends of the landlord, in
the landlord’s presence.  The Ontario Rental Housing Tribunal found the
assault took place in the presence of the tenant’s family and that its purpose
was to put pressure upon the tenant to vacate the premises.  The tenant
was required to attend hospital for treatment.  The Tribunal did not find
that the landlord had himself committed the assault, but found that he did
nothing to stop it and that he was responsible for the actions of his
friends.  The Tribunal found that the landlord had thereby interfered with
the reasonable use and enjoyment of the apartment by the tenant and his family
and awarded general damages.
31.   In light of all of the
circumstances, I do not find that the Landlord’s conduct in the present case
rises to the level of seriousness that would warrant an order of general
damages apart from the ordered abatement. 
The Hot Water Heater
32.  The Tenant testified that whenever it rains, the basement
tends to flood.  She offered no other details on the amount of water in the
basement or its effect on her use of the space.  However, between August 28 and
August 29, 2017, the Windsor area received substantial rainfall, resulting in
flooding of many homes, including this rental unit.  The Tenant stated that she
“lost everything in the flood” and that her washer and dryer as well as the hot
water heater were immersed in over one foot of water.
33.  The Landlord did not replace the heater for four weeks.  In
the interim, the Tenant states that she was forced to wash her laundry
elsewhere, taking cabs about the city.  While she described this out of pocket
expense as “cabs were killer,” she did not explain why she was unable to use a
more economical method of public transit.  Although A.A. did not contest the
Tenant’s evidence that the hot water heater was not repaired for four weeks,
the Tenant did not offer any explanation why her laundry could not have been
washed with cold water as she did not suggest that the washing machine was
disabled by the flood.  Although she estimated the total cost of commuting
through Windsor to attend commercial laundries at $300.00, she was unable to substantiate
this estimate with any receipts or other documentation at the hearing.
34.  However, the Tenant acknowledged that she waited for two or
three days before notifying A.A. of the flood in her basement as she presumed
that A.A. must know that the house was affected.  This necessarily delayed
resolution of the issue and may have caused irreparable damage to the heater that
could have been prevented had the Tenant contacted A.A. more promptly.
35.  While the Tenant testified about high hydro bills and the
Landlord’s slow and allegedly inadequate cleaning of the basement, as these
issues were not mentioned in the applications, the Tenant denied the Landlord
reasonable notice that she intended to raise these issues at the hearing.  As a
result, these issues will form no part of the order to follow other than as
context for the deteriorating relationship between the parties.
36.  A.A. testified that as soon as she was notified of the
water in the basement, she attended at the rental unit.  She attempted to
contact a restoration company; however, as much of Windsor had been affected by
severe flooding, none were available in short order.
37.  However, when she and O.A. attended at the rental unit to
inspect the damage, the Tenant’s boyfriend told them not to worry about the
basement and that he would take care of it.  While the Tenant was reluctant to
allow A.A. to enter the rental unit or to assist her with cleaning the
basement, A.A. insisted on addressing the issue as soon as possible to avoid
further damage.  She testified that she was able to remove most of the Tenant’s
property from the affected area and cleaned approximately half of the basement. 

38.  In her own testimony, the Tenant expressed dissatisfaction
with the assistance offered by A.A. and her husband, more in relation to the
speed of their efforts.  As she put it, they “moved like turtles.”
39.  Despite numerous hisses and gasps of derision, the Tenant
did not substantively contest A.A.’s testimony that her boyfriend largely
commandeered the repairs to the basement, insisting on various supplies and
interfering with the efforts of the Landlord’s contractors to replace the
tank.  This version of events was confirmed by a letter from E.P., A.A.’s
regular contractor stating that when he initially attended at the rental unit
to complete the work, the Tenant’s boyfriend interfered with his efforts and
insisted that he complete the work himself.  To that end, the boyfriend gave
A.A. a lengthy list of materials that a later electrician deemed unnecessary
and serving only to waste time.
40.  Unlike the issues in the kitchen, the evidence with respect
to the delay in replacing the water heater includes a significant element of interference
by the Tenant and her boyfriend despite the Landlord’s concerted efforts to
resolve the issue.  As well, particular circumstances related to the widespread
flooding of basements throughout the city at the time hampered A.A.’s
reasonable access to remediation that could have been more readily available at
other times.
41.  Putting
aside the Tenant’s failure to request a remedy for the items allegedly damaged
in the basement by the flood itself, she also failed to demonstrate that the
Landlord could have reasonably anticipated this event.  In McQuestion v.
Schneider, the Ontario Court of Appeal held that liability for injuries or
damages could not be imposed on a landlord who had no knowledge or could not reasonably be expected to have knowledge of a
maintenance problem.[2] 
The Court held that then subsection 96(1) of the Landlord and Tenant Act
(now subsection 20(1) of the Act):
… does not impose an absolute liability upon a landlord for
any injuries or damages that may be caused by a latent defect, of which the
landlord has no knowledge, nor could reasonably be expected to have had such
knowledge. To alter the law so drastically as to impose strict liability on a
landlord, regardless of his knowledge or constructive knowledge, would require
much more precise language.[3]
42.  In
light of the all of evidence at the hearing, I find that the extreme flooding in
August, 2017 was not reasonably foreseeable.  While the Tenant testified that
the basement was subject to occasional wetness, on the evidence, the sheer
volume of water entering the rental unit in the last days of August, 2017 was
unexpected and unforeseeable.  There was also no evidence that the Tenant had
even notified the Landlord of the more minor moisture issues in the rental
unit.  As a result, I do not find that the Landlord failed to meet its
maintenance obligations under subsection 20(1) of the Act with respect to the
initial flooding.  As a result, the Landlord cannot be held liable for the
Tenant’s initial losses caused by the flood itself.  
43.  In Onyskiw v. CJM Property Management Ltd. the
Ontario Court of Appeal rejected a long-standing presumption that a landlord
may be deemed immediately in breach of subsection 20(1) of the Act once a
defect arises: 
58.  If the
legislature intended an automatic breach of the landlord’s duty to maintain and
repair as soon as a service was interrupted, there would be no need for the
Board to make a determination as to whether the landlord had breached its
obligation. The legislation would instead simply provide that where a service
has been interrupted the landlord is in breach of its duty to maintain and
repair and provide that the Board “may” award a remedy under s. 30(1) which
authorizes a range of remedies including an abatement of rent.
59.  The
tenants’ position that the landlord is automatically in breach of its statutory
obligation to maintain and repair even while something is being repaired also
offends the legal maxim lex non cogit ad
impossibilia: that the legislature does not intend compliance
where, for all practical purposes, it is impossible: see Côté, The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada, at p.
479.
60.  Applying
general principles of statutory interpretation, I would reject the tenants’
submission that, when the RTA is properly interpreted, a landlord is
automatically in breach of its obligation to repair and maintain under s. 20(1)
as soon as an interruption in service occurs.[4]
 
44.  The prior leading authority on this issue was the Supreme
Court of Canada’s decision in Pajelle Investments Ltd. v. Herbold.[5]  However, as the
Court in Onyskiw held, in light of the evolution in the law in the
decades since that case was decided, Pajelle also stands for the
principle that a contextual approach is necessary when considering whether the
landlord responded appropriately to a maintenance defect.  Such a reading is
appropriate having regard to the interpretive principle that legislation enacted
to regulate an activity that is ongoing over an extended period of time invites
a dynamic, as opposed to a fixed, interpretation.[6]
45.  This contextual approach is also consistent with the
Board’s Interpretation Guideline 5, which states as follows:
If a landlord
has done little maintenance for an extended period, and a serious condition
results that takes some time to rectify, the landlord should be responsible for
the tenants’ loss of use of their unit or the common facilities during the
repairs.  However, if the landlord has a reasonable program of maintenance,
including preventative maintenance, and is acting responsibly to rectify a
problem that requires extensive repairs, an abatement of rent should not be
ordered.
46.  The Tenant’s Agent relied upon an
earlier decision of the Landlord and Tenant Board (the ‘Board’), CET-29301-14,
issued on March 26, 2013.  While past decisions of the Board are not binding on
me, it is worth noting that this order predates Onyskiw.  In
CET-29301-13, the Member relied upon the now outdated contractual analysis of Offredi
v. 751768 Ontario Ltd.[7] 
As a result, I find that this case is of no assistance.
47.  Following the analysis in Onyskiw, I find
that since the Landlord demonstrated a proactive program of maintenance and
acted responsibly and in a very timely manner to resolve the Tenant’s concerns
and was obstructed by the unreasonable actions of the Tenant’s boyfriend, it
was not in breach of its responsibilities under subsection 20(1) of the Act
with respect to the water heater.
Other Issues
48.  The tenancy agreement was signed by the Tenant and A.A. on
July 20, 2017.  On the second page of the contract, the parties agreed to the
following additional conditions:
Landlord
agrees to supply the following:
Screens
(2)
More
Cupboards and Counter top for the kitchen.
1
window already ordered for the rear bedroom.
Storm
door (longer)
49.  Both the Tenant and A.A. signed below this addendum.  The
Tenant acknowledged that the Landlord has replaced one double pane window.
50.  However, none of these issues, or another problem with a
door, were mentioned in either application.  As a result, the Tenant failed to
provide the Landlord with reasonable notice that she intended to raise these
issues at the hearing.  Consequently, these issues will form no part of the order
to follow.
51.  This order contains all of the reasons in this matter and
no further reasons will issue.
It is ordered that:
The L1 and the T6 Applications

 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before June 30,
2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $1,897.87*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to June 8, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit and less the amount of the abatement the Landlord owes the Tenant.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $34.52 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
June 9, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 30, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from July 1,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 30, 2018, then starting July 1, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 1, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before June 30,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $3,965.23** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if she
pays the amount required under that subsection on or after July 1, 2018, but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.  The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
The T2 Application
10.  The Tenant’s application is dismissed.

Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006

Numbers: SWL-13901-18
SWT-14627-18
Ontario Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for
an order to terminate the tenancy and evict KM (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (the ‘L1 Application’).
The Tenant applied for an order determining
that the Landlord, the Landlord’s superintendent or
the Landlord’s agent withheld or deliberately interfered with the reasonable
supply of a vital service, care service, or food that the Landlord is obligated
to supply under the tenancy agreement (the ‘T2 Application’).
The Tenant also applied
for an order determining that the Landlord failed to meet the Landlord’s
maintenance obligations under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') or failed to comply with health, safety, housing or maintenance
standards (the ‘T6 Application’).
These applications were heard in [CITY] on
May 23, 2018. The Landlord’s Agent, AA, the Tenant,
the Tenant’s Agent, GL, and the witness, BB, attended the hearing.
Preliminary Issues:
1.  The Tenant’s applications are amended to remove
A.A. as a party.
2.  The submitted tenancy agreement indicates that
the Landlord is a second mortgagee. The first mortgagee, P.B., was not served
with Notice of the Hearing. However, as A.A. advised that her corporation had
purchased the entirety of P.B.’s interest in the rental unit, I find no
prejudice to P.B. in proceeding with the hearing in his absence.
Determinations and
Reasons:
The L1 Application
3.  The Tenant has not paid the total rent she was
required to pay for the period from February 1, 2018 to May 31, 2018. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective February
17, 2018.
4.  The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit.
5.  The monthly rent is $1,050.00.
6.  The Landlord collected a rent deposit of
$1,050.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
7.  Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenant for the period from July 22, 2017 to February 17, 2018.
8.  The parties agree that the amount outstanding to
May 31, 2018, inclusive of rent arrears ($4,200.00) and costs ($175.00), is
$4,375.00. At the hearing, the Tenant agreed that she was four months in
arrears. While she acknowledged that she wilfully withheld the rent in
retaliation for the outstanding maintenance issues, she also testified that
P.B. had attended at the rental unit and instructed her to pay the rent only to
him, rather than A.A. in response to a financial conflict between the two
mortgagees. It is unclear if P.B.’s interference was a substantial factor in
the Tenant’s failure to pay the arrears as she did not pay him any portion of
the outstanding balance either.
9.  The Tenant supports three children on a rather
limited income and has so far been unable to find alternate housing in her
price range. She requested that the eviction be postponed until the end of
June, 2018 to allow her children to complete their school year. On the balance
of probabilities, I find that the Tenant will reasonably require additional
time to either void the order for eviction or secure new accommodations.
10. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act and find that it would not be
unfair to postpone the eviction until June 30, 2018, pursuant to subsection
83(1)(b) of the Act.
The T2 Application
11. According to the Tenant’s description of this issue in the
T2 Application and the evidence submitted at the hearing, the problem related
to a maintenance issue with the hot water heater rather than a situation in
which the Landlord or its agent withheld hot water from the Tenant or wilfully
interfered with its supply.
12. As a result, I find that the Tenant should have included
this issue under the T6 Application rather than under the present T2
Application. As the Act provides different remedies with regard to a
maintenance application compared to a T2 Application, the forms are not
interchangeable.
13. Since the Landlord received notice that the Tenant intended
to raise this issue at the hearing, the matter of the hot water heater has been
addressed below under the proper T6 Application.
14. Therefore, I do not find that the Landlord, the Landlord's
superintendent or the Landlord's agent withheld
a reasonable supply of a vital service, care service, or food that the Landlord
was obligated to supply under the tenancy agreement or deliberately interfered
with the reasonable supply of vital service, care service, or food.
The T6 Application – Water Leaks and the Kitchen Sink
15. The Tenant testified that she discovered that the kitchen
sink was leaking when she moved into the rental unit on July 21, 2017. The
sink is located on a kitchen island with cabinets. She notified the Landlord
of these issues on August 20, 2017 and around the same time, she also
discovered a maggot infestation that appeared to originate from under the
kitchen island. On or about September 14, 2017, A.A.’s husband, O.A., attended
at the rental unit to investigate and conduct repairs. She stated that he
removed the sink and cupboards, but promised to return the next day to complete
the work. However, this did not occur. Removal of the sink did not resolve
the underlying leak issue.
16. At the hearing, she submitted photographs of the flooring
that had been under the moved kitchen island, showing a considerable amount of
food and other debris accumulated in this area. Other images show several
maggots moving along what appears to be a baseboard or some other surface in
the rental unit. She recalled that these photographs were taken at some point
in September, 2017. She testified that in October, 2017, she discovered the
remains of a one kilogram bag of dog food under the baseboards under the
island. This and other garbage wedged into the flooring apparently provided a
food source for the maggots.
17. She testified that O.A. did not return for five months and
the issue was only resolved when she replaced the cabinetry at her own expense.
She submitted a receipt from B.B., her own contractor. This document
indicated that he installed kitchen cabinets, a new countertop, sink and faucet
and completed all associated electrical plumbing and electrical work. He also
installed a new dishwasher. The total that B.B. charged for this work was
$600.00. The receipt indicated that the Tenant had paid $125.00 of this amount
as of February 22, 2018, leaving a balance of $475.00 outstanding. The Tenant
testified that she ultimately paid the full balance as A.A. refused to pay on
the grounds that she had not authorized the work.
18. B.B. has known the Tenant for approximately twenty years.
He has approximately twelve years’ experience in carpentry and related trades.
He testified that A.A. sent him to pick up a new kitchen cabinet at Habitat for
Humanity (‘Habitat’) for the rental unit at some point in February, 2018 and advised
him that she had a credit with that agency. When he attended at Habitat, he
discovered that no such credit was on file. Habitat also had no cabinet set
aside for the Landlord as she had claimed. He testified that despite an
agreement with A.A., A.A. only paid $125.00 of his $600.00 invoice for the work
completed in the rental unit; he confirmed that the Tenant paid the balance.
He ultimately obtained the cabinets for the rental unit at Habitat, but
emphasized that these were not owned or set aside by the Landlord.
19. B.B. also confirmed that the state of the Tenant’s kitchen
was “deplorable” and that she was using cutlery stored in boxes for meals as
there was no usable kitchen in the residence.
20. The Tenant testified that she was understandably anxious
over the presence of maggots in the rental unit.
21. While she waited on repairs to her kitchen and now removed
sink, the Tenant was compelled to wash her dishes in the bathroom sink and tub,
as confirmed by photographs submitted at the hearing. She testified that the
kitchen island and leak issues were eventually resolved in early January, 2018.
22. A.A. did not dispute the Tenant’s evidence of the leak or
the ensuing maggots in the kitchen, but emphasized that she opened up the part
of the floor where they were discovered and waited one day to confirm that the
problem had been resolved. I agree with A.A. that there was no logic in replacing
the cabinetry until the maggots had been eradicated. However, on the evidence,
she appears to have taken no further steps in September, 2017 to confirm that
the problem was fully resolved when the Tenant did not advise her whether or
not there were still maggots in the kitchen.
23. With respect to a serious health issue such as vermin in
the rental unit, I find that it was incumbent on the Landlord to take proactive
measures to confirm that these pests have been fully exterminated.
24. For this reason, I find that the Landlord should have
entered the rental unit to resolve this issue as soon as possible. While
A.A.’s consideration of the Tenant’s privacy while her mother was hospitalized
is laudable, the parties agreed that the Tenant was absent from the rental unit
for much of October, 2017. During that period, the Landlord could have easily
completed the necessary repairs to the kitchen island in the Tenant’s absence
with minimal disruption to her enjoyment of the residence.
25. As a result, I do not find that the Landlord resolved this
issue in an appropriately timely manner and therefore breached its duties under subsection 20(1) of the Act
for providing and maintaining a residential complex, including the rental units
in it, in a good state of repair and fit for habitation and for complying with
health, safety, housing and maintenance standards.
26. As I find that the Landlord’s breach caused substantial
disruption to the Tenant’s ability to normally reside in the rental unit and
significantly impinged on her use and enjoyment of the residence, I find that
the Tenant is entitled to an abatement of rent structured as follows:
a.  Loss of use of the kitchen sink from August 20,
2017 to January 1, 2018 at 15% ($697.15);
b.  Loss of the kitchen island from September 14, 2017
to January 31, 2018 at 5% ($237.62);
c.  Maggot infestation in rental unit for one month
at 50% ($525.00).
27. Since neither the Tenant nor B.B. were particularly
specific in their recollections of dates, I have selected the narrowest ranges
of dates provided in their evidence at the hearing as the most reliable
evidence. This remedy is intended to include compensation for the stress
suffered by the Tenant as a result of the Landlord’s delay in restoring her
kitchen.
28. While the Tenant also requested compensation for her out of
pocket expenses incurred to pay B.B. for his renovation work, the evidence
indicated that the Tenant was not authorized to replace the dishwasher in the
rental unit and did not lead evidence to suggest that this work related to a
maintenance breach properly brought to the Landlord’s attention, let alone
included as a cause of action in either application. As B.B.’s invoice failed
to itemize the cost of the replacement cabinetry separate from the unauthorized
upgrades, it is not possible to order compensation for the eligible items
alone. As a result, this compensation will not be ordered.
29. Lastly, the Tenant requested an award of $500.00
in “non-pecuniary damages” based upon the stress she endured while the
Landlord’s delayed repairing the issues in the rental unit. The Tenant most
likely seeks an award of general damages pursuant to paragraph (9) of
subsection 30(1) of the Act. As I noted above, the ordered abatement is intended
to address the emotional consequences of the Landlord’s conduct.
30. As well, the threshold for imposing general
damages would require extremely egregious conduct on the part of the Landlord.
The leading authority on this issue is the Ontario Divisional Court’s analysis
in Mejia v. Cagini.[1]
In that case, an unquestionably toxic relationship between the parties
culminated in an assault upon the tenant by three friends of the landlord, in
the landlord’s presence. The Ontario Rental Housing Tribunal found the
assault took place in the presence of the tenant’s family and that its purpose
was to put pressure upon the tenant to vacate the premises. The tenant
was required to attend hospital for treatment. The Tribunal did not find
that the landlord had himself committed the assault, but found that he did
nothing to stop it and that he was responsible for the actions of his
friends. The Tribunal found that the landlord had thereby interfered with
the reasonable use and enjoyment of the apartment by the tenant and his family
and awarded general damages.
31. In light of all of the
circumstances, I do not find that the Landlord’s conduct in the present case
rises to the level of seriousness that would warrant an order of general
damages apart from the ordered abatement.
The Hot Water Heater
32. The Tenant testified that whenever it rains, the basement
tends to flood. She offered no other details on the amount of water in the
basement or its effect on her use of the space. However, between August 28 and
August 29, 2017, the Windsor area received substantial rainfall, resulting in
flooding of many homes, including this rental unit. The Tenant stated that she
“lost everything in the flood” and that her washer and dryer as well as the hot
water heater were immersed in over one foot of water.
33. The Landlord did not replace the heater for four weeks. In
the interim, the Tenant states that she was forced to wash her laundry
elsewhere, taking cabs about the city. While she described this out of pocket
expense as “cabs were killer,” she did not explain why she was unable to use a
more economical method of public transit. Although A.A. did not contest the
Tenant’s evidence that the hot water heater was not repaired for four weeks,
the Tenant did not offer any explanation why her laundry could not have been
washed with cold water as she did not suggest that the washing machine was
disabled by the flood. Although she estimated the total cost of commuting
through Windsor to attend commercial laundries at $300.00, she was unable to substantiate
this estimate with any receipts or other documentation at the hearing.
34. However, the Tenant acknowledged that she waited for two or
three days before notifying A.A. of the flood in her basement as she presumed
that A.A. must know that the house was affected. This necessarily delayed
resolution of the issue and may have caused irreparable damage to the heater that
could have been prevented had the Tenant contacted A.A. more promptly.
35. While the Tenant testified about high hydro bills and the
Landlord’s slow and allegedly inadequate cleaning of the basement, as these
issues were not mentioned in the applications, the Tenant denied the Landlord
reasonable notice that she intended to raise these issues at the hearing. As a
result, these issues will form no part of the order to follow other than as
context for the deteriorating relationship between the parties.
36. A.A. testified that as soon as she was notified of the
water in the basement, she attended at the rental unit. She attempted to
contact a restoration company; however, as much of Windsor had been affected by
severe flooding, none were available in short order.
37. However, when she and O.A. attended at the rental unit to
inspect the damage, the Tenant’s boyfriend told them not to worry about the
basement and that he would take care of it. While the Tenant was reluctant to
allow A.A. to enter the rental unit or to assist her with cleaning the
basement, A.A. insisted on addressing the issue as soon as possible to avoid
further damage. She testified that she was able to remove most of the Tenant’s
property from the affected area and cleaned approximately half of the basement.
38. In her own testimony, the Tenant expressed dissatisfaction
with the assistance offered by A.A. and her husband, more in relation to the
speed of their efforts. As she put it, they “moved like turtles.”
39. Despite numerous hisses and gasps of derision, the Tenant
did not substantively contest A.A.’s testimony that her boyfriend largely
commandeered the repairs to the basement, insisting on various supplies and
interfering with the efforts of the Landlord’s contractors to replace the
tank. This version of events was confirmed by a letter from E.P., A.A.’s
regular contractor stating that when he initially attended at the rental unit
to complete the work, the Tenant’s boyfriend interfered with his efforts and
insisted that he complete the work himself. To that end, the boyfriend gave
A.A. a lengthy list of materials that a later electrician deemed unnecessary
and serving only to waste time.
40. Unlike the issues in the kitchen, the evidence with respect
to the delay in replacing the water heater includes a significant element of interference
by the Tenant and her boyfriend despite the Landlord’s concerted efforts to
resolve the issue. As well, particular circumstances related to the widespread
flooding of basements throughout the city at the time hampered A.A.’s
reasonable access to remediation that could have been more readily available at
other times.
41. Putting
aside the Tenant’s failure to request a remedy for the items allegedly damaged
in the basement by the flood itself, she also failed to demonstrate that the
Landlord could have reasonably anticipated this event. In McQuestion v.
Schneider, the Ontario Court of Appeal held that liability for injuries or
damages could not be imposed on a landlord who had no knowledge or could not reasonably be expected to have knowledge of a
maintenance problem.[2]
The Court held that then subsection 96(1) of the Landlord and Tenant Act
(now subsection 20(1) of the Act):
… does not impose an absolute liability upon a landlord for
any injuries or damages that may be caused by a latent defect, of which the
landlord has no knowledge, nor could reasonably be expected to have had such
knowledge. To alter the law so drastically as to impose strict liability on a
landlord, regardless of his knowledge or constructive knowledge, would require
much more precise language.[3]
42. In
light of the all of evidence at the hearing, I find that the extreme flooding in
August, 2017 was not reasonably foreseeable. While the Tenant testified that
the basement was subject to occasional wetness, on the evidence, the sheer
volume of water entering the rental unit in the last days of August, 2017 was
unexpected and unforeseeable. There was also no evidence that the Tenant had
even notified the Landlord of the more minor moisture issues in the rental
unit. As a result, I do not find that the Landlord failed to meet its
maintenance obligations under subsection 20(1) of the Act with respect to the
initial flooding. As a result, the Landlord cannot be held liable for the
Tenant’s initial losses caused by the flood itself.
43. In Onyskiw v. CJM Property Management Ltd. the
Ontario Court of Appeal rejected a long-standing presumption that a landlord
may be deemed immediately in breach of subsection 20(1) of the Act once a
defect arises:
58. If the
legislature intended an automatic breach of the landlord’s duty to maintain and
repair as soon as a service was interrupted, there would be no need for the
Board to make a determination as to whether the landlord had breached its
obligation. The legislation would instead simply provide that where a service
has been interrupted the landlord is in breach of its duty to maintain and
repair and provide that the Board “may” award a remedy under s. 30(1) which
authorizes a range of remedies including an abatement of rent.
59. The
tenants’ position that the landlord is automatically in breach of its statutory
obligation to maintain and repair even while something is being repaired also
offends the legal maximlex non cogit ad
impossibilia:that the legislature does not intend compliance
where, for all practical purposes, it is impossible: see Côté,The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada, at p.
479.
60. Applying
general principles of statutory interpretation, I would reject the tenants’
submission that, when the RTA is properly interpreted, a landlord is
automatically in breach of its obligation to repair and maintain under s. 20(1)
as soon as an interruption in service occurs.[4]
44. The prior leading authority on this issue was the Supreme
Court of Canada’s decision in Pajelle Investments Ltd. v. Herbold.[5] However, as the
Court in Onyskiw held, in light of the evolution in the law in the
decades since that case was decided, Pajelle also stands for the
principle that a contextual approach is necessary when considering whether the
landlord responded appropriately to a maintenance defect. Such a reading is
appropriate having regard to the interpretive principle that legislation enacted
to regulate an activity that is ongoing over an extended period of time invites
a dynamic, as opposed to a fixed, interpretation.[6]
45. This contextual approach is also consistent with the
Board’s Interpretation Guideline 5, which states as follows:
If a landlord
has done little maintenance for an extended period, and a serious condition
results that takes some time to rectify, the landlord should be responsible for
the tenants’ loss of use of their unit or the common facilities during the
repairs. However, if the landlord has a reasonable program of maintenance,
including preventative maintenance, and is acting responsibly to rectify a
problem that requires extensive repairs, an abatement of rent should not be
ordered.
46. The Tenant’s Agent relied upon an
earlier decision of the Landlord and Tenant Board (the ‘Board’), CET-29301-14,
issued on March 26, 2013. While past decisions of the Board are not binding on
me, it is worth noting that this order predates Onyskiw. In
CET-29301-13, the Member relied upon the now outdated contractual analysis of Offredi
v. 751768 Ontario Ltd.[7]
As a result, I find that this case is of no assistance.
47. Following the analysis in Onyskiw, I find
that since the Landlord demonstrated a proactive program of maintenance and
acted responsibly and in a very timely manner to resolve the Tenant’s concerns
and was obstructed by the unreasonable actions of the Tenant’s boyfriend, it
was not in breach of its responsibilities under subsection 20(1) of the Act
with respect to the water heater.
Other Issues
48. The tenancy agreement was signed by the Tenant and A.A. on
July 20, 2017. On the second page of the contract, the parties agreed to the
following additional conditions:
Landlord
agrees to supply the following:
Screens
(2)
More
Cupboards and Counter top for the kitchen.
1
window already ordered for the rear bedroom.
Storm
door (longer)
49. Both the Tenant and A.A. signed below this addendum. The
Tenant acknowledged that the Landlord has replaced one double pane window.
50. However, none of these issues, or another problem with a
door, were mentioned in either application. As a result, the Tenant failed to
provide the Landlord with reasonable notice that she intended to raise these
issues at the hearing. Consequently, these issues will form no part of the order
to follow.
51. This order contains all of the reasons in this matter and
no further reasons will issue.
It is ordered that:
The L1 and the T6 Applications
1.
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before June 30,
2018.
2.
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $1,897.87*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to June 8, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit and less the amount of the abatement the Landlord owes the Tenant.
3.
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $34.52 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
June 9, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 30, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from July 1,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 30, 2018, then starting July 1, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 1, 2018.
8.
If, on or before June 30,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $3,965.23** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if she
pays the amount required under that subsection on or after July 1, 2018, but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
The T2 Application
10. The Tenant’s application is dismissed.
June 8, 2018                       _______________________

(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict KM (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (the ‘L1 Application’). The Tenant applied for an order determining that the Landlord, the Landlord’s superintendent or the Landlord’s agent withheld or deliberately interfered with the reasonable supply of a vital service, care service, or food that the Landlord is obligated to supply under the tenancy agreement (the ‘T2 Application’). The Tenant also applied for an order determining that the Landlord failed to meet the Landlord’s maintenance obligations under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') or failed to comply with health, safety, housing or maintenance standards (the ‘T6 Application’). These applications were heard in [CITY] on May 23, 2018. The Landlord’s Agent, AA, the Tenant, the Tenant’s Agent, GL, and the witness, BB, attended the hearing. Preliminary Issues: 1.  The Tenant’s applications are amended to remove A.A. as a party. 2.  The submitted tenancy agreement indicates that the Landlord is a second mortgagee. The first mortgagee, P.B., was not served with Notice of the Hearing. However, as A.A. advised that her corporation had purchased the entirety of P.B.’s interest in the rental unit, I find no prejudice to P.B. in proceeding with the hearing in his absence. Determinations and Reasons: The L1 Application 3.  The Tenant has not paid the total rent she was required to pay for the period from February 1, 2018 to May 31, 2018. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective February 17, 2018. 4.  The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 5.  The monthly rent is $1,050.00. 6.  The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,050.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord. 7.  Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 22, 2017 to February 17, 2018. 8.  The parties agree that the amount outstanding to May 31, 2018, inclusive of rent arrears ($4,200.00) and costs ($175.00), is $4,375.00. At the hearing, the Tenant agreed that she was four months in arrears. While she acknowledged that she wilfully withheld the rent in retaliation for the outstanding maintenance issues, she also testified that P.B. had attended at the rental unit and instructed her to pay the rent only to him, rather than A.A. in response to a financial conflict between the two mortgagees. It is unclear if P.B.’s interference was a substantial factor in the Tenant’s failure to pay the arrears as she did not pay him any portion of the outstanding balance either. 9.  The Tenant supports three children on a rather limited income and has so far been unable to find alternate housing in her price range. She requested that the eviction be postponed until the end of June, 2018 to allow her children to complete their school year. On the balance of probabilities, I find that the Tenant will reasonably require additional time to either void the order for eviction or secure new accommodations. 10. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until June 30, 2018, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. The T2 Application 11. According to the Tenant’s description of this issue in the T2 Application and the evidence submitted at the hearing, the problem related to a maintenance issue with the hot water heater rather than a situation in which the Landlord or its agent withheld hot water from the Tenant or wilfully interfered with its supply. 12. As a result, I find that the Tenant should have included this issue under the T6 Application rather than under the present T2 Application. As the Act provides different remedies with regard to a maintenance application compared to a T2 Application, the forms are not interchangeable. 13. Since the Landlord received notice that the Tenant intended to raise this issue at the hearing, the matter of the hot water heater has been addressed below under the proper T6 Application. 14. Therefore, I do not find that the Landlord, the Landlord's superintendent or the Landlord's agent withheld a reasonable supply of a vital service, care service, or food that the Landlord was obligated to supply under the tenancy agreement or deliberately interfered with the reasonable supply of vital service, care service, or food. The T6 Application – Water Leaks and the Kitchen Sink 15. The Tenant testified that she discovered that the kitchen sink was leaking when she moved into the rental unit on July 21, 2017. The sink is located on a kitchen island with cabinets. She notified the Landlord of these issues on August 20, 2017 and around the same time, she also discovered a maggot infestation that appeared to originate from under the kitchen island. On or about September 14, 2017, A.A.’s husband, O.A., attended at the rental unit to investigate and conduct repairs. She stated that he removed the sink and cupboards, but promised to return the next day to complete the work. However, this did not occur. Removal of the sink did not resolve the underlying leak issue. 16. At the hearing, she submitted photographs of the flooring that had been under the moved kitchen island, showing a considerable amount of food and other debris accumulated in this area. Other images show several maggots moving along what appears to be a baseboard or some other surface in the rental unit. She recalled that these photographs were taken at some point in September, 2017. She testified that in October, 2017, she discovered the remains of a one kilogram bag of dog food under the baseboards under the island. This and other garbage wedged into the flooring apparently provided a food source for the maggots. 17. She testified that O.A. did not return for five months and the issue was only resolved when she replaced the cabinetry at her own expense. She submitted a receipt from B.B., her own contractor. This document indicated that he installed kitchen cabinets, a new countertop, sink and faucet and completed all associated electrical plumbing and electrical work. He also installed a new dishwasher. The total that B.B. charged for this work was $600.00. The receipt indicated that the Tenant had paid $125.00 of this amount as of February 22, 2018, leaving a balance of $475.00 outstanding. The Tenant testified that she ultimately paid the full balance as A.A. refused to pay on the grounds that she had not authorized the work. 18. B.B. has known the Tenant for approximately twenty years. He has approximately twelve years’ experience in carpentry and related trades. He testified that A.A. sent him to pick up a new kitchen cabinet at Habitat for Humanity (‘Habitat’) for the rental unit at some point in February, 2018 and advised him that she had a credit with that agency. When he attended at Habitat, he discovered that no such credit was on file. Habitat also had no cabinet set aside for the Landlord as she had claimed. He testified that despite an agreement with A.A., A.A. only paid $125.00 of his $600.00 invoice for the work completed in the rental unit; he confirmed that the Tenant paid the balance. He ultimately obtained the cabinets for the rental unit at Habitat, but emphasized that these were not owned or set aside by the Landlord. 19. B.B. also confirmed that the state of the Tenant’s kitchen was “deplorable” and that she was using cutlery stored in boxes for meals as there was no usable kitchen in the residence. 20. The Tenant testified that she was understandably anxious over the presence of maggots in the rental unit. 21. While she waited on repairs to her kitchen and now removed sink, the Tenant was compelled to wash her dishes in the bathroom sink and tub, as confirmed by photographs submitted at the hearing. She testified that the kitchen island and leak issues were eventually resolved in early January, 2018. 22. A.A. did not dispute the Tenant’s evidence of the leak or the ensuing maggots in the kitchen, but emphasized that she opened up the part of the floor where they were discovered and waited one day to confirm that the problem had been resolved. I agree with A.A. that there was no logic in replacing the cabinetry until the maggots had been eradicated. However, on the evidence, she appears to have taken no further steps in September, 2017 to confirm that the problem was fully resolved when the Tenant did not advise her whether or not there were still maggots in the kitchen. 23. With respect to a serious health issue such as vermin in the rental unit, I find that it was incumbent on the Landlord to take proactive measures to confirm that these pests have been fully exterminated. 24. For this reason, I find that the Landlord should have entered the rental unit to resolve this issue as soon as possible. While A.A.’s consideration of the Tenant’s privacy while her mother was hospitalized is laudable, the parties agreed that the Tenant was absent from the rental unit for much of October, 2017. During that period, the Landlord could have easily completed the necessary repairs to the kitchen island in the Tenant’s absence with minimal disruption to her enjoyment of the residence. 25. As a result, I do not find that the Landlord resolved this issue in an appropriately timely manner and therefore breached its duties under subsection 20(1) of the Act for providing and maintaining a residential complex, including the rental units in it, in a good state of repair and fit for habitation and for complying with health, safety, housing and maintenance standards. 26. As I find that the Landlord’s breach caused substantial disruption to the Tenant’s ability to normally reside in the rental unit and significantly impinged on her use and enjoyment of the residence, I find that the Tenant is entitled to an abatement of rent structured as follows: a.  Loss of use of the kitchen sink from August 20, 2017 to January 1, 2018 at 15% ($697.15); b.  Loss of the kitchen island from September 14, 2017 to January 31, 2018 at 5% ($237.62); c.  Maggot infestation in rental unit for one month at 50% ($525.00). 27. Since neither the Tenant nor B.B. were particularly specific in their recollections of dates, I have selected the narrowest ranges of dates provided in their evidence at the hearing as the most reliable evidence. This remedy is intended to include compensation for the stress suffered by the Tenant as a result of the Landlord’s delay in restoring her kitchen. 28. While the Tenant also requested compensation for her out of pocket expenses incurred to pay B.B. for his renovation work, the evidence indicated that the Tenant was not authorized to replace the dishwasher in the rental unit and did not lead evidence to suggest that this work related to a maintenance breach properly brought to the Landlord’s attention, let alone included as a cause of action in either application. As B.B.’s invoice failed to itemize the cost of the replacement cabinetry separate from the unauthorized upgrades, it is not possible to order compensation for the eligible items alone. As a result, this compensation will not be ordered. 29. Lastly, the Tenant requested an award of $500.00 in “non-pecuniary damages” based upon the stress she endured while the Landlord’s delayed repairing the issues in the rental unit. The Tenant most likely seeks an award of general damages pursuant to paragraph (9) of subsection 30(1) of the Act. As I noted above, the ordered abatement is intended to address the emotional consequences of the Landlord’s conduct. 30. As well, the threshold for imposing general damages would require extremely egregious conduct on the part of the Landlord. The leading authority on this issue is the Ontario Divisional Court’s analysis in Mejia v. Cagini.[1] In that case, an unquestionably toxic relationship between the parties culminated in an assault upon the tenant by three friends of the landlord, in the landlord’s presence. The Ontario Rental Housing Tribunal found the assault took place in the presence of the tenant’s family and that its purpose was to put pressure upon the tenant to vacate the premises. The tenant was required to attend hospital for treatment. The Tribunal did not find that the landlord had himself committed the assault, but found that he did nothing to stop it and that he was responsible for the actions of his friends. The Tribunal found that the landlord had thereby interfered with the reasonable use and enjoyment of the apartment by the tenant and his family and awarded general damages. 31. In light of all of the circumstances, I do not find that the Landlord’s conduct in the present case rises to the level of seriousness that would warrant an order of general damages apart from the ordered abatement. The Hot Water Heater 32. The Tenant testified that whenever it rains, the basement tends to flood. She offered no other details on the amount of water in the basement or its effect on her use of the space. However, between August 28 and August 29, 2017, the Windsor area received substantial rainfall, resulting in flooding of many homes, including this rental unit. The Tenant stated that she “lost everything in the flood” and that her washer and dryer as well as the hot water heater were immersed in over one foot of water. 33. The Landlord did not replace the heater for four weeks. In the interim, the Tenant states that she was forced to wash her laundry elsewhere, taking cabs about the city. While she described this out of pocket expense as “cabs were killer,” she did not explain why she was unable to use a more economical method of public transit. Although A.A. did not contest the Tenant’s evidence that the hot water heater was not repaired for four weeks, the Tenant did not offer any explanation why her laundry could not have been washed with cold water as she did not suggest that the washing machine was disabled by the flood. Although she estimated the total cost of commuting through Windsor to attend commercial laundries at $300.00, she was unable to substantiate this estimate with any receipts or other documentation at the hearing. 34. However, the Tenant acknowledged that she waited for two or three days before notifying A.A. of the flood in her basement as she presumed that A.A. must know that the house was affected. This necessarily delayed resolution of the issue and may have caused irreparable damage to the heater that could have been prevented had the Tenant contacted A.A. more promptly. 35. While the Tenant testified about high hydro bills and the Landlord’s slow and allegedly inadequate cleaning of the basement, as these issues were not mentioned in the applications, the Tenant denied the Landlord reasonable notice that she intended to raise these issues at the hearing. As a result, these issues will form no part of the order to follow other than as context for the deteriorating relationship between the parties. 36. A.A. testified that as soon as she was notified of the water in the basement, she attended at the rental unit. She attempted to contact a restoration company; however, as much of Windsor had been affected by severe flooding, none were available in short order. 37. However, when she and O.A. attended at the rental unit to inspect the damage, the Tenant’s boyfriend told them not to worry about the basement and that he would take care of it. While the Tenant was reluctant to allow A.A. to enter the rental unit or to assist her with cleaning the basement, A.A. insisted on addressing the issue as soon as possible to avoid further damage. She testified that she was able to remove most of the Tenant’s property from the affected area and cleaned approximately half of the basement. 38. In her own testimony, the Tenant expressed dissatisfaction with the assistance offered by A.A. and her husband, more in relation to the speed of their efforts. As she put it, they “moved like turtles.” 39. Despite numerous hisses and gasps of derision, the Tenant did not substantively contest A.A.’s testimony that her boyfriend largely commandeered the repairs to the basement, insisting on various supplies and interfering with the efforts of the Landlord’s contractors to replace the tank. This version of events was confirmed by a letter from E.P., A.A.’s regular contractor stating that when he initially attended at the rental unit to complete the work, the Tenant’s boyfriend interfered with his efforts and insisted that he complete the work himself. To that end, the boyfriend gave A.A. a lengthy list of materials that a later electrician deemed unnecessary and serving only to waste time. 40. Unlike the issues in the kitchen, the evidence with respect to the delay in replacing the water heater includes a significant element of interference by the Tenant and her boyfriend despite the Landlord’s concerted efforts to resolve the issue. As well, particular circumstances related to the widespread flooding of basements throughout the city at the time hampered A.A.’s reasonable access to remediation that could have been more readily available at other times. 41. Putting aside the Tenant’s failure to request a remedy for the items allegedly damaged in the basement by the flood itself, she also failed to demonstrate that the Landlord could have reasonably anticipated this event. In McQuestion v. Schneider, the Ontario Court of Appeal held that liability for injuries or damages could not be imposed on a landlord who had no knowledge or could not reasonably be expected to have knowledge of a maintenance problem.[2] The Court held that then subsection 96(1) of the Landlord and Tenant Act (now subsection 20(1) of the Act): … does not impose an absolute liability upon a landlord for any injuries or damages that may be caused by a latent defect, of which the landlord has no knowledge, nor could reasonably be expected to have had such knowledge. To alter the law so drastically as to impose strict liability on a landlord, regardless of his knowledge or constructive knowledge, would require much more precise language.[3] 42. In light of the all of evidence at the hearing, I find that the extreme flooding in August, 2017 was not reasonably foreseeable. While the Tenant testified that the basement was subject to occasional wetness, on the evidence, the sheer volume of water entering the rental unit in the last days of August, 2017 was unexpected and unforeseeable. There was also no evidence that the Tenant had even notified the Landlord of the more minor moisture issues in the rental unit. As a result, I do not find that the Landlord failed to meet its maintenance obligations under subsection 20(1) of the Act with respect to the initial flooding. As a result, the Landlord cannot be held liable for the Tenant’s initial losses caused by the flood itself. 43. In Onyskiw v. CJM Property Management Ltd. the Ontario Court of Appeal rejected a long-standing presumption that a landlord may be deemed immediately in breach of subsection 20(1) of the Act once a defect arises: 58. If the legislature intended an automatic breach of the landlord’s duty to maintain and repair as soon as a service was interrupted, there would be no need for the Board to make a determination as to whether the landlord had breached its obligation. The legislation would instead simply provide that where a service has been interrupted the landlord is in breach of its duty to maintain and repair and provide that the Board “may” award a remedy under s. 30(1) which authorizes a range of remedies including an abatement of rent. 59. The tenants’ position that the landlord is automatically in breach of its statutory obligation to maintain and repair even while something is being repaired also offends the legal maximlex non cogit ad impossibilia:that the legislature does not intend compliance where, for all practical purposes, it is impossible: see Côté,The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada, at p. 479. 60. Applying general principles of statutory interpretation, I would reject the tenants’ submission that, when the RTA is properly interpreted, a landlord is automatically in breach of its obligation to repair and maintain under s. 20(1) as soon as an interruption in service occurs.[4] 44. The prior leading authority on this issue was the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in Pajelle Investments Ltd. v. Herbold.[5] However, as the Court in Onyskiw held, in light of the evolution in the law in the decades since that case was decided, Pajelle also stands for the principle that a contextual approach is necessary when considering whether the landlord responded appropriately to a maintenance defect. Such a reading is appropriate having regard to the interpretive principle that legislation enacted to regulate an activity that is ongoing over an extended period of time invites a dynamic, as opposed to a fixed, interpretation.[6] 45. This contextual approach is also consistent with the Board’s Interpretation Guideline 5, which states as follows: If a landlord has done little maintenance for an extended period, and a serious condition results that takes some time to rectify, the landlord should be responsible for the tenants’ loss of use of their unit or the common facilities during the repairs. However, if the landlord has a reasonable program of maintenance, including preventative maintenance, and is acting responsibly to rectify a problem that requires extensive repairs, an abatement of rent should not be ordered. 46. The Tenant’s Agent relied upon an earlier decision of the Landlord and Tenant Board (the ‘Board’), CET-29301-14, issued on March 26, 2013. While past decisions of the Board are not binding on me, it is worth noting that this order predates Onyskiw. In CET-29301-13, the Member relied upon the now outdated contractual analysis of Offredi v. 751768 Ontario Ltd.[7] As a result, I find that this case is of no assistance. 47. Following the analysis in Onyskiw, I find that since the Landlord demonstrated a proactive program of maintenance and acted responsibly and in a very timely manner to resolve the Tenant’s concerns and was obstructed by the unreasonable actions of the Tenant’s boyfriend, it was not in breach of its responsibilities under subsection 20(1) of the Act with respect to the water heater. Other Issues 48. The tenancy agreement was signed by the Tenant and A.A. on July 20, 2017. On the second page of the contract, the parties agreed to the following additional conditions: Landlord agrees to supply the following: Screens (2) More Cupboards and Counter top for the kitchen. 1 window already ordered for the rear bedroom. Storm door (longer) 49. Both the Tenant and A.A. signed below this addendum. The Tenant acknowledged that the Landlord has replaced one double pane window. 50. However, none of these issues, or another problem with a door, were mentioned in either application. As a result, the Tenant failed to provide the Landlord with reasonable notice that she intended to raise these issues at the hearing. Consequently, these issues will form no part of the order to follow. 51. This order contains all of the reasons in this matter and no further reasons will issue. It is ordered that: The L1 and the T6 Applications 1. Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before June 30, 2018. 2. The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,897.87*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to June 8, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit and less the amount of the abatement the Landlord owes the Tenant. 3. The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $34.52 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting June 9, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit. 4. The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application. 5. If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 30, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from July 1, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding. 6. If the unit is not vacated on or before June 30, 2018, then starting July 1, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced. 7. Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 1, 2018. 8. If, on or before June 30, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $3,965.23** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced. 9. The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if she pays the amount required under that subsection on or after July 1, 2018, but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord. The T2 Application 10. The Tenant’s application is dismissed.

(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict KM (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (the ‘L1 Application’).  The Tenant applied for an order determining that the Landlord, the Landlord’s superintendent or the Landlord’s agent withheld or deliberately interfered with the reasonable supply of a vital service, care service, or food that the Landlord is obligated to supply under the tenancy agreement (the ‘T2 Application’).  The Tenant also applied for an order determining that the Landlord failed to meet the Landlord’s maintenance obligations under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') or failed to comply with health, safety, housing or maintenance standards (the ‘T6 Application’).  These applications were heard in [CITY] on May 23, 2018. The Landlord’s Agent, AA, the Tenant, the Tenant’s Agent, GL, and the witness, BB, attended the hearing.  Preliminary Issues:  1. The Tenant’s applications are amended to remove A.A. as a party. 2. The submitted tenancy agreement indicates that the Landlord is a second mortgagee. The first mortgagee, P.B., was not served with Notice of the Hearing. However, as A.A. advised that her corporation had purchased the entirety of P.B.’s interest in the rental unit, I find no prejudice to P.B. in proceeding with the hearing in his absence. Determinations and Reasons: The L1 Application  3. The Tenant has not paid the total rent she was required to pay for the period from February 1, 2018 to May 31, 2018. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective February 17, 2018. 4. The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 5. The monthly rent is $1,050.00. 6. The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,050.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord. 7. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 22, 2017 to February 17, 2018. 8. The parties agree that the amount outstanding to May 31, 2018, inclusive of rent arrears ($4,200.00) and costs ($175.00), is $4,375.00. At the hearing, the Tenant agreed that she was four months in arrears. While she acknowledged that she wilfully withheld the rent in retaliation for the outstanding maintenance issues, she also testified that P.B. had attended at the rental unit and instructed her to pay the rent only to him, rather than A.A. in response to a financial conflict between the two mortgagees. It is unclear if P.B.’s interference was a substantial factor in the Tenant’s failure to pay the arrears as she did not pay him any portion of the outstanding balance either. 9. The Tenant supports three children on a rather limited income and has so far been unable to find alternate housing in her price range. She requested that the eviction be postponed until the end of June, 2018 to allow her children to complete their school year. On the balance of probabilities, I find that the Tenant will reasonably require additional time to either void the order for eviction or secure new accommodations. 10. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until June 30, 2018, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. The T2 Application 11. According to the Tenant’s description of this issue in the T2 Application and the evidence submitted at the hearing, the problem related to a maintenance issue with the hot water heater rather than a situation in which the Landlord or its agent withheld hot water from the Tenant or wilfully interfered with its supply. 12. As a result, I find that the Tenant should have included this issue under the T6 Application rather than under the present T2 Application. As the Act provides different remedies with regard to a maintenance application compared to a T2 Application, the forms are not interchangeable. 13. Since the Landlord received notice that the Tenant intended to raise this issue at the hearing, the matter of the hot water heater has been addressed below under the proper T6 Application. 14. Therefore, I do not find that the Landlord, the Landlord's superintendent or the Landlord's agent withheld a reasonable supply of a vital service, care service, or food that the Landlord was obligated to supply under the tenancy agreement or deliberately interfered with the reasonable supply of vital service, care service, or food. The T6 Application – Water Leaks and the Kitchen Sink 15. The Tenant testified that she discovered that the kitchen sink was leaking when she moved into the rental unit on July 21, 2017. The sink is located on a kitchen island with cabinets. She notified the Landlord of these issues on August 20, 2017 and around the same time, she also discovered a maggot infestation that appeared to originate from under the kitchen island. On or about September 14, 2017, A.A.’s husband, O.A., attended at the rental unit to investigate and conduct repairs. She stated that he removed the sink and cupboards, but promised to return the next day to complete the work. However, this did not occur. Removal of the sink did not resolve the underlying leak issue. 16. At the hearing, she submitted photographs of the flooring that had been under the moved kitchen island, showing a considerable amount of food and other debris accumulated in this area. Other images show several maggots moving along what appears to be a baseboard or some other surface in the rental unit. She recalled that these photographs were taken at some point in September, 2017. She testified that in October, 2017, she discovered the remains of a one kilogram bag of dog food under the baseboards under the island. This and other garbage wedged into the flooring apparently provided a food source for the maggots. 17. She testified that O.A. did not return for five months and the issue was only resolved when she replaced the cabinetry at her own expense. She submitted a receipt from B.B., her own contractor. This document indicated that he installed kitchen cabinets, a new countertop, sink and faucet and completed all associated electrical plumbing and electrical work. He also installed a new dishwasher. The total that B.B. charged for this work was $600.00. The receipt indicated that the Tenant had paid $125.00 of this amount as of February 22, 2018, leaving a balance of $475.00 outstanding. The Tenant testified that she ultimately paid the full balance as A.A. refused to pay on the grounds that she had not authorized the work. 18. B.B. has known the Tenant for approximately twenty years. He has approximately twelve years’ experience in carpentry and related trades. He testified that A.A. sent him to pick up a new kitchen cabinet at Habitat for Humanity (‘Habitat’) for the rental unit at some point in February, 2018 and advised him that she had a credit with that agency. When he attended at Habitat, he discovered that no such credit was on file. Habitat also had no cabinet set aside for the Landlord as she had claimed. He testified that despite an agreement with A.A., A.A. only paid $125.00 of his $600.00 invoice for the work completed in the rental unit; he confirmed that the Tenant paid the balance. He ultimately obtained the cabinets for the rental unit at Habitat, but emphasized that these were not owned or set aside by the Landlord. 19. B.B. also confirmed that the state of the Tenant’s kitchen was “deplorable” and that she was using cutlery stored in boxes for meals as there was no usable kitchen in the residence. 20. The Tenant testified that she was understandably anxious over the presence of maggots in the rental unit. 21. While she waited on repairs to her kitchen and now removed sink, the Tenant was compelled to wash her dishes in the bathroom sink and tub, as confirmed by photographs submitted at the hearing. She testified that the kitchen island and leak issues were eventually resolved in early January, 2018. 22. A.A. did not dispute the Tenant’s evidence of the leak or the ensuing maggots in the kitchen, but emphasized that she opened up the part of the floor where they were discovered and waited one day to confirm that the problem had been resolved. I agree with A.A. that there was no logic in replacing the cabinetry until the maggots had been eradicated. However, on the evidence, she appears to have taken no further steps in September, 2017 to confirm that the problem was fully resolved when the Tenant did not advise her whether or not there were still maggots in the kitchen. 23. With respect to a serious health issue such as vermin in the rental unit, I find that it was incumbent on the Landlord to take proactive measures to confirm that these pests have been fully exterminated. 24. For this reason, I find that the Landlord should have entered the rental unit to resolve this issue as soon as possible. While A.A.’s consideration of the Tenant’s privacy while her mother was hospitalized is laudable, the parties agreed that the Tenant was absent from the rental unit for much of October, 2017. During that period, the Landlord could have easily completed the necessary repairs to the kitchen island in the Tenant’s absence with minimal disruption to her enjoyment of the residence. 25. As a result, I do not find that the Landlord resolved this issue in an appropriately timely manner and therefore breached its duties under subsection 20(1) of the Act for providing and maintaining a residential complex, including the rental units in it, in a good state of repair and fit for habitation and for complying with health, safety, housing and maintenance standards. 26. As I find that the Landlord’s breach caused substantial disruption to the Tenant’s ability to normally reside in the rental unit and significantly impinged on her use and enjoyment of the residence, I find that the Tenant is entitled to an abatement of rent structured as follows: a. Loss of use of the kitchen sink from August 20, 2017 to January 1, 2018 at 15% ($697.15); b. Loss of the kitchen island from September 14, 2017 to January 31, 2018 at 5% ($237.62); c. Maggot infestation in rental unit for one month at 50% ($525.00). 27. Since neither the Tenant nor B.B. were particularly specific in their recollections of dates, I have selected the narrowest ranges of dates provided in their evidence at the hearing as the most reliable evidence. This remedy is intended to include compensation for the stress suffered by the Tenant as a result of the Landlord’s delay in restoring her kitchen. 28. While the Tenant also requested compensation for her out of pocket expenses incurred to pay B.B. for his renovation work, the evidence indicated that the Tenant was not authorized to replace the dishwasher in the rental unit and did not lead evidence to suggest that this work related to a maintenance breach properly brought to the Landlord’s attention, let alone included as a cause of action in either application. As B.B.’s invoice failed to itemize the cost of the replacement cabinetry separate from the unauthorized upgrades, it is not possible to order compensation for the eligible items alone. As a result, this compensation will not be ordered. 29. Lastly, the Tenant requested an award of $500.00 in “non-pecuniary damages” based upon the stress she endured while the Landlord’s delayed repairing the issues in the rental unit. The Tenant most likely seeks an award of general damages pursuant to paragraph (9) of subsection 30(1) of the Act. As I noted above, the ordered abatement is intended to address the emotional consequences of the Landlord’s conduct. 30. As well, the threshold for imposing general damages would require extremely egregious conduct on the part of the Landlord. The leading authority on this issue is the Ontario Divisional Court’s analysis in Mejia v. Cagini.[1] In that case, an unquestionably toxic relationship between the parties culminated in an assault upon the tenant by three friends of the landlord, in the landlord’s presence. The Ontario Rental Housing Tribunal found the assault took place in the presence of the tenant’s family and that its purpose was to put pressure upon the tenant to vacate the premises. The tenant was required to attend hospital for treatment. The Tribunal did not find that the landlord had himself committed the assault, but found that he did nothing to stop it and that he was responsible for the actions of his friends. The Tribunal found that the landlord had thereby interfered with the reasonable use and enjoyment of the apartment by the tenant and his family and awarded general damages. 31. In light of all of the circumstances, I do not find that the Landlord’s conduct in the present case rises to the level of seriousness that would warrant an order of general damages apart from the ordered abatement. The Hot Water Heater 32. The Tenant testified that whenever it rains, the basement tends to flood. She offered no other details on the amount of water in the basement or its effect on her use of the space. However, between August 28 and August 29, 2017, the Windsor area received substantial rainfall, resulting in flooding of many homes, including this rental unit. The Tenant stated that she “lost everything in the flood” and that her washer and dryer as well as the hot water heater were immersed in over one foot of water. 33. The Landlord did not replace the heater for four weeks. In the interim, the Tenant states that she was forced to wash her laundry elsewhere, taking cabs about the city. While she described this out of pocket expense as “cabs were killer,” she did not explain why she was unable to use a more economical method of public transit. Although A.A. did not contest the Tenant’s evidence that the hot water heater was not repaired for four weeks, the Tenant did not offer any explanation why her laundry could not have been washed with cold water as she did not suggest that the washing machine was disabled by the flood. Although she estimated the total cost of commuting through Windsor to attend commercial laundries at $300.00, she was unable to substantiate this estimate with any receipts or other documentation at the hearing. 34. However, the Tenant acknowledged that she waited for two or three days before notifying A.A. of the flood in her basement as she presumed that A.A. must know that the house was affected. This necessarily delayed resolution of the issue and may have caused irreparable damage to the heater that could have been prevented had the Tenant contacted A.A. more promptly. 35. While the Tenant testified about high hydro bills and the Landlord’s slow and allegedly inadequate cleaning of the basement, as these issues were not mentioned in the applications, the Tenant denied the Landlord reasonable notice that she intended to raise these issues at the hearing. As a result, these issues will form no part of the order to follow other than as context for the deteriorating relationship between the parties. 36. A.A. testified that as soon as she was notified of the water in the basement, she attended at the rental unit. She attempted to contact a restoration company; however, as much of Windsor had been affected by severe flooding, none were available in short order. 37. However, when she and O.A. attended at the rental unit to inspect the damage, the Tenant’s boyfriend told them not to worry about the basement and that he would take care of it. While the Tenant was reluctant to allow A.A. to enter the rental unit or to assist her with cleaning the basement, A.A. insisted on addressing the issue as soon as possible to avoid further damage. She testified that she was able to remove most of the Tenant’s property from the affected area and cleaned approximately half of the basement.  38. In her own testimony, the Tenant expressed dissatisfaction with the assistance offered by A.A. and her husband, more in relation to the speed of their efforts. As she put it, they “moved like turtles.” 39. Despite numerous hisses and gasps of derision, the Tenant did not substantively contest A.A.’s testimony that her boyfriend largely commandeered the repairs to the basement, insisting on various supplies and interfering with the efforts of the Landlord’s contractors to replace the tank. This version of events was confirmed by a letter from E.P., A.A.’s regular contractor stating that when he initially attended at the rental unit to complete the work, the Tenant’s boyfriend interfered with his efforts and insisted that he complete the work himself. To that end, the boyfriend gave A.A. a lengthy list of materials that a later electrician deemed unnecessary and serving only to waste time. 40. Unlike the issues in the kitchen, the evidence with respect to the delay in replacing the water heater includes a significant element of interference by the Tenant and her boyfriend despite the Landlord’s concerted efforts to resolve the issue. As well, particular circumstances related to the widespread flooding of basements throughout the city at the time hampered A.A.’s reasonable access to remediation that could have been more readily available at other times. 41. Putting aside the Tenant’s failure to request a remedy for the items allegedly damaged in the basement by the flood itself, she also failed to demonstrate that the Landlord could have reasonably anticipated this event. In McQuestion v. Schneider, the Ontario Court of Appeal held that liability for injuries or damages could not be imposed on a landlord who had no knowledge or could not reasonably be expected to have knowledge of a maintenance problem.[2] The Court held that then subsection 96(1) of the Landlord and Tenant Act (now subsection 20(1) of the Act): … does not impose an absolute liability upon a landlord for any injuries or damages that may be caused by a latent defect, of which the landlord has no knowledge, nor could reasonably be expected to have had such knowledge. To alter the law so drastically as to impose strict liability on a landlord, regardless of his knowledge or constructive knowledge, would require much more precise language.[3] 42. In light of the all of evidence at the hearing, I find that the extreme flooding in August, 2017 was not reasonably foreseeable. While the Tenant testified that the basement was subject to occasional wetness, on the evidence, the sheer volume of water entering the rental unit in the last days of August, 2017 was unexpected and unforeseeable. There was also no evidence that the Tenant had even notified the Landlord of the more minor moisture issues in the rental unit. As a result, I do not find that the Landlord failed to meet its maintenance obligations under subsection 20(1) of the Act with respect to the initial flooding. As a result, the Landlord cannot be held liable for the Tenant’s initial losses caused by the flood itself. 43. In Onyskiw v. CJM Property Management Ltd. the Ontario Court of Appeal rejected a long-standing presumption that a landlord may be deemed immediately in breach of subsection 20(1) of the Act once a defect arises: 58. If the legislature intended an automatic breach of the landlord’s duty to maintain and repair as soon as a service was interrupted, there would be no need for the Board to make a determination as to whether the landlord had breached its obligation. The legislation would instead simply provide that where a service has been interrupted the landlord is in breach of its duty to maintain and repair and provide that the Board “may” award a remedy under s. 30(1) which authorizes a range of remedies including an abatement of rent. 59. The tenants’ position that the landlord is automatically in breach of its statutory obligation to maintain and repair even while something is being repaired also offends the legal maxim lex non cogit ad impossibilia: that the legislature does not intend compliance where, for all practical purposes, it is impossible: see Côté, The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada, at p. 479. 60. Applying general principles of statutory interpretation, I would reject the tenants’ submission that, when the RTA is properly interpreted, a landlord is automatically in breach of its obligation to repair and maintain under s. 20(1) as soon as an interruption in service occurs.[4]  44. The prior leading authority on this issue was the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in Pajelle Investments Ltd. v. Herbold.[5] However, as the Court in Onyskiw held, in light of the evolution in the law in the decades since that case was decided, Pajelle also stands for the principle that a contextual approach is necessary when considering whether the landlord responded appropriately to a maintenance defect. Such a reading is appropriate having regard to the interpretive principle that legislation enacted to regulate an activity that is ongoing over an extended period of time invites a dynamic, as opposed to a fixed, interpretation.[6] 45. This contextual approach is also consistent with the Board’s Interpretation Guideline 5, which states as follows: If a landlord has done little maintenance for an extended period, and a serious condition results that takes some time to rectify, the landlord should be responsible for the tenants’ loss of use of their unit or the common facilities during the repairs. However, if the landlord has a reasonable program of maintenance, including preventative maintenance, and is acting responsibly to rectify a problem that requires extensive repairs, an abatement of rent should not be ordered. 46. The Tenant’s Agent relied upon an earlier decision of the Landlord and Tenant Board (the ‘Board’), CET-29301-14, issued on March 26, 2013. While past decisions of the Board are not binding on me, it is worth noting that this order predates Onyskiw. In CET-29301-13, the Member relied upon the now outdated contractual analysis of Offredi v. 751768 Ontario Ltd.[7] As a result, I find that this case is of no assistance. 47. Following the analysis in Onyskiw, I find that since the Landlord demonstrated a proactive program of maintenance and acted responsibly and in a very timely manner to resolve the Tenant’s concerns and was obstructed by the unreasonable actions of the Tenant’s boyfriend, it was not in breach of its responsibilities under subsection 20(1) of the Act with respect to the water heater. Other Issues 48. The tenancy agreement was signed by the Tenant and A.A. on July 20, 2017. On the second page of the contract, the parties agreed to the following additional conditions: Landlord agrees to supply the following: Screens (2) More Cupboards and Counter top for the kitchen. 1 window already ordered for the rear bedroom. Storm door (longer) 49. Both the Tenant and A.A. signed below this addendum. The Tenant acknowledged that the Landlord has replaced one double pane window. 50. However, none of these issues, or another problem with a door, were mentioned in either application. As a result, the Tenant failed to provide the Landlord with reasonable notice that she intended to raise these issues at the hearing. Consequently, these issues will form no part of the order to follow. 51. This order contains all of the reasons in this matter and no further reasons will issue. It is ordered that: The L1 and the T6 Applications   1. Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before June 30, 2018. 2. The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,897.87*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to June 8, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit and less the amount of the abatement the Landlord owes the Tenant. 3. The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $34.52 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting June 9, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit. 4. The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application. 5. If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 30, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from July 1, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding. 6. If the unit is not vacated on or before June 30, 2018, then starting July 1, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced. 7. Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 1, 2018. 8. If, on or before June 30, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $3,965.23** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced. 9. The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if she pays the amount required under that subsection on or after July 1, 2018, but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord. The T2 Application 10. The Tenant’s application is dismissed.  June 8, 2018 Date Issued Kevin Lundy Member, Landlord and Tenant Board  South West-RO 150 Dufferin Avenue, Suite 400, 4th Floor London ON N6A5N6  If you have any questions about this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.

A.C. (the 'Tenant') applied for an order
determining that M.M. (the 'Landlord') or the
Landlord's agent harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered
with the Tenant, entered the rental unit illegally, altered the locking system
on a door giving entry to the rental unit or residential complex without giving
the Tenant replacement keys, and substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex.
 
The Landlord applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant did not pay the
rent the Tenant owes, and because the Tenant has substantially interfered with
the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlord, committed an illegal act, and wilfully or negligently caused undue
damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring
the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination
date.
 
This application was
heard in Toronto on May 25, 2018.
 
The Tenant and the
Landlord attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
These applications are about
a friendly relationship that went very bad. So bad that criminal charges are
pending against the Tenant. 
2.     
The parties used to be
friends. The Tenant has lived in the Landlord’s one bedroom basement apartment
more than once. He lived there about six years ago, moved out and then moved in
again in July of 2015. 


THE ARREARS OF
RENT
3.     
The parties agree that there
was no written tenancy agreement between them but disagree as to the lawful
monthly rent charged. 
4.     
Both the Landlord and the
Tenant say that initially the monthly rent agreed to was $750.00. They also
both agree that the Tenant subsequently told the Landlord he could not afford
that amount. 
5.     
The Tenant says that they
agreed the rent would be lowered to $650.00. He further says the Landlord
agreed to “cook the books” and issue receipts for $550.00 even though the
Tenant was paying $650.00. This was because the Tenant is in receipt of social
assistance from Ontario Works (‘OW’) and his worker told him he had to have
cheaper housing. 
6.     
The Landlord says that
because the Tenant was financially struggling he agreed to accept payments
towards the rent and the Tenant would pay any shortfall when his situation
improved. They were friends so the Landlord just left the situation as it was. 
7.     
The only documentary
evidence produced by either party about the lawful monthly rent is a series of
receipts produced by the Landlord. 
8.     
Based on the receipts and
the evidence of both parties I am satisfied that the tenancy commenced July 1,
2015 and the parties agreed to a monthly rent of $750.00. 
9.     
The receipts corroborate the
evidence of both the Landlord and the Tenant in that they show for July and
August of 2015 the Landlord collected $750.00 each month plus an additional $500.00
as a last month’s rent deposit. The receipts also indicate that until February
28, 2016 the Landlord charged and collected $750.00 each month from the Tenant.

10.   The reason this is important is because s. 113
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) says the lawful rent
is the rent first charged to the Tenant subject to any discounts offered under
s. 111. 
11.   The scheme of the Act tightly regulates rent
increases and decreases. None of what the Tenant describes constitutes a legal
decrease in the rent under any of the relevant provisions of the Act nor was a
new tenancy agreement entered into. (See for example, ss. 111, and 125.)
Pursuant to s. 3 of the Act, the provisions of the Act apply despite any
agreement or waiver to the contrary. So absent a legally recognizable agreement
to decrease the rent or a new tenancy agreement, the lawful monthly rent here
has always been $750.00. 
12.   As explained further below, the Tenant was
essentially illegally evicted effective April 21, 2018. The arrears of rent and
daily compensation owing for the period ending April 21, 2018 total $5,443.84.
13.   The Landlord collected a last month’s rent
deposit from the Tenant of $500.00. Pursuant to subsection 106(10) of the Act
the deposit must be applied to the rent due for the last month of the tenancy.
14.   Interest is owing on the deposit for the period
July 1, 2015 to May 31, 2018 totalling $26.76.
15.   The Landlord incurred costs of $190.00 for
filing the application and is entitled to reimbursement of those costs.
THE TENANT’S
CLAIMS OF ILLEGAL ENTRY
16.   The relationship between the parties seems to
have gone seriously wrong as a result of events that flowed from the rental
unit having a problem with mice. 
17.   The problem with the mice seems to date back to
2016 which is a period outside of the Board’s one year limitation period (see
section 29(2)). But what the Tenant is really complaining about is what
happened on February 17, 2018.
18.   The Tenant complained to the Landlord about the
mice in his unit so the Landlord or his spouse contacted a contractor and the
Landlord told the Tenant the contractor would come in to address the issue
within 48 hours. The Tenant wanted prompter action and told the Landlord that
was unreasonable. According to the Tenant, the Landlord called him a “bitch”
and a “little wife” and the Tenant went back downstairs for a nap. 
19.   The Landlord does not specifically deny saying
these things to the Tenant. He just says the Tenant was very arrogant and being
unreasonable. 
20.   A couple of hours later the Landlord’s spouse
texted the Tenant to say the contractor would be there in 10 minutes. According
to the Tenant, the contractor then barged into his unit. The Tenant told the
contractor he had not received proper notice of entry, this was a bad time, and
asked him to leave. When the contractor expressed reluctance, the Tenant called
911 and the contractor left immediately. That was about 7 p.m. on February 17,
2018.
21.   Section 25 of the Act says a landlord can only
enter a rental unit in accordance with the Act. Section 26 details examples of
when notice is not required. In this situation none of the provisions of s. 26
apply. The mice were not an emergency despite the Tenant’s insistence that 48
hours was too long to wait, and the Tenant did not let the contractor into the
unit at the time of entry. As notice of entry was not served in accordance with
s. 27 of the Act, the entry was not in compliance with the Act. As the Landlord
is responsible for the acts of his contractors and agents, this means I am
satisfied that on February 17, 2018 the Landlord breached s. 25 of the Act. 
22.   With respect to the Landlord calling the Tenant
a “bitch” and a “little wife”, the Landlord does not deny that occurred so I am
satisfied that it did. Name calling like that is unprofessional behaviour. A
landlord is a business professional selling a vital service to a customer so
the Landlord here ought to have known that such remarks were inappropriate and
would be most unwelcome to the average tenant. In other words, the Landlord’s
remarks constitute a breach of s. 23 of the Act. 
23.   During this series of events the Landlord
actually left the City to go to the United States. He left February 17, 2018
and was away until February 23, 2018. 
24.   About three hours after the Tenant got the
contractor to leave, the Tenant went outside to smoke and found the tires of
his car slashed. He called the police and told them he believed the contractor
was responsible but the police told them there was insufficient evidence to
establish that. 
25.   That is also true for my purposes here. The
evidence is insufficient to establish it is more likely than not the contractor
slashed the Tenant’s tires. Even if I was prepared to make a finding the
contractor did it, that behaviour was clearly outside of the scope of his
authority from the Landlord. The Landlord hired the contractor to deal with the
mice issue not to slash the Tenant’s tires, so even if the contractor did do it
the evidence is insufficient to establish the Landlord should be held liable
for the contractor’s behaviour. 
26.   With respect to the Landlord’s breaches of the
Act as found above, remedy is discussed below.
THE LANDLORD’S
NOTICES OF TERMINATION 
27.   After the Tenant discovered his tires slashed he
became very angry. He blamed the Landlord for what happened. He broke into the
Landlord’s private space upstairs. He broke the bedroom door, damaged the
ceiling, and made a mess throwing plants around. 
28.   The Tenant attempted to clean up and apologised
to the Landlord. He offered to pay $100.00 for the damage. But when the
Landlord returned from the United States, the Landlord called the police. 
29.   The police came to the residential complex on or
about February 25, 2018 and interviewed the parties. By that point in time the
Landlord just wanted the Tenant to move out. He says his wife did not want to
stay there as long as the Tenant remained in the rental unit below. So the
police suggested that the Tenant could avoid criminal charges if he agreed to
move out. 
30.   As far as I can tell from the Tenant’s
testimony, he thought better of his initial agreement to this offer and called
the police station. The officers present at the house returned the Tenant’s
keys to him and he was arrested and charged with mischief. 
31.   On March 9, 2018 the Landlord served two notices
of termination on the Tenant, an N6 for illegal act pursuant to s. 61(2)(b) and
a voidable N5 pursuant to both ss. 62 and 64. 
32.   At the hearing before the Board I pointed out to
the parties that the Landlord’s application for an eviction order was
essentially moot because the parties agree that the Landlord changed the code
for the front door lock on April 21, 2018, and refused to give the Tenant the
replacement code. In other words, the Tenant was for all intents and purposes
illegally evicted on April 21, 2018. As the Tenant’s amended application seeks
an order terminating the tenancy effective April 21, 2018, an order is going to
issue terminating the tenancy on the Tenant’s application effective April 21,
2018. 
33.   In other words, it was unnecessary to hear
evidence in support of the allegations contained in the Landlord’s notices of
termination. 
THE LANDLORD’S
DAMAGE CLAIM
34.   The Landlord’s application as filed seeks
compensation of $1,300.00 for negligent or wilful damage to the residential
complex pursuant to s. 89(1) of the Act. However, the application contains no
particulars. 
35.   On the day of the hearing before the Board the
Landlord filed a request to amend his damage claim and served it on the Tenant.
The Tenant consented to the Board amending the application as requested by the
Landlord so I proceeded to hear the amended damage claim.
36.   The Landlord’s evidence establishes that he paid
his contractor $1,469.00 to repair the stucco on his bedroom ceiling, prime and
paint the room, and replace the door and lock. 
37.   The Tenant questions the reasonableness of this
amount, but led no evidence in support of the proposition that another
contractor would have charged less, or in support of the possibility the
Landlord did not in fact pay that amount to his contractor. 
38.   According to the Landlord he received a second
quote that was similar. 
39.   In the end result the Landlord’s evidence is
sufficient to establish that it is more likely than not that he paid $1,469.00
to repair the wilful damage the Tenant did to the Landlord’s bedroom and that
amount represents the reasonable cost of repair. 
40.   The second part of the Landlord’s claim is more
problematic. It claims $226.00 for cleaning out the basement and disposing of
the contents. It also claims $1,356.00 for “sanitizing” the basement, cleaning
the graffiti and priming and painting the rental unit. 
41.   Damage claims under the Act are brought pursuant
to s. 89(1) which says:
A landlord may
apply to the Board for an order requiring a tenant to pay reasonable costs that
the landlord has incurred or will incur for the repair of or, where repairing
is not reasonable, the replacement of damaged property, if the tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or a person whom the tenant permits in the
residential complex wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to the rental
unit or the residential complex and the tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.  
42.   As can be seen from this provision it is about
physical damage to the property and not cleaning or sanitizing. 
43.   More importantly perhaps, the Landlord’s
behaviour in removing the Tenant’s possessions from the rental unit was
actually an illegal act for the reasons stated below in the context of the
Tenant application. The Landlord cannot be entitled to claim against the Tenant
costs he incurred as a result of the Landlord’s own illegal behaviour.
44.   Given the above, the $226.00 claimed by the
Landlord for cleaning out the basement and disposing of the contents is denied.

45.   The Tenant does not deny that what the Landlord
calls graffiti on the walls of the rental unit is decoration the Tenant added
to the rental unit. Nor does he deny the unit needed to be painted as a result.

46.   But the Tenant says that he offered to paint the
unit himself once he removed his possessions. That was always the plan for when
the Tenant moved out prior to the disintegration of the relationship. At that
point the Landlord refused to let the Tenant do the work himself and the Tenant
never had a chance to do it anyway because of the illegal eviction. The
Landlord does not dispute this. 
47.   The Tenant and the Landlord agree that before
the Tenant moved in the Landlord paid the Tenant to paint the unit himself. The
Landlord says he paid the Tenant $1,000.00. The Tenant says he was paid
$500.00. 
48.   The reason this is important is because s. 16 of
the Act says:
When a landlord
or a tenant becomes liable to pay any amount as a result of a breach of a
tenancy agreement, the person entitled to claim the amount has a duty to take
reasonable steps to minimize the person’s losses.
49.   In this context s. 16 means the Landlord was obligated
to take reasonable steps to minimize the cost of repainting the unit. As the
Tenant had apparently done an acceptable job in exchange for good consideration
before, it is not clear to me that it was particularly reasonable for the
Landlord to refuse to let him paint it again. The is particularly true here
because if the Landlord had simply followed the process in the Act to obtain a
legal eviction order from the Board, the undisputed evidence of the Tenant
suggests the Tenant would have returned the unit to its original condition. 
50.   As a result, I am not prepared to find that the
Landlord reasonably mitigated the Tenant’s losses or that the costs the
Landlord incurred in hiring a contractor to paint the unit were reasonable. So
that part of the Landlord’s damage claim is also denied. 
MISCELLANEOUS
OTHER CLAIMS BY THE TENANT
51.   After the police became involved in February and
the Landlord started serving notices of termination in March, the Tenant filed
this application with the Board on March 23, 2018. He subsequently filed and
served a request to amend the application on April 25, 2018. As the Landlord
was properly served I granted the Tenant’s request to amend his application.
52.   What appears to have happened after the police
became involved and notices of termination served is that the parties’
relationship and behaviour deteriorated further.
53.   The Tenant says that on March 28, 2018, the Landlord
turned on the music in his part of the residential complex, turned it up very
loud, and went out. The Landlord says this was not true; he was home, it did
not happen. 
54.   As the Tenant bears the burden of proof with
respect to this allegation and the evidence of the parties is essentially equal
but opposite I find that the Tenant has led insufficient evidence to establish
the Landlord harassed him on March 28, 2018 by playing music loudly and leaving
it on while he went out. 
55.   The Tenant says the Landlord did this a second
time on March 29, 2018. So the Tenant turned off the electricity to stop the
noise. That caused a malfunction in an alarm in the basement triggering an
annoying intermittent beeping. When the beeping did not stop the Tenant told
the Landlord he could not live like that. The Tenant says the Landlord told him
it was his own fault and flipped him the middle finger. 
56.   The Landlord acknowledges the Tenant turned off
the electricity because the Landlord was playing music. He did not dispute the
Tenant’s evidence that the Landlord told him it was his fault nor does the
Landlord deny flipping him the middle finger. 
57.   There can be no excuse for a landlord “flipping
the finger” at a tenant. Any reasonable landlord knows or ought to know that
such behaviour is unprofessional and would be unwelcome to any reasonable
tenant. So I am satisfied that in doing so the Landlord breached s. 23 of the
Act. 
58.   Because of the beeping the Tenant rented
alternative accommodation and stayed there from March 29, 2018 to April 22,
2018. He paid $685.00 for that alternative accommodation. 
59.   Although I would agree with the Landlord that
the Tenant is partially responsible for the annoying beeping because he turned
off the electricity, I am satisfied that the Tenant did so because of the
Landlord’s behaviour in playing loud music. That being said, the reasonable
thing the Tenant should have done, but did not, was ask the Landlord to turn
the music down. 
60.   Given all of the above, I do not believe the
Landlord can be held financially responsible for the disturbance caused by the
beeping. The Tenant is not entitled to an order for $685.00 for the place he
stayed in from March 29, 2018 to April 22, 2018. 
61.   During this period the Tenant went back and
forth to the rental unit.
62.   He says that on April 3, 2018 he noticed $150.00
was missing from his coffee table indicating someone was in his unit. The Landlord
says “why would I take the Tenant’s money?” which I took to mean the Landlord
denies entering the rental unit or stealing money from the Tenant. 
63.   The evidence with respect to this money and the
alleged illegal entry is simply insufficient to meet the Tenant’s burden of
proof. He may have had money go missing; but he may not have. So that part of
the Tenant’s application must also be dismissed. 
64.   On April 17, 2018 the beeping noise was
repaired. 
THE CHANGING
OF THE LOCKS
65.   On April 21, 2018 the Tenant discovered the key
pad code to the front door had been changed but he was able to get into the
residential complex because the cleaner was there. The Tenant says when he
asked the Landlord for the new code, the Landlord refused so the Tenant
threatened to turn the power off again. The Tenant says the Landlord was in his
face yelling at that point so the Tenant called 911 again. 
66.   The Landlord confirms he refused to give the
Tenant the new code because the Tenant had not paid rent for the month of
April, 2018. 
67.   Section 24 of the Act says:
A landlord
shall not alter the locking system on a door giving entry to a rental unit or
residential complex or cause the locking system to be altered during the
tenant’s occupancy of the rental unit without giving the tenant replacement
keys.  
68.   By changing the key pad code and refusing to
give him the new one the Landlord breached s. 24 of the Act. Remedy with
respect to this breach is discussed below. 
69.   According to the Tenant, when the police arrived
they told him that nothing was in writing so he had to leave. The Tenant was
given four hours to remove all of his possessions which was not sufficient
time. He also says the Landlord refused to let him access his stored
possessions in the garage.
70.   The Landlord confirms the police gave the Tenant
four hours to remove his possessions but says the Landlord offered him more
time. According to the Landlord the Tenant returned on April 30, 2018 to remove
more of his possessions but the stuff left in the unit downstairs after that was
garbage. So the Landlord put it out in bags and the Tenant did not come to
retrieve it. However, the Landlord admits that he told the Tenant he would not
let the Tenant access possessions in the garage unless the Tenant cleaned out
the rental unit first.
71.   I would note at this point that the police had
no right to tell the Tenant he had four hours to collect his possessions and
leave. Subsection 168(2) of the Act says:
The Board has
exclusive jurisdiction to determine all applications under this Act and with
respect to all matters in which jurisdiction is conferred on it by this Act.  
72.   Moreover, s. 37(1) says:
A tenancy may
be terminated only in accordance with this Act.  
73.   This means that only the Board had the authority
to tell the Tenant when and if he had to move out. 
74.   At that point in time the Landlord had filed an
application with the Board for eviction but that application had not been
heard. Even if the Landlord had obtained an eviction order, the Board’s orders
cannot be enforced by a landlord or by the police; they are enforceable only
through the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) as they are the legal equivalent
of writs of possession. The Sheriff gives tenants notice as to when they are
coming and a tenant has 72 hours after a legal eviction to recover his or her
possessions. 
75.   Further, the Tenant here had clearly not
abandoned the unit. His possessions were there. He was returning to the unit on
a regular basis. 
76.   So what happened to the Tenant on April 21, 2018
was also an illegal eviction. By putting the Tenant out of possession, clearing
out the unit of the Tenant’s remaining items, and refusing the Tenant’s request
to recover his possessions in the garage, the Landlord breached sections 22 and
23 of the Act. Again, remedy is discussed further below.  
77.   On May 3, 2018 the Landlord put the Tenant’s
remaining possessions out on the curb and sent the Tenant a text showing the
Tenant the bags sitting outside. 
78.   The Tenant says he found a new place to live and
was able to get possession of his new rental unit on April 22, 2018. 
REMEDIES FOR
THE LANDLORD’S BREACHES
79.   The Tenant’s application seeks: abatement of the
rent; a cease and desist order; compensation for out of pocket expenses; an
administrative fine; and termination of the tenancy. 
80.   The request for a cease and desist order is with
respect to the illegal entry and is no longer relevant as the Tenant no longer
lives in the rental unit. 
81.   However, the amended application also seeks an
order requiring the Landlord to return to the Tenant any of his possessions still
in the garage. The Tenant is entitled to such an order. 
82.   The request for compensation for out of pocket
expenses is for rat poison, traps and door “scrapes”. No evidence was led in
support of these claims but even if it had been they would have been denied. As
I stated at the hearing, this application is not based on the rights and
obligations set out in s. 20(1) of the Act. The breaches by the Landlord of the
Act as set out above, are not connected to these claims so they are denied
accordingly. 
83.   In the amended application the Tenant seeks
$500.00 for moving costs plus the cost of staying elsewhere for the period
March 29, 2018 and April 22, 2018. No evidence was led that the Tenant incurred
moving expenses and for the reasons already stated above, the Tenant is not
entitled to a remedy for the cost of staying elsewhere due to the beeping. 
84.   As stated above, the tenancy shall be terminated
effective April 21, 2018. The Landlord’s behaviour in changing the locks and
illegally evicting the Tenant justifies such an order. 
85.   That leaves the claims for abatement and an
administrative fine. 
86.   Abatement of the rent is a contractual remedy
entitled to reflect the idea that the Tenant is paying for a bundle of goods
and services and if the Tenant is not receiving those goods and services the
rent should be abated proportional to the difference between what is being paid
for and what is being received. 
87.   The Tenant here is clearly entitled to abatement
of the rent.  
88.   With respect to the illegal entry by the
Landlord’s contractor on February 17, 2018, although the entry was illegal and
the Tenant was entitled to notice of a specific date and time at least 24 hours
in advance, one of the reasons the Tenant did not receive proper notice is
because he insisted the mice problem be addressed quickly. The 48 hours’ notice
he was given was not quick enough. So it seems to me to be somewhat
unreasonable to award the Tenant any significant abatement for the entry as the
Landlord was simply trying to acquiesce to the Tenant’s demands. As a result,
only a minimal abatement is warranted which I fix at $50.00. 
89.   With respect to the name calling on February 17,
2018, and the Landlord flipping the Tenant the finger on March 29, 2018,
abatement of the rent is justified. The Tenant led little evidence as to how
these events impacted him but he does say he felt belittled and depressed.
Given all of the evidence before me and my knowledge of similar like cases
before the Board, it seems to me that a reasonable abatement of the rent for
these two breaches would be $200.00 each for a total of $400.00. 
90.   With respect to the changing of the locks, the
disposal of the Tenant’s possessions, the refusal to let the Tenant access the
garage, and the illegal eviction, I believe a reasonable abatement of the rent
would be two month’s rent or $1,600.00. I say this based on similar like cases
before the Board and because even though the Tenant found another place to live
the day following the illegal eviction, the sequence of events described above
was clearly distressing to the Tenant.
91.   The final request in the amended application is
for an administrative fine. 
92.   With respect to the request for an
administrative fine the Board’s Interpretation Guideline # 16 on Administrative
Fines says:
An
administrative fine is a remedy to be used by the Board to encourage compliance
with the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “RTA”), and to deter
landlords from engaging in similar activity in the future. This remedy is not
normally imposed unless a landlord has shown a blatant disregard for the RTA
and other remedies will not provide adequate deterrence and compliance. 
93.   The Landlord here has clearly shown a blatant
disregard for the Act. Changing the locks, illegal evicting the Tenant, and
refusing to give him access to his possessions all demonstrate an utter
disregard for the Tenant’s rights and the law. 
94.   In terms of quantum for the fine, the remedies
granted above to the Tenant are relatively minor. Further, the nature of the
behaviour in question is such that a substantial fine is warranted. Given all
of the above, and my knowledge of similar like circumstances I am satisfied an
administrative fine of $5,000.00 is warranted. An order shall issue
accordingly. 
95.   This order contains all of the reasons for the
decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.
It is ordered that:
1.     
On or before August 15,
2018, the Landlord shall deliver to the Tenant any of the Tenant’s possessions
still in the Landlord’s control and give the Tenant access to the garage at the
residential complex on a date and time of the Tenant’s choosing. 
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $4,336.08. This amount represents rent arrears and daily compensation
owing up to April 21, 2018, plus compensation for undue damage to the
residential complex caused by the Tenant’s wilful or negligent behaviour, less
the Tenant’s last month’s rent deposit and interest owing on the deposit and
the amount the Landlord owes the Tenant for abatements of the rent. 
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
4.     
The total amount the Tenant
owes the Landlord under this order is $4,526.08.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing by August 3, 2018, the Tenant will owe
interest. This will be simple interest calculated from August 4, 2018 at 3.00%
annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
The Landlord shall pay
$5,000.00 to the Board as an administrative fine on or before August 31, 2018.

Tenancies Act, 2006

Numbers: TET-89650-18
TEL-90138-18
A.C. (the 'Tenant') applied for an order
determining that M.M. (the 'Landlord') or the
Landlord's agent harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered
with the Tenant, entered the rental unit illegally, altered the locking system
on a door giving entry to the rental unit or residential complex without giving
the Tenant replacement keys, and substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex.
The Landlord applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant did not pay the
rent the Tenant owes, and because the Tenant has substantially interfered with
the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlord, committed an illegal act, and wilfully or negligently caused undue
damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring
the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination
date.
This application was
heard in Toronto on May 25, 2018.
The Tenant and the
Landlord attended the hearing.
Determinations:
1.
These applications are about
a friendly relationship that went very bad. So bad that criminal charges are
pending against the Tenant.
2.
The parties used to be
friends. The Tenant has lived in the Landlord’s one bedroom basement apartment
more than once. He lived there about six years ago, moved out and then moved in
again in July of 2015.
THE ARREARS OF
RENT
3.
The parties agree that there
was no written tenancy agreement between them but disagree as to the lawful
monthly rent charged.
4.
Both the Landlord and the
Tenant say that initially the monthly rent agreed to was $750.00. They also
both agree that the Tenant subsequently told the Landlord he could not afford
that amount.
5.
The Tenant says that they
agreed the rent would be lowered to $650.00. He further says the Landlord
agreed to “cook the books” and issue receipts for $550.00 even though the
Tenant was paying $650.00. This was because the Tenant is in receipt of social
assistance from Ontario Works (‘OW’) and his worker told him he had to have
cheaper housing.
6.
The Landlord says that
because the Tenant was financially struggling he agreed to accept payments
towards the rent and the Tenant would pay any shortfall when his situation
improved. They were friends so the Landlord just left the situation as it was.
7.
The only documentary
evidence produced by either party about the lawful monthly rent is a series of
receipts produced by the Landlord.
8.
Based on the receipts and
the evidence of both parties I am satisfied that the tenancy commenced July 1,
2015 and the parties agreed to a monthly rent of $750.00.
9.
The receipts corroborate the
evidence of both the Landlord and the Tenant in that they show for July and
August of 2015 the Landlord collected $750.00 each month plus an additional $500.00
as a last month’s rent deposit. The receipts also indicate that until February
28, 2016 the Landlord charged and collected $750.00 each month from the Tenant.
10. The reason this is important is because s. 113
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) says the lawful rent
is the rent first charged to the Tenant subject to any discounts offered under
s. 111.
11. The scheme of the Act tightly regulates rent
increases and decreases. None of what the Tenant describes constitutes a legal
decrease in the rent under any of the relevant provisions of the Act nor was a
new tenancy agreement entered into. (See for example, ss. 111, and 125.)
Pursuant to s. 3 of the Act, the provisions of the Act apply despite any
agreement or waiver to the contrary. So absent a legally recognizable agreement
to decrease the rent or a new tenancy agreement, the lawful monthly rent here
has always been $750.00.
12. As explained further below, the Tenant was
essentially illegally evicted effective April 21, 2018. The arrears of rent and
daily compensation owing for the period ending April 21, 2018 total $5,443.84.
13. The Landlord collected a last month’s rent
deposit from the Tenant of $500.00. Pursuant to subsection 106(10) of the Act
the deposit must be applied to the rent due for the last month of the tenancy.
14. Interest is owing on the deposit for the period
July 1, 2015 to May 31, 2018 totalling $26.76.
15. The Landlord incurred costs of $190.00 for
filing the application and is entitled to reimbursement of those costs.
THE TENANT’S
CLAIMS OF ILLEGAL ENTRY
16. The relationship between the parties seems to
have gone seriously wrong as a result of events that flowed from the rental
unit having a problem with mice.
17. The problem with the mice seems to date back to
2016 which is a period outside of the Board’s one year limitation period (see
section 29(2)). But what the Tenant is really complaining about is what
happened on February 17, 2018.
18. The Tenant complained to the Landlord about the
mice in his unit so the Landlord or his spouse contacted a contractor and the
Landlord told the Tenant the contractor would come in to address the issue
within 48 hours. The Tenant wanted prompter action and told the Landlord that
was unreasonable. According to the Tenant, the Landlord called him a “bitch”
and a “little wife” and the Tenant went back downstairs for a nap.
19. The Landlord does not specifically deny saying
these things to the Tenant. He just says the Tenant was very arrogant and being
unreasonable.
20. A couple of hours later the Landlord’s spouse
texted the Tenant to say the contractor would be there in 10 minutes. According
to the Tenant, the contractor then barged into his unit. The Tenant told the
contractor he had not received proper notice of entry, this was a bad time, and
asked him to leave. When the contractor expressed reluctance, the Tenant called
911 and the contractor left immediately. That was about 7 p.m. on February 17,
2018.
21. Section 25 of the Act says a landlord can only
enter a rental unit in accordance with the Act. Section 26 details examples of
when notice is not required. In this situation none of the provisions of s. 26
apply. The mice were not an emergency despite the Tenant’s insistence that 48
hours was too long to wait, and the Tenant did not let the contractor into the
unit at the time of entry. As notice of entry was not served in accordance with
s. 27 of the Act, the entry was not in compliance with the Act. As the Landlord
is responsible for the acts of his contractors and agents, this means I am
satisfied that on February 17, 2018 the Landlord breached s. 25 of the Act.
22. With respect to the Landlord calling the Tenant
a “bitch” and a “little wife”, the Landlord does not deny that occurred so I am
satisfied that it did. Name calling like that is unprofessional behaviour. A
landlord is a business professional selling a vital service to a customer so
the Landlord here ought to have known that such remarks were inappropriate and
would be most unwelcome to the average tenant. In other words, the Landlord’s
remarks constitute a breach of s. 23 of the Act.
23. During this series of events the Landlord
actually left the City to go to the United States. He left February 17, 2018
and was away until February 23, 2018.
24. About three hours after the Tenant got the
contractor to leave, the Tenant went outside to smoke and found the tires of
his car slashed. He called the police and told them he believed the contractor
was responsible but the police told them there was insufficient evidence to
establish that.
25. That is also true for my purposes here. The
evidence is insufficient to establish it is more likely than not the contractor
slashed the Tenant’s tires. Even if I was prepared to make a finding the
contractor did it, that behaviour was clearly outside of the scope of his
authority from the Landlord. The Landlord hired the contractor to deal with the
mice issue not to slash the Tenant’s tires, so even if the contractor did do it
the evidence is insufficient to establish the Landlord should be held liable
for the contractor’s behaviour.
26. With respect to the Landlord’s breaches of the
Act as found above, remedy is discussed below.
THE LANDLORD’S
NOTICES OF TERMINATION
27. After the Tenant discovered his tires slashed he
became very angry. He blamed the Landlord for what happened. He broke into the
Landlord’s private space upstairs. He broke the bedroom door, damaged the
ceiling, and made a mess throwing plants around.
28. The Tenant attempted to clean up and apologised
to the Landlord. He offered to pay $100.00 for the damage. But when the
Landlord returned from the United States, the Landlord called the police.
29. The police came to the residential complex on or
about February 25, 2018 and interviewed the parties. By that point in time the
Landlord just wanted the Tenant to move out. He says his wife did not want to
stay there as long as the Tenant remained in the rental unit below. So the
police suggested that the Tenant could avoid criminal charges if he agreed to
move out.
30. As far as I can tell from the Tenant’s
testimony, he thought better of his initial agreement to this offer and called
the police station. The officers present at the house returned the Tenant’s
keys to him and he was arrested and charged with mischief.
31. On March 9, 2018 the Landlord served two notices
of termination on the Tenant, an N6 for illegal act pursuant to s. 61(2)(b) and
a voidable N5 pursuant to both ss. 62 and 64.
32. At the hearing before the Board I pointed out to
the parties that the Landlord’s application for an eviction order was
essentially moot because the parties agree that the Landlord changed the code
for the front door lock on April 21, 2018, and refused to give the Tenant the
replacement code. In other words, the Tenant was for all intents and purposes
illegally evicted on April 21, 2018. As the Tenant’s amended application seeks
an order terminating the tenancy effective April 21, 2018, an order is going to
issue terminating the tenancy on the Tenant’s application effective April 21,
2018.
33. In other words, it was unnecessary to hear
evidence in support of the allegations contained in the Landlord’s notices of
termination.
THE LANDLORD’S
DAMAGE CLAIM
34. The Landlord’s application as filed seeks
compensation of $1,300.00 for negligent or wilful damage to the residential
complex pursuant to s. 89(1) of the Act. However, the application contains no
particulars.
35. On the day of the hearing before the Board the
Landlord filed a request to amend his damage claim and served it on the Tenant.
The Tenant consented to the Board amending the application as requested by the
Landlord so I proceeded to hear the amended damage claim.
36. The Landlord’s evidence establishes that he paid
his contractor $1,469.00 to repair the stucco on his bedroom ceiling, prime and
paint the room, and replace the door and lock.
37. The Tenant questions the reasonableness of this
amount, but led no evidence in support of the proposition that another
contractor would have charged less, or in support of the possibility the
Landlord did not in fact pay that amount to his contractor.
38. According to the Landlord he received a second
quote that was similar.
39. In the end result the Landlord’s evidence is
sufficient to establish that it is more likely than not that he paid $1,469.00
to repair the wilful damage the Tenant did to the Landlord’s bedroom and that
amount represents the reasonable cost of repair.
40. The second part of the Landlord’s claim is more
problematic. It claims $226.00 for cleaning out the basement and disposing of
the contents. It also claims $1,356.00 for “sanitizing” the basement, cleaning
the graffiti and priming and painting the rental unit.
41. Damage claims under the Act are brought pursuant
to s. 89(1) which says:
A landlord may
apply to the Board for an order requiring a tenant to pay reasonable costs that
the landlord has incurred or will incur for the repair of or, where repairing
is not reasonable, the replacement of damaged property, if the tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or a person whom the tenant permits in the
residential complex wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to the rental
unit or the residential complex and the tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
42. As can be seen from this provision it is about
physical damage to the property and not cleaning or sanitizing.
43. More importantly perhaps, the Landlord’s
behaviour in removing the Tenant’s possessions from the rental unit was
actually an illegal act for the reasons stated below in the context of the
Tenant application. The Landlord cannot be entitled to claim against the Tenant
costs he incurred as a result of the Landlord’s own illegal behaviour.
44. Given the above, the $226.00 claimed by the
Landlord for cleaning out the basement and disposing of the contents is denied.
45. The Tenant does not deny that what the Landlord
calls graffiti on the walls of the rental unit is decoration the Tenant added
to the rental unit. Nor does he deny the unit needed to be painted as a result.
46. But the Tenant says that he offered to paint the
unit himself once he removed his possessions. That was always the plan for when
the Tenant moved out prior to the disintegration of the relationship. At that
point the Landlord refused to let the Tenant do the work himself and the Tenant
never had a chance to do it anyway because of the illegal eviction. The
Landlord does not dispute this.
47. The Tenant and the Landlord agree that before
the Tenant moved in the Landlord paid the Tenant to paint the unit himself. The
Landlord says he paid the Tenant $1,000.00. The Tenant says he was paid
$500.00.
48. The reason this is important is because s. 16 of
the Act says:
When a landlord
or a tenant becomes liable to pay any amount as a result of a breach of a
tenancy agreement, the person entitled to claim the amount has a duty to take
reasonable steps to minimize the person’s losses.
49. In this context s. 16 means the Landlord was obligated
to take reasonable steps to minimize the cost of repainting the unit. As the
Tenant had apparently done an acceptable job in exchange for good consideration
before, it is not clear to me that it was particularly reasonable for the
Landlord to refuse to let him paint it again. The is particularly true here
because if the Landlord had simply followed the process in the Act to obtain a
legal eviction order from the Board, the undisputed evidence of the Tenant
suggests the Tenant would have returned the unit to its original condition.
50. As a result, I am not prepared to find that the
Landlord reasonably mitigated the Tenant’s losses or that the costs the
Landlord incurred in hiring a contractor to paint the unit were reasonable. So
that part of the Landlord’s damage claim is also denied.
MISCELLANEOUS
OTHER CLAIMS BY THE TENANT
51. After the police became involved in February and
the Landlord started serving notices of termination in March, the Tenant filed
this application with the Board on March 23, 2018. He subsequently filed and
served a request to amend the application on April 25, 2018. As the Landlord
was properly served I granted the Tenant’s request to amend his application.
52. What appears to have happened after the police
became involved and notices of termination served is that the parties’
relationship and behaviour deteriorated further.
53. The Tenant says that on March 28, 2018, the Landlord
turned on the music in his part of the residential complex, turned it up very
loud, and went out. The Landlord says this was not true; he was home, it did
not happen.
54. As the Tenant bears the burden of proof with
respect to this allegation and the evidence of the parties is essentially equal
but opposite I find that the Tenant has led insufficient evidence to establish
the Landlord harassed him on March 28, 2018 by playing music loudly and leaving
it on while he went out.
55. The Tenant says the Landlord did this a second
time on March 29, 2018. So the Tenant turned off the electricity to stop the
noise. That caused a malfunction in an alarm in the basement triggering an
annoying intermittent beeping. When the beeping did not stop the Tenant told
the Landlord he could not live like that. The Tenant says the Landlord told him
it was his own fault and flipped him the middle finger.
56. The Landlord acknowledges the Tenant turned off
the electricity because the Landlord was playing music. He did not dispute the
Tenant’s evidence that the Landlord told him it was his fault nor does the
Landlord deny flipping him the middle finger.
57. There can be no excuse for a landlord “flipping
the finger” at a tenant. Any reasonable landlord knows or ought to know that
such behaviour is unprofessional and would be unwelcome to any reasonable
tenant. So I am satisfied that in doing so the Landlord breached s. 23 of the
Act.
58. Because of the beeping the Tenant rented
alternative accommodation and stayed there from March 29, 2018 to April 22,
2018. He paid $685.00 for that alternative accommodation.
59. Although I would agree with the Landlord that
the Tenant is partially responsible for the annoying beeping because he turned
off the electricity, I am satisfied that the Tenant did so because of the
Landlord’s behaviour in playing loud music. That being said, the reasonable
thing the Tenant should have done, but did not, was ask the Landlord to turn
the music down.
60. Given all of the above, I do not believe the
Landlord can be held financially responsible for the disturbance caused by the
beeping. The Tenant is not entitled to an order for $685.00 for the place he
stayed in from March 29, 2018 to April 22, 2018.
61. During this period the Tenant went back and
forth to the rental unit.
62. He says that on April 3, 2018 he noticed $150.00
was missing from his coffee table indicating someone was in his unit. The Landlord
says “why would I take the Tenant’s money?” which I took to mean the Landlord
denies entering the rental unit or stealing money from the Tenant.
63. The evidence with respect to this money and the
alleged illegal entry is simply insufficient to meet the Tenant’s burden of
proof. He may have had money go missing; but he may not have. So that part of
the Tenant’s application must also be dismissed.
64. On April 17, 2018 the beeping noise was
repaired.
THE CHANGING
OF THE LOCKS
65. On April 21, 2018 the Tenant discovered the key
pad code to the front door had been changed but he was able to get into the
residential complex because the cleaner was there. The Tenant says when he
asked the Landlord for the new code, the Landlord refused so the Tenant
threatened to turn the power off again. The Tenant says the Landlord was in his
face yelling at that point so the Tenant called 911 again.
66. The Landlord confirms he refused to give the
Tenant the new code because the Tenant had not paid rent for the month of
April, 2018.
67. Section 24 of the Act says:
A landlord
shall not alter the locking system on a door giving entry to a rental unit or
residential complex or cause the locking system to be altered during the
tenant’s occupancy of the rental unit without giving the tenant replacement
keys.
68. By changing the key pad code and refusing to
give him the new one the Landlord breached s. 24 of the Act. Remedy with
respect to this breach is discussed below.
69. According to the Tenant, when the police arrived
they told him that nothing was in writing so he had to leave. The Tenant was
given four hours to remove all of his possessions which was not sufficient
time. He also says the Landlord refused to let him access his stored
possessions in the garage.
70. The Landlord confirms the police gave the Tenant
four hours to remove his possessions but says the Landlord offered him more
time. According to the Landlord the Tenant returned on April 30, 2018 to remove
more of his possessions but the stuff left in the unit downstairs after that was
garbage. So the Landlord put it out in bags and the Tenant did not come to
retrieve it. However, the Landlord admits that he told the Tenant he would not
let the Tenant access possessions in the garage unless the Tenant cleaned out
the rental unit first.
71. I would note at this point that the police had
no right to tell the Tenant he had four hours to collect his possessions and
leave. Subsection 168(2) of the Act says:
The Board has
exclusive jurisdiction to determine all applications under this Act and with
respect to all matters in which jurisdiction is conferred on it by this Act.
72. Moreover, s. 37(1) says:
A tenancy may
be terminated only in accordance with this Act.
73. This means that only the Board had the authority
to tell the Tenant when and if he had to move out.
74. At that point in time the Landlord had filed an
application with the Board for eviction but that application had not been
heard. Even if the Landlord had obtained an eviction order, the Board’s orders
cannot be enforced by a landlord or by the police; they are enforceable only
through the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) as they are the legal equivalent
of writs of possession. The Sheriff gives tenants notice as to when they are
coming and a tenant has 72 hours after a legal eviction to recover his or her
possessions.
75. Further, the Tenant here had clearly not
abandoned the unit. His possessions were there. He was returning to the unit on
a regular basis.
76. So what happened to the Tenant on April 21, 2018
was also an illegal eviction. By putting the Tenant out of possession, clearing
out the unit of the Tenant’s remaining items, and refusing the Tenant’s request
to recover his possessions in the garage, the Landlord breached sections 22 and
23 of the Act. Again, remedy is discussed further below.
77. On May 3, 2018 the Landlord put the Tenant’s
remaining possessions out on the curb and sent the Tenant a text showing the
Tenant the bags sitting outside.
78. The Tenant says he found a new place to live and
was able to get possession of his new rental unit on April 22, 2018.
REMEDIES FOR
THE LANDLORD’S BREACHES
79. The Tenant’s application seeks: abatement of the
rent; a cease and desist order; compensation for out of pocket expenses; an
administrative fine; and termination of the tenancy.
80. The request for a cease and desist order is with
respect to the illegal entry and is no longer relevant as the Tenant no longer
lives in the rental unit.
81. However, the amended application also seeks an
order requiring the Landlord to return to the Tenant any of his possessions still
in the garage. The Tenant is entitled to such an order.
82. The request for compensation for out of pocket
expenses is for rat poison, traps and door “scrapes”. No evidence was led in
support of these claims but even if it had been they would have been denied. As
I stated at the hearing, this application is not based on the rights and
obligations set out in s. 20(1) of the Act. The breaches by the Landlord of the
Act as set out above, are not connected to these claims so they are denied
accordingly.
83. In the amended application the Tenant seeks
$500.00 for moving costs plus the cost of staying elsewhere for the period
March 29, 2018 and April 22, 2018. No evidence was led that the Tenant incurred
moving expenses and for the reasons already stated above, the Tenant is not
entitled to a remedy for the cost of staying elsewhere due to the beeping.
84. As stated above, the tenancy shall be terminated
effective April 21, 2018. The Landlord’s behaviour in changing the locks and
illegally evicting the Tenant justifies such an order.
85. That leaves the claims for abatement and an
administrative fine.
86. Abatement of the rent is a contractual remedy
entitled to reflect the idea that the Tenant is paying for a bundle of goods
and services and if the Tenant is not receiving those goods and services the
rent should be abated proportional to the difference between what is being paid
for and what is being received.
87. The Tenant here is clearly entitled to abatement
of the rent.
88. With respect to the illegal entry by the
Landlord’s contractor on February 17, 2018, although the entry was illegal and
the Tenant was entitled to notice of a specific date and time at least 24 hours
in advance, one of the reasons the Tenant did not receive proper notice is
because he insisted the mice problem be addressed quickly. The 48 hours’ notice
he was given was not quick enough. So it seems to me to be somewhat
unreasonable to award the Tenant any significant abatement for the entry as the
Landlord was simply trying to acquiesce to the Tenant’s demands. As a result,
only a minimal abatement is warranted which I fix at $50.00.
89. With respect to the name calling on February 17,
2018, and the Landlord flipping the Tenant the finger on March 29, 2018,
abatement of the rent is justified. The Tenant led little evidence as to how
these events impacted him but he does say he felt belittled and depressed.
Given all of the evidence before me and my knowledge of similar like cases
before the Board, it seems to me that a reasonable abatement of the rent for
these two breaches would be $200.00 each for a total of $400.00.
90. With respect to the changing of the locks, the
disposal of the Tenant’s possessions, the refusal to let the Tenant access the
garage, and the illegal eviction, I believe a reasonable abatement of the rent
would be two month’s rent or $1,600.00. I say this based on similar like cases
before the Board and because even though the Tenant found another place to live
the day following the illegal eviction, the sequence of events described above
was clearly distressing to the Tenant.
91. The final request in the amended application is
for an administrative fine.
92. With respect to the request for an
administrative fine the Board’s Interpretation Guideline # 16 on Administrative
Fines says:
An
administrative fine is a remedy to be used by the Board to encourage compliance
with the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “RTA”), and to deter
landlords from engaging in similar activity in the future. This remedy is not
normally imposed unless a landlord has shown a blatant disregard for the RTA
and other remedies will not provide adequate deterrence and compliance.
93. The Landlord here has clearly shown a blatant
disregard for the Act. Changing the locks, illegal evicting the Tenant, and
refusing to give him access to his possessions all demonstrate an utter
disregard for the Tenant’s rights and the law.
94. In terms of quantum for the fine, the remedies
granted above to the Tenant are relatively minor. Further, the nature of the
behaviour in question is such that a substantial fine is warranted. Given all
of the above, and my knowledge of similar like circumstances I am satisfied an
administrative fine of $5,000.00 is warranted. An order shall issue
accordingly.
95. This order contains all of the reasons for the
decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.
It is ordered that:
1.
On or before August 15,
2018, the Landlord shall deliver to the Tenant any of the Tenant’s possessions
still in the Landlord’s control and give the Tenant access to the garage at the
residential complex on a date and time of the Tenant’s choosing.
2.
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $4,336.08. This amount represents rent arrears and daily compensation
owing up to April 21, 2018, plus compensation for undue damage to the
residential complex caused by the Tenant’s wilful or negligent behaviour, less
the Tenant’s last month’s rent deposit and interest owing on the deposit and
the amount the Landlord owes the Tenant for abatements of the rent.
3.
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
4.
The total amount the Tenant
owes the Landlord under this order is $4,526.08.
5.
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing by August 3, 2018, the Tenant will owe
interest. This will be simple interest calculated from August 4, 2018 at 3.00%
annually on the balance outstanding.
6.
The Landlord shall pay
$5,000.00 to the Board as an administrative fine on or before August 31, 2018.

(the 'Tenant') applied for an order determining that M.M. (the 'Landlord') or the Landlord's agent harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with the Tenant, entered the rental unit illegally, altered the locking system on a door giving entry to the rental unit or residential complex without giving the Tenant replacement keys, and substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex. The Landlord applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant did not pay the rent the Tenant owes, and because the Tenant has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord, committed an illegal act, and wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date. This application was heard in Toronto on May 25, 2018. The Tenant and the Landlord attended the hearing. Determinations: 1. These applications are about a friendly relationship that went very bad. So bad that criminal charges are pending against the Tenant. 2. The parties used to be friends. The Tenant has lived in the Landlord’s one bedroom basement apartment more than once. He lived there about six years ago, moved out and then moved in again in July of 2015. THE ARREARS OF RENT 3. The parties agree that there was no written tenancy agreement between them but disagree as to the lawful monthly rent charged. 4. Both the Landlord and the Tenant say that initially the monthly rent agreed to was $750.00. They also both agree that the Tenant subsequently told the Landlord he could not afford that amount. 5. The Tenant says that they agreed the rent would be lowered to $650.00. He further says the Landlord agreed to “cook the books” and issue receipts for $550.00 even though the Tenant was paying $650.00. This was because the Tenant is in receipt of social assistance from Ontario Works (‘OW’) and his worker told him he had to have cheaper housing. 6. The Landlord says that because the Tenant was financially struggling he agreed to accept payments towards the rent and the Tenant would pay any shortfall when his situation improved. They were friends so the Landlord just left the situation as it was. 7. The only documentary evidence produced by either party about the lawful monthly rent is a series of receipts produced by the Landlord. 8. Based on the receipts and the evidence of both parties I am satisfied that the tenancy commenced July 1, 2015 and the parties agreed to a monthly rent of $750.00. 9. The receipts corroborate the evidence of both the Landlord and the Tenant in that they show for July and August of 2015 the Landlord collected $750.00 each month plus an additional $500.00 as a last month’s rent deposit. The receipts also indicate that until February 28, 2016 the Landlord charged and collected $750.00 each month from the Tenant. 10. The reason this is important is because s. 113 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) says the lawful rent is the rent first charged to the Tenant subject to any discounts offered under s. 111. 11. The scheme of the Act tightly regulates rent increases and decreases. None of what the Tenant describes constitutes a legal decrease in the rent under any of the relevant provisions of the Act nor was a new tenancy agreement entered into. (See for example, ss. 111, and 125.) Pursuant to s. 3 of the Act, the provisions of the Act apply despite any agreement or waiver to the contrary. So absent a legally recognizable agreement to decrease the rent or a new tenancy agreement, the lawful monthly rent here has always been $750.00. 12. As explained further below, the Tenant was essentially illegally evicted effective April 21, 2018. The arrears of rent and daily compensation owing for the period ending April 21, 2018 total $5,443.84. 13. The Landlord collected a last month’s rent deposit from the Tenant of $500.00. Pursuant to subsection 106(10) of the Act the deposit must be applied to the rent due for the last month of the tenancy. 14. Interest is owing on the deposit for the period July 1, 2015 to May 31, 2018 totalling $26.76. 15. The Landlord incurred costs of $190.00 for filing the application and is entitled to reimbursement of those costs. THE TENANT’S CLAIMS OF ILLEGAL ENTRY 16. The relationship between the parties seems to have gone seriously wrong as a result of events that flowed from the rental unit having a problem with mice. 17. The problem with the mice seems to date back to 2016 which is a period outside of the Board’s one year limitation period (see section 29(2)). But what the Tenant is really complaining about is what happened on February 17, 2018. 18. The Tenant complained to the Landlord about the mice in his unit so the Landlord or his spouse contacted a contractor and the Landlord told the Tenant the contractor would come in to address the issue within 48 hours. The Tenant wanted prompter action and told the Landlord that was unreasonable. According to the Tenant, the Landlord called him a “bitch” and a “little wife” and the Tenant went back downstairs for a nap. 19. The Landlord does not specifically deny saying these things to the Tenant. He just says the Tenant was very arrogant and being unreasonable. 20. A couple of hours later the Landlord’s spouse texted the Tenant to say the contractor would be there in 10 minutes. According to the Tenant, the contractor then barged into his unit. The Tenant told the contractor he had not received proper notice of entry, this was a bad time, and asked him to leave. When the contractor expressed reluctance, the Tenant called 911 and the contractor left immediately. That was about 7 p.m. on February 17, 2018. 21. Section 25 of the Act says a landlord can only enter a rental unit in accordance with the Act. Section 26 details examples of when notice is not required. In this situation none of the provisions of s. 26 apply. The mice were not an emergency despite the Tenant’s insistence that 48 hours was too long to wait, and the Tenant did not let the contractor into the unit at the time of entry. As notice of entry was not served in accordance with s. 27 of the Act, the entry was not in compliance with the Act. As the Landlord is responsible for the acts of his contractors and agents, this means I am satisfied that on February 17, 2018 the Landlord breached s. 25 of the Act. 22. With respect to the Landlord calling the Tenant a “bitch” and a “little wife”, the Landlord does not deny that occurred so I am satisfied that it did. Name calling like that is unprofessional behaviour. A landlord is a business professional selling a vital service to a customer so the Landlord here ought to have known that such remarks were inappropriate and would be most unwelcome to the average tenant. In other words, the Landlord’s remarks constitute a breach of s. 23 of the Act. 23. During this series of events the Landlord actually left the City to go to the United States. He left February 17, 2018 and was away until February 23, 2018. 24. About three hours after the Tenant got the contractor to leave, the Tenant went outside to smoke and found the tires of his car slashed. He called the police and told them he believed the contractor was responsible but the police told them there was insufficient evidence to establish that. 25. That is also true for my purposes here. The evidence is insufficient to establish it is more likely than not the contractor slashed the Tenant’s tires. Even if I was prepared to make a finding the contractor did it, that behaviour was clearly outside of the scope of his authority from the Landlord. The Landlord hired the contractor to deal with the mice issue not to slash the Tenant’s tires, so even if the contractor did do it the evidence is insufficient to establish the Landlord should be held liable for the contractor’s behaviour. 26. With respect to the Landlord’s breaches of the Act as found above, remedy is discussed below. THE LANDLORD’S NOTICES OF TERMINATION 27. After the Tenant discovered his tires slashed he became very angry. He blamed the Landlord for what happened. He broke into the Landlord’s private space upstairs. He broke the bedroom door, damaged the ceiling, and made a mess throwing plants around. 28. The Tenant attempted to clean up and apologised to the Landlord. He offered to pay $100.00 for the damage. But when the Landlord returned from the United States, the Landlord called the police. 29. The police came to the residential complex on or about February 25, 2018 and interviewed the parties. By that point in time the Landlord just wanted the Tenant to move out. He says his wife did not want to stay there as long as the Tenant remained in the rental unit below. So the police suggested that the Tenant could avoid criminal charges if he agreed to move out. 30. As far as I can tell from the Tenant’s testimony, he thought better of his initial agreement to this offer and called the police station. The officers present at the house returned the Tenant’s keys to him and he was arrested and charged with mischief. 31. On March 9, 2018 the Landlord served two notices of termination on the Tenant, an N6 for illegal act pursuant to s. 61(2)(b) and a voidable N5 pursuant to both ss. 62 and 64. 32. At the hearing before the Board I pointed out to the parties that the Landlord’s application for an eviction order was essentially moot because the parties agree that the Landlord changed the code for the front door lock on April 21, 2018, and refused to give the Tenant the replacement code. In other words, the Tenant was for all intents and purposes illegally evicted on April 21, 2018. As the Tenant’s amended application seeks an order terminating the tenancy effective April 21, 2018, an order is going to issue terminating the tenancy on the Tenant’s application effective April 21, 2018. 33. In other words, it was unnecessary to hear evidence in support of the allegations contained in the Landlord’s notices of termination. THE LANDLORD’S DAMAGE CLAIM 34. The Landlord’s application as filed seeks compensation of $1,300.00 for negligent or wilful damage to the residential complex pursuant to s. 89(1) of the Act. However, the application contains no particulars. 35. On the day of the hearing before the Board the Landlord filed a request to amend his damage claim and served it on the Tenant. The Tenant consented to the Board amending the application as requested by the Landlord so I proceeded to hear the amended damage claim. 36. The Landlord’s evidence establishes that he paid his contractor $1,469.00 to repair the stucco on his bedroom ceiling, prime and paint the room, and replace the door and lock. 37. The Tenant questions the reasonableness of this amount, but led no evidence in support of the proposition that another contractor would have charged less, or in support of the possibility the Landlord did not in fact pay that amount to his contractor. 38. According to the Landlord he received a second quote that was similar. 39. In the end result the Landlord’s evidence is sufficient to establish that it is more likely than not that he paid $1,469.00 to repair the wilful damage the Tenant did to the Landlord’s bedroom and that amount represents the reasonable cost of repair. 40. The second part of the Landlord’s claim is more problematic. It claims $226.00 for cleaning out the basement and disposing of the contents. It also claims $1,356.00 for “sanitizing” the basement, cleaning the graffiti and priming and painting the rental unit. 41. Damage claims under the Act are brought pursuant to s. 89(1) which says: A landlord may apply to the Board for an order requiring a tenant to pay reasonable costs that the landlord has incurred or will incur for the repair of or, where repairing is not reasonable, the replacement of damaged property, if the tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person whom the tenant permits in the residential complex wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to the rental unit or the residential complex and the tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 42. As can be seen from this provision it is about physical damage to the property and not cleaning or sanitizing. 43. More importantly perhaps, the Landlord’s behaviour in removing the Tenant’s possessions from the rental unit was actually an illegal act for the reasons stated below in the context of the Tenant application. The Landlord cannot be entitled to claim against the Tenant costs he incurred as a result of the Landlord’s own illegal behaviour. 44. Given the above, the $226.00 claimed by the Landlord for cleaning out the basement and disposing of the contents is denied. 45. The Tenant does not deny that what the Landlord calls graffiti on the walls of the rental unit is decoration the Tenant added to the rental unit. Nor does he deny the unit needed to be painted as a result. 46. But the Tenant says that he offered to paint the unit himself once he removed his possessions. That was always the plan for when the Tenant moved out prior to the disintegration of the relationship. At that point the Landlord refused to let the Tenant do the work himself and the Tenant never had a chance to do it anyway because of the illegal eviction. The Landlord does not dispute this. 47. The Tenant and the Landlord agree that before the Tenant moved in the Landlord paid the Tenant to paint the unit himself. The Landlord says he paid the Tenant $1,000.00. The Tenant says he was paid $500.00. 48. The reason this is important is because s. 16 of the Act says: When a landlord or a tenant becomes liable to pay any amount as a result of a breach of a tenancy agreement, the person entitled to claim the amount has a duty to take reasonable steps to minimize the person’s losses. 49. In this context s. 16 means the Landlord was obligated to take reasonable steps to minimize the cost of repainting the unit. As the Tenant had apparently done an acceptable job in exchange for good consideration before, it is not clear to me that it was particularly reasonable for the Landlord to refuse to let him paint it again. The is particularly true here because if the Landlord had simply followed the process in the Act to obtain a legal eviction order from the Board, the undisputed evidence of the Tenant suggests the Tenant would have returned the unit to its original condition. 50. As a result, I am not prepared to find that the Landlord reasonably mitigated the Tenant’s losses or that the costs the Landlord incurred in hiring a contractor to paint the unit were reasonable. So that part of the Landlord’s damage claim is also denied. MISCELLANEOUS OTHER CLAIMS BY THE TENANT 51. After the police became involved in February and the Landlord started serving notices of termination in March, the Tenant filed this application with the Board on March 23, 2018. He subsequently filed and served a request to amend the application on April 25, 2018. As the Landlord was properly served I granted the Tenant’s request to amend his application. 52. What appears to have happened after the police became involved and notices of termination served is that the parties’ relationship and behaviour deteriorated further. 53. The Tenant says that on March 28, 2018, the Landlord turned on the music in his part of the residential complex, turned it up very loud, and went out. The Landlord says this was not true; he was home, it did not happen. 54. As the Tenant bears the burden of proof with respect to this allegation and the evidence of the parties is essentially equal but opposite I find that the Tenant has led insufficient evidence to establish the Landlord harassed him on March 28, 2018 by playing music loudly and leaving it on while he went out. 55. The Tenant says the Landlord did this a second time on March 29, 2018. So the Tenant turned off the electricity to stop the noise. That caused a malfunction in an alarm in the basement triggering an annoying intermittent beeping. When the beeping did not stop the Tenant told the Landlord he could not live like that. The Tenant says the Landlord told him it was his own fault and flipped him the middle finger. 56. The Landlord acknowledges the Tenant turned off the electricity because the Landlord was playing music. He did not dispute the Tenant’s evidence that the Landlord told him it was his fault nor does the Landlord deny flipping him the middle finger. 57. There can be no excuse for a landlord “flipping the finger” at a tenant. Any reasonable landlord knows or ought to know that such behaviour is unprofessional and would be unwelcome to any reasonable tenant. So I am satisfied that in doing so the Landlord breached s. 23 of the Act. 58. Because of the beeping the Tenant rented alternative accommodation and stayed there from March 29, 2018 to April 22, 2018. He paid $685.00 for that alternative accommodation. 59. Although I would agree with the Landlord that the Tenant is partially responsible for the annoying beeping because he turned off the electricity, I am satisfied that the Tenant did so because of the Landlord’s behaviour in playing loud music. That being said, the reasonable thing the Tenant should have done, but did not, was ask the Landlord to turn the music down. 60. Given all of the above, I do not believe the Landlord can be held financially responsible for the disturbance caused by the beeping. The Tenant is not entitled to an order for $685.00 for the place he stayed in from March 29, 2018 to April 22, 2018. 61. During this period the Tenant went back and forth to the rental unit. 62. He says that on April 3, 2018 he noticed $150.00 was missing from his coffee table indicating someone was in his unit. The Landlord says “why would I take the Tenant’s money?” which I took to mean the Landlord denies entering the rental unit or stealing money from the Tenant. 63. The evidence with respect to this money and the alleged illegal entry is simply insufficient to meet the Tenant’s burden of proof. He may have had money go missing; but he may not have. So that part of the Tenant’s application must also be dismissed. 64. On April 17, 2018 the beeping noise was repaired. THE CHANGING OF THE LOCKS 65. On April 21, 2018 the Tenant discovered the key pad code to the front door had been changed but he was able to get into the residential complex because the cleaner was there. The Tenant says when he asked the Landlord for the new code, the Landlord refused so the Tenant threatened to turn the power off again. The Tenant says the Landlord was in his face yelling at that point so the Tenant called 911 again. 66. The Landlord confirms he refused to give the Tenant the new code because the Tenant had not paid rent for the month of April, 2018. 67. Section 24 of the Act says: A landlord shall not alter the locking system on a door giving entry to a rental unit or residential complex or cause the locking system to be altered during the tenant’s occupancy of the rental unit without giving the tenant replacement keys. 68. By changing the key pad code and refusing to give him the new one the Landlord breached s. 24 of the Act. Remedy with respect to this breach is discussed below. 69. According to the Tenant, when the police arrived they told him that nothing was in writing so he had to leave. The Tenant was given four hours to remove all of his possessions which was not sufficient time. He also says the Landlord refused to let him access his stored possessions in the garage. 70. The Landlord confirms the police gave the Tenant four hours to remove his possessions but says the Landlord offered him more time. According to the Landlord the Tenant returned on April 30, 2018 to remove more of his possessions but the stuff left in the unit downstairs after that was garbage. So the Landlord put it out in bags and the Tenant did not come to retrieve it. However, the Landlord admits that he told the Tenant he would not let the Tenant access possessions in the garage unless the Tenant cleaned out the rental unit first. 71. I would note at this point that the police had no right to tell the Tenant he had four hours to collect his possessions and leave. Subsection 168(2) of the Act says: The Board has exclusive jurisdiction to determine all applications under this Act and with respect to all matters in which jurisdiction is conferred on it by this Act. 72. Moreover, s. 37(1) says: A tenancy may be terminated only in accordance with this Act. 73. This means that only the Board had the authority to tell the Tenant when and if he had to move out. 74. At that point in time the Landlord had filed an application with the Board for eviction but that application had not been heard. Even if the Landlord had obtained an eviction order, the Board’s orders cannot be enforced by a landlord or by the police; they are enforceable only through the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) as they are the legal equivalent of writs of possession. The Sheriff gives tenants notice as to when they are coming and a tenant has 72 hours after a legal eviction to recover his or her possessions. 75. Further, the Tenant here had clearly not abandoned the unit. His possessions were there. He was returning to the unit on a regular basis. 76. So what happened to the Tenant on April 21, 2018 was also an illegal eviction. By putting the Tenant out of possession, clearing out the unit of the Tenant’s remaining items, and refusing the Tenant’s request to recover his possessions in the garage, the Landlord breached sections 22 and 23 of the Act. Again, remedy is discussed further below. 77. On May 3, 2018 the Landlord put the Tenant’s remaining possessions out on the curb and sent the Tenant a text showing the Tenant the bags sitting outside. 78. The Tenant says he found a new place to live and was able to get possession of his new rental unit on April 22, 2018. REMEDIES FOR THE LANDLORD’S BREACHES 79. The Tenant’s application seeks: abatement of the rent; a cease and desist order; compensation for out of pocket expenses; an administrative fine; and termination of the tenancy. 80. The request for a cease and desist order is with respect to the illegal entry and is no longer relevant as the Tenant no longer lives in the rental unit. 81. However, the amended application also seeks an order requiring the Landlord to return to the Tenant any of his possessions still in the garage. The Tenant is entitled to such an order. 82. The request for compensation for out of pocket expenses is for rat poison, traps and door “scrapes”. No evidence was led in support of these claims but even if it had been they would have been denied. As I stated at the hearing, this application is not based on the rights and obligations set out in s. 20(1) of the Act. The breaches by the Landlord of the Act as set out above, are not connected to these claims so they are denied accordingly. 83. In the amended application the Tenant seeks $500.00 for moving costs plus the cost of staying elsewhere for the period March 29, 2018 and April 22, 2018. No evidence was led that the Tenant incurred moving expenses and for the reasons already stated above, the Tenant is not entitled to a remedy for the cost of staying elsewhere due to the beeping. 84. As stated above, the tenancy shall be terminated effective April 21, 2018. The Landlord’s behaviour in changing the locks and illegally evicting the Tenant justifies such an order. 85. That leaves the claims for abatement and an administrative fine. 86. Abatement of the rent is a contractual remedy entitled to reflect the idea that the Tenant is paying for a bundle of goods and services and if the Tenant is not receiving those goods and services the rent should be abated proportional to the difference between what is being paid for and what is being received. 87. The Tenant here is clearly entitled to abatement of the rent. 88. With respect to the illegal entry by the Landlord’s contractor on February 17, 2018, although the entry was illegal and the Tenant was entitled to notice of a specific date and time at least 24 hours in advance, one of the reasons the Tenant did not receive proper notice is because he insisted the mice problem be addressed quickly. The 48 hours’ notice he was given was not quick enough. So it seems to me to be somewhat unreasonable to award the Tenant any significant abatement for the entry as the Landlord was simply trying to acquiesce to the Tenant’s demands. As a result, only a minimal abatement is warranted which I fix at $50.00. 89. With respect to the name calling on February 17, 2018, and the Landlord flipping the Tenant the finger on March 29, 2018, abatement of the rent is justified. The Tenant led little evidence as to how these events impacted him but he does say he felt belittled and depressed. Given all of the evidence before me and my knowledge of similar like cases before the Board, it seems to me that a reasonable abatement of the rent for these two breaches would be $200.00 each for a total of $400.00. 90. With respect to the changing of the locks, the disposal of the Tenant’s possessions, the refusal to let the Tenant access the garage, and the illegal eviction, I believe a reasonable abatement of the rent would be two month’s rent or $1,600.00. I say this based on similar like cases before the Board and because even though the Tenant found another place to live the day following the illegal eviction, the sequence of events described above was clearly distressing to the Tenant. 91. The final request in the amended application is for an administrative fine. 92. With respect to the request for an administrative fine the Board’s Interpretation Guideline # 16 on Administrative Fines says: An administrative fine is a remedy to be used by the Board to encourage compliance with the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “RTA”), and to deter landlords from engaging in similar activity in the future. This remedy is not normally imposed unless a landlord has shown a blatant disregard for the RTA and other remedies will not provide adequate deterrence and compliance. 93. The Landlord here has clearly shown a blatant disregard for the Act. Changing the locks, illegal evicting the Tenant, and refusing to give him access to his possessions all demonstrate an utter disregard for the Tenant’s rights and the law. 94. In terms of quantum for the fine, the remedies granted above to the Tenant are relatively minor. Further, the nature of the behaviour in question is such that a substantial fine is warranted. Given all of the above, and my knowledge of similar like circumstances I am satisfied an administrative fine of $5,000.00 is warranted. An order shall issue accordingly. 95. This order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued. It is ordered that: 1. On or before August 15, 2018, the Landlord shall deliver to the Tenant any of the Tenant’s possessions still in the Landlord’s control and give the Tenant access to the garage at the residential complex on a date and time of the Tenant’s choosing. 2. The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4,336.08. This amount represents rent arrears and daily compensation owing up to April 21, 2018, plus compensation for undue damage to the residential complex caused by the Tenant’s wilful or negligent behaviour, less the Tenant’s last month’s rent deposit and interest owing on the deposit and the amount the Landlord owes the Tenant for abatements of the rent. 3. The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application. 4. The total amount the Tenant owes the Landlord under this order is $4,526.08. 5. If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing by August 3, 2018, the Tenant will owe interest.

(the 'Tenant') applied for an order determining that M.M. (the 'Landlord') or the Landlord's agent harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with the Tenant, entered the rental unit illegally, altered the locking system on a door giving entry to the rental unit or residential complex without giving the Tenant replacement keys, and substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex.  The Landlord applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant did not pay the rent the Tenant owes, and because the Tenant has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord, committed an illegal act, and wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.  This application was heard in Toronto on May 25, 2018.  The Tenant and the Landlord attended the hearing.  Determinations:  1. These applications are about a friendly relationship that went very bad. So bad that criminal charges are pending against the Tenant. 2. The parties used to be friends. The Tenant has lived in the Landlord’s one bedroom basement apartment more than once. He lived there about six years ago, moved out and then moved in again in July of 2015.   THE ARREARS OF RENT 3. The parties agree that there was no written tenancy agreement between them but disagree as to the lawful monthly rent charged. 4. Both the Landlord and the Tenant say that initially the monthly rent agreed to was $750.00. They also both agree that the Tenant subsequently told the Landlord he could not afford that amount. 5. The Tenant says that they agreed the rent would be lowered to $650.00. He further says the Landlord agreed to “cook the books” and issue receipts for $550.00 even though the Tenant was paying $650.00. This was because the Tenant is in receipt of social assistance from Ontario Works (‘OW’) and his worker told him he had to have cheaper housing. 6. The Landlord says that because the Tenant was financially struggling he agreed to accept payments towards the rent and the Tenant would pay any shortfall when his situation improved. They were friends so the Landlord just left the situation as it was. 7. The only documentary evidence produced by either party about the lawful monthly rent is a series of receipts produced by the Landlord. 8. Based on the receipts and the evidence of both parties I am satisfied that the tenancy commenced July 1, 2015 and the parties agreed to a monthly rent of $750.00. 9. The receipts corroborate the evidence of both the Landlord and the Tenant in that they show for July and August of 2015 the Landlord collected $750.00 each month plus an additional $500.00 as a last month’s rent deposit. The receipts also indicate that until February 28, 2016 the Landlord charged and collected $750.00 each month from the Tenant.  10. The reason this is important is because s. 113 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) says the lawful rent is the rent first charged to the Tenant subject to any discounts offered under s. 111. 11. The scheme of the Act tightly regulates rent increases and decreases. None of what the Tenant describes constitutes a legal decrease in the rent under any of the relevant provisions of the Act nor was a new tenancy agreement entered into. (See for example, ss. 111, and 125.) Pursuant to s. 3 of the Act, the provisions of the Act apply despite any agreement or waiver to the contrary. So absent a legally recognizable agreement to decrease the rent or a new tenancy agreement, the lawful monthly rent here has always been $750.00. 12. As explained further below, the Tenant was essentially illegally evicted effective April 21, 2018. The arrears of rent and daily compensation owing for the period ending April 21, 2018 total $5,443.84. 13. The Landlord collected a last month’s rent deposit from the Tenant of $500.00. Pursuant to subsection 106(10) of the Act the deposit must be applied to the rent due for the last month of the tenancy. 14. Interest is owing on the deposit for the period July 1, 2015 to May 31, 2018 totalling $26.76. 15. The Landlord incurred costs of $190.00 for filing the application and is entitled to reimbursement of those costs. THE TENANT’S CLAIMS OF ILLEGAL ENTRY 16. The relationship between the parties seems to have gone seriously wrong as a result of events that flowed from the rental unit having a problem with mice. 17. The problem with the mice seems to date back to 2016 which is a period outside of the Board’s one year limitation period (see section 29(2)). But what the Tenant is really complaining about is what happened on February 17, 2018. 18. The Tenant complained to the Landlord about the mice in his unit so the Landlord or his spouse contacted a contractor and the Landlord told the Tenant the contractor would come in to address the issue within 48 hours. The Tenant wanted prompter action and told the Landlord that was unreasonable. According to the Tenant, the Landlord called him a “bitch” and a “little wife” and the Tenant went back downstairs for a nap. 19. The Landlord does not specifically deny saying these things to the Tenant. He just says the Tenant was very arrogant and being unreasonable. 20. A couple of hours later the Landlord’s spouse texted the Tenant to say the contractor would be there in 10 minutes. According to the Tenant, the contractor then barged into his unit. The Tenant told the contractor he had not received proper notice of entry, this was a bad time, and asked him to leave. When the contractor expressed reluctance, the Tenant called 911 and the contractor left immediately. That was about 7 p.m. on February 17, 2018. 21. Section 25 of the Act says a landlord can only enter a rental unit in accordance with the Act. Section 26 details examples of when notice is not required. In this situation none of the provisions of s. 26 apply. The mice were not an emergency despite the Tenant’s insistence that 48 hours was too long to wait, and the Tenant did not let the contractor into the unit at the time of entry. As notice of entry was not served in accordance with s. 27 of the Act, the entry was not in compliance with the Act. As the Landlord is responsible for the acts of his contractors and agents, this means I am satisfied that on February 17, 2018 the Landlord breached s. 25 of the Act. 22. With respect to the Landlord calling the Tenant a “bitch” and a “little wife”, the Landlord does not deny that occurred so I am satisfied that it did. Name calling like that is unprofessional behaviour. A landlord is a business professional selling a vital service to a customer so the Landlord here ought to have known that such remarks were inappropriate and would be most unwelcome to the average tenant. In other words, the Landlord’s remarks constitute a breach of s. 23 of the Act. 23. During this series of events the Landlord actually left the City to go to the United States. He left February 17, 2018 and was away until February 23, 2018. 24. About three hours after the Tenant got the contractor to leave, the Tenant went outside to smoke and found the tires of his car slashed. He called the police and told them he believed the contractor was responsible but the police told them there was insufficient evidence to establish that. 25. That is also true for my purposes here. The evidence is insufficient to establish it is more likely than not the contractor slashed the Tenant’s tires. Even if I was prepared to make a finding the contractor did it, that behaviour was clearly outside of the scope of his authority from the Landlord. The Landlord hired the contractor to deal with the mice issue not to slash the Tenant’s tires, so even if the contractor did do it the evidence is insufficient to establish the Landlord should be held liable for the contractor’s behaviour. 26. With respect to the Landlord’s breaches of the Act as found above, remedy is discussed below. THE LANDLORD’S NOTICES OF TERMINATION 27. After the Tenant discovered his tires slashed he became very angry. He blamed the Landlord for what happened. He broke into the Landlord’s private space upstairs. He broke the bedroom door, damaged the ceiling, and made a mess throwing plants around. 28. The Tenant attempted to clean up and apologised to the Landlord. He offered to pay $100.00 for the damage. But when the Landlord returned from the United States, the Landlord called the police. 29. The police came to the residential complex on or about February 25, 2018 and interviewed the parties. By that point in time the Landlord just wanted the Tenant to move out. He says his wife did not want to stay there as long as the Tenant remained in the rental unit below. So the police suggested that the Tenant could avoid criminal charges if he agreed to move out. 30. As far as I can tell from the Tenant’s testimony, he thought better of his initial agreement to this offer and called the police station. The officers present at the house returned the Tenant’s keys to him and he was arrested and charged with mischief. 31. On March 9, 2018 the Landlord served two notices of termination on the Tenant, an N6 for illegal act pursuant to s. 61(2)(b) and a voidable N5 pursuant to both ss. 62 and 64. 32. At the hearing before the Board I pointed out to the parties that the Landlord’s application for an eviction order was essentially moot because the parties agree that the Landlord changed the code for the front door lock on April 21, 2018, and refused to give the Tenant the replacement code. In other words, the Tenant was for all intents and purposes illegally evicted on April 21, 2018. As the Tenant’s amended application seeks an order terminating the tenancy effective April 21, 2018, an order is going to issue terminating the tenancy on the Tenant’s application effective April 21, 2018. 33. In other words, it was unnecessary to hear evidence in support of the allegations contained in the Landlord’s notices of termination. THE LANDLORD’S DAMAGE CLAIM 34. The Landlord’s application as filed seeks compensation of $1,300.00 for negligent or wilful damage to the residential complex pursuant to s. 89(1) of the Act. However, the application contains no particulars. 35. On the day of the hearing before the Board the Landlord filed a request to amend his damage claim and served it on the Tenant. The Tenant consented to the Board amending the application as requested by the Landlord so I proceeded to hear the amended damage claim. 36. The Landlord’s evidence establishes that he paid his contractor $1,469.00 to repair the stucco on his bedroom ceiling, prime and paint the room, and replace the door and lock. 37. The Tenant questions the reasonableness of this amount, but led no evidence in support of the proposition that another contractor would have charged less, or in support of the possibility the Landlord did not in fact pay that amount to his contractor. 38. According to the Landlord he received a second quote that was similar. 39. In the end result the Landlord’s evidence is sufficient to establish that it is more likely than not that he paid $1,469.00 to repair the wilful damage the Tenant did to the Landlord’s bedroom and that amount represents the reasonable cost of repair. 40. The second part of the Landlord’s claim is more problematic. It claims $226.00 for cleaning out the basement and disposing of the contents. It also claims $1,356.00 for “sanitizing” the basement, cleaning the graffiti and priming and painting the rental unit. 41. Damage claims under the Act are brought pursuant to s. 89(1) which says: A landlord may apply to the Board for an order requiring a tenant to pay reasonable costs that the landlord has incurred or will incur for the repair of or, where repairing is not reasonable, the replacement of damaged property, if the tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person whom the tenant permits in the residential complex wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to the rental unit or the residential complex and the tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 42. As can be seen from this provision it is about physical damage to the property and not cleaning or sanitizing. 43. More importantly perhaps, the Landlord’s behaviour in removing the Tenant’s possessions from the rental unit was actually an illegal act for the reasons stated below in the context of the Tenant application. The Landlord cannot be entitled to claim against the Tenant costs he incurred as a result of the Landlord’s own illegal behaviour. 44. Given the above, the $226.00 claimed by the Landlord for cleaning out the basement and disposing of the contents is denied.  45. The Tenant does not deny that what the Landlord calls graffiti on the walls of the rental unit is decoration the Tenant added to the rental unit. Nor does he deny the unit needed to be painted as a result.  46. But the Tenant says that he offered to paint the unit himself once he removed his possessions. That was always the plan for when the Tenant moved out prior to the disintegration of the relationship. At that point the Landlord refused to let the Tenant do the work himself and the Tenant never had a chance to do it anyway because of the illegal eviction. The Landlord does not dispute this. 47. The Tenant and the Landlord agree that before the Tenant moved in the Landlord paid the Tenant to paint the unit himself. The Landlord says he paid the Tenant $1,000.00. The Tenant says he was paid $500.00. 48. The reason this is important is because s. 16 of the Act says: When a landlord or a tenant becomes liable to pay any amount as a result of a breach of a tenancy agreement, the person entitled to claim the amount has a duty to take reasonable steps to minimize the person’s losses. 49. In this context s. 16 means the Landlord was obligated to take reasonable steps to minimize the cost of repainting the unit. As the Tenant had apparently done an acceptable job in exchange for good consideration before, it is not clear to me that it was particularly reasonable for the Landlord to refuse to let him paint it again. The is particularly true here because if the Landlord had simply followed the process in the Act to obtain a legal eviction order from the Board, the undisputed evidence of the Tenant suggests the Tenant would have returned the unit to its original condition. 50. As a result, I am not prepared to find that the Landlord reasonably mitigated the Tenant’s losses or that the costs the Landlord incurred in hiring a contractor to paint the unit were reasonable. So that part of the Landlord’s damage claim is also denied. MISCELLANEOUS OTHER CLAIMS BY THE TENANT 51. After the police became involved in February and the Landlord started serving notices of termination in March, the Tenant filed this application with the Board on March 23, 2018. He subsequently filed and served a request to amend the application on April 25, 2018. As the Landlord was properly served I granted the Tenant’s request to amend his application. 52. What appears to have happened after the police became involved and notices of termination served is that the parties’ relationship and behaviour deteriorated further. 53. The Tenant says that on March 28, 2018, the Landlord turned on the music in his part of the residential complex, turned it up very loud, and went out. The Landlord says this was not true; he was home, it did not happen. 54. As the Tenant bears the burden of proof with respect to this allegation and the evidence of the parties is essentially equal but opposite I find that the Tenant has led insufficient evidence to establish the Landlord harassed him on March 28, 2018 by playing music loudly and leaving it on while he went out. 55. The Tenant says the Landlord did this a second time on March 29, 2018. So the Tenant turned off the electricity to stop the noise. That caused a malfunction in an alarm in the basement triggering an annoying intermittent beeping. When the beeping did not stop the Tenant told the Landlord he could not live like that. The Tenant says the Landlord told him it was his own fault and flipped him the middle finger. 56. The Landlord acknowledges the Tenant turned off the electricity because the Landlord was playing music. He did not dispute the Tenant’s evidence that the Landlord told him it was his fault nor does the Landlord deny flipping him the middle finger. 57. There can be no excuse for a landlord “flipping the finger” at a tenant. Any reasonable landlord knows or ought to know that such behaviour is unprofessional and would be unwelcome to any reasonable tenant. So I am satisfied that in doing so the Landlord breached s. 23 of the Act. 58. Because of the beeping the Tenant rented alternative accommodation and stayed there from March 29, 2018 to April 22, 2018. He paid $685.00 for that alternative accommodation. 59. Although I would agree with the Landlord that the Tenant is partially responsible for the annoying beeping because he turned off the electricity, I am satisfied that the Tenant did so because of the Landlord’s behaviour in playing loud music. That being said, the reasonable thing the Tenant should have done, but did not, was ask the Landlord to turn the music down. 60. Given all of the above, I do not believe the Landlord can be held financially responsible for the disturbance caused by the beeping. The Tenant is not entitled to an order for $685.00 for the place he stayed in from March 29, 2018 to April 22, 2018. 61. During this period the Tenant went back and forth to the rental unit. 62. He says that on April 3, 2018 he noticed $150.00 was missing from his coffee table indicating someone was in his unit. The Landlord says “why would I take the Tenant’s money?” which I took to mean the Landlord denies entering the rental unit or stealing money from the Tenant. 63. The evidence with respect to this money and the alleged illegal entry is simply insufficient to meet the Tenant’s burden of proof. He may have had money go missing; but he may not have. So that part of the Tenant’s application must also be dismissed. 64. On April 17, 2018 the beeping noise was repaired. THE CHANGING OF THE LOCKS 65. On April 21, 2018 the Tenant discovered the key pad code to the front door had been changed but he was able to get into the residential complex because the cleaner was there. The Tenant says when he asked the Landlord for the new code, the Landlord refused so the Tenant threatened to turn the power off again. The Tenant says the Landlord was in his face yelling at that point so the Tenant called 911 again. 66. The Landlord confirms he refused to give the Tenant the new code because the Tenant had not paid rent for the month of April, 2018. 67. Section 24 of the Act says: A landlord shall not alter the locking system on a door giving entry to a rental unit or residential complex or cause the locking system to be altered during the tenant’s occupancy of the rental unit without giving the tenant replacement keys. 68. By changing the key pad code and refusing to give him the new one the Landlord breached s. 24 of the Act. Remedy with respect to this breach is discussed below. 69. According to the Tenant, when the police arrived they told him that nothing was in writing so he had to leave. The Tenant was given four hours to remove all of his possessions which was not sufficient time. He also says the Landlord refused to let him access his stored possessions in the garage. 70. The Landlord confirms the police gave the Tenant four hours to remove his possessions but says the Landlord offered him more time. According to the Landlord the Tenant returned on April 30, 2018 to remove more of his possessions but the stuff left in the unit downstairs after that was garbage. So the Landlord put it out in bags and the Tenant did not come to retrieve it. However, the Landlord admits that he told the Tenant he would not let the Tenant access possessions in the garage unless the Tenant cleaned out the rental unit first. 71. I would note at this point that the police had no right to tell the Tenant he had four hours to collect his possessions and leave. Subsection 168(2) of the Act says: The Board has exclusive jurisdiction to determine all applications under this Act and with respect to all matters in which jurisdiction is conferred on it by this Act. 72. Moreover, s. 37(1) says: A tenancy may be terminated only in accordance with this Act. 73. This means that only the Board had the authority to tell the Tenant when and if he had to move out. 74. At that point in time the Landlord had filed an application with the Board for eviction but that application had not been heard. Even if the Landlord had obtained an eviction order, the Board’s orders cannot be enforced by a landlord or by the police; they are enforceable only through the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) as they are the legal equivalent of writs of possession. The Sheriff gives tenants notice as to when they are coming and a tenant has 72 hours after a legal eviction to recover his or her possessions. 75. Further, the Tenant here had clearly not abandoned the unit. His possessions were there. He was returning to the unit on a regular basis. 76. So what happened to the Tenant on April 21, 2018 was also an illegal eviction. By putting the Tenant out of possession, clearing out the unit of the Tenant’s remaining items, and refusing the Tenant’s request to recover his possessions in the garage, the Landlord breached sections 22 and 23 of the Act. Again, remedy is discussed further below. 77. On May 3, 2018 the Landlord put the Tenant’s remaining possessions out on the curb and sent the Tenant a text showing the Tenant the bags sitting outside. 78. The Tenant says he found a new place to live and was able to get possession of his new rental unit on April 22, 2018. REMEDIES FOR THE LANDLORD’S BREACHES 79. The Tenant’s application seeks: abatement of the rent; a cease and desist order; compensation for out of pocket expenses; an administrative fine; and termination of the tenancy. 80. The request for a cease and desist order is with respect to the illegal entry and is no longer relevant as the Tenant no longer lives in the rental unit. 81. However, the amended application also seeks an order requiring the Landlord to return to the Tenant any of his possessions still in the garage. The Tenant is entitled to such an order. 82. The request for compensation for out of pocket expenses is for rat poison, traps and door “scrapes”. No evidence was led in support of these claims but even if it had been they would have been denied. As I stated at the hearing, this application is not based on the rights and obligations set out in s. 20(1) of the Act. The breaches by the Landlord of the Act as set out above, are not connected to these claims so they are denied accordingly. 83. In the amended application the Tenant seeks $500.00 for moving costs plus the cost of staying elsewhere for the period March 29, 2018 and April 22, 2018. No evidence was led that the Tenant incurred moving expenses and for the reasons already stated above, the Tenant is not entitled to a remedy for the cost of staying elsewhere due to the beeping. 84. As stated above, the tenancy shall be terminated effective April 21, 2018. The Landlord’s behaviour in changing the locks and illegally evicting the Tenant justifies such an order. 85. That leaves the claims for abatement and an administrative fine. 86. Abatement of the rent is a contractual remedy entitled to reflect the idea that the Tenant is paying for a bundle of goods and services and if the Tenant is not receiving those goods and services the rent should be abated proportional to the difference between what is being paid for and what is being received. 87. The Tenant here is clearly entitled to abatement of the rent. 88. With respect to the illegal entry by the Landlord’s contractor on February 17, 2018, although the entry was illegal and the Tenant was entitled to notice of a specific date and time at least 24 hours in advance, one of the reasons the Tenant did not receive proper notice is because he insisted the mice problem be addressed quickly. The 48 hours’ notice he was given was not quick enough. So it seems to me to be somewhat unreasonable to award the Tenant any significant abatement for the entry as the Landlord was simply trying to acquiesce to the Tenant’s demands. As a result, only a minimal abatement is warranted which I fix at $50.00. 89. With respect to the name calling on February 17, 2018, and the Landlord flipping the Tenant the finger on March 29, 2018, abatement of the rent is justified. The Tenant led little evidence as to how these events impacted him but he does say he felt belittled and depressed. Given all of the evidence before me and my knowledge of similar like cases before the Board, it seems to me that a reasonable abatement of the rent for these two breaches would be $200.00 each for a total of $400.00. 90. With respect to the changing of the locks, the disposal of the Tenant’s possessions, the refusal to let the Tenant access the garage, and the illegal eviction, I believe a reasonable abatement of the rent would be two month’s rent or $1,600.00. I say this based on similar like cases before the Board and because even though the Tenant found another place to live the day following the illegal eviction, the sequence of events described above was clearly distressing to the Tenant. 91. The final request in the amended application is for an administrative fine. 92. With respect to the request for an administrative fine the Board’s Interpretation Guideline # 16 on Administrative Fines says: An administrative fine is a remedy to be used by the Board to encourage compliance with the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “RTA”), and to deter landlords from engaging in similar activity in the future. This remedy is not normally imposed unless a landlord has shown a blatant disregard for the RTA and other remedies will not provide adequate deterrence and compliance. 93. The Landlord here has clearly shown a blatant disregard for the Act. Changing the locks, illegal evicting the Tenant, and refusing to give him access to his possessions all demonstrate an utter disregard for the Tenant’s rights and the law. 94. In terms of quantum for the fine, the remedies granted above to the Tenant are relatively minor. Further, the nature of the behaviour in question is such that a substantial fine is warranted. Given all of the above, and my knowledge of similar like circumstances I am satisfied an administrative fine of $5,000.00 is warranted. An order shall issue accordingly. 95. This order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued. It is ordered that: 1. On or before August 15, 2018, the Landlord shall deliver to the Tenant any of the Tenant’s possessions still in the Landlord’s control and give the Tenant access to the garage at the residential complex on a date and time of the Tenant’s choosing. 2. The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4,336.08. This amount represents rent arrears and daily compensation owing up to April 21, 2018, plus compensation for undue damage to the residential complex caused by the Tenant’s wilful or negligent behaviour, less the Tenant’s last month’s rent deposit and interest owing on the deposit and the amount the Landlord owes the Tenant for abatements of the rent. 3. The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application. 4. The total amount the Tenant owes the Landlord under this order is $4,526.08. 5. If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing by August 3, 2018, the Tenant will owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from August 4, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding. 6. The Landlord shall pay $5,000.00 to the Board as an administrative fine on or before August 31, 2018.

KC and JC (the 'Landlords') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict JS (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes and because the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential
complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlords or another tenant. 
 
This application was heard in Windsor on
January 17, 2018.  The Landlords KC and JC, attended the hearing along with the
Landlords’ Legal Representative, LM.  The Tenant attended the hearing and spoke
with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.

4.      The Landlord is not holding a last month's rent deposit. 
5.      The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed. 
6.      The parties agree that the amount outstanding to January 31, 2018,
inclusive of rent arrears ($3,783.00), and costs ($175.00), is $3,985.00.
Section 82:
7.      The Tenant raises maintenance issues under section 82 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006.  The Tenant testified she has lived in the rental unit
for 17 years and in 2015 she told the Landlord the furnace was not working. 
According to the Tenant the furnace sits on cinder blocks under the house and
the gas company would not certify it for use.  The Tenant said the furnace
needed to be installed on a cement pad.  
8.      The Tenant said she used her wood stove for heat, but in mid-
December 2017 there was a fire in the chimney of the wood stove and the
Landlord did not fix it until January 13, 2018.  The Tenant said she was
without heat for a month.  The Tenant testified she used her oven and space
heaters to heat the unit. 
9.      The Tenant said she had her own contractor attend to the chimney
stack, but it was still not working properly.
10.   The Landlords said they purchased the property in March 2016 and
during their conversation with the Tenant, KC said the Tenant advised them she
preferred to use the wood stove as her source of heat and not to bother fixing
the furnace. 
11.   The Landlord, KC, testified that the first time they knew about the
heat situation was January 2, 2018 when they were contacted by the health
inspector.  KC said the Tenant never contacted them about the problem. KC said
the rental unit was equipped with baseboard heaters when they purchased it, but
without their knowledge, the heaters have been removed. 
12.   KC said that when they found out there was no heat from the health
inspector they advised the Tenant they would attend the property on January 3,
2018, but when they attended they were denied access because they had not
provided 24 hour written notice.  KC said they returned on January 5, 2018 with
the police after providing notice.  According to KC they brought space heaters
for the Tenant. 
13.   KC said when they inspected the rental unit they found the furnace
had never been turned on so they have made arrangements to have a new furnace
installed. 
14.   Because there had been a fire in the chimney stack, the Tenant told
the Landlord she had the chimney cleaned but it was still a problem.  KC said
they called chimney maintenance person to attend to the chimney but the weather
was not conducive to climbing onto the roof, so the first time the chimney
could be addressed was on January 13, 2018.  KC said the fire was caused by the
Tenant burning garbage and soft wood which clogged up the chimney.   
15.   JC testified that when he spoke with the Tenant she advised him she
preferred to use the stove for heat that is why they didn’t replace the
furnace.  JC said that if he had known it was going to be an issue, he would
have put a new furnace in right away.  In any event, the Landlords said they
would install a new furnace right away and it is so ordered. 
16.   I have considered all the evidence raised by the Tenant under
section 82 and I find that the Tenant failed to advise the Landlords that there
was no heat and the Landlords only found out about the heat situation on
January 2, 2018 through the health unit.  The Landlords acted quickly, but the
Tenant refused them entry when they attempted to attend the rental unit to
determine what needed to be done.  Once the Landlords gained entry, the chimney
stack was cleaned as soon as weather permitted.  
17.   Although the furnace was not functioning, the Tenant relied on the
wood stove as a preferred source of heat.  Given the lack of notice to the
Landlord about the heat issue, I do not find the Landlord is in breach of
section 20 or the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006.  The Landlords acted
promptly once notified and are prepared to install a new furnace now that they
are aware that the Tenant needs one. In any event, the Tenant had heat once the
Landlords were allowed access and able to get on the roof.  As of the date of
the hearing, the Tenant said she had heat.  Therefore I find that under section
83 there are no serious outstanding maintenance issues in the rental unit and
termination of the tenancy should not be denied.       
L2
Application:           
18.  
The Landlord served a first
N5 Notice to End Your Tenancy For Interfering with Others, Damages or
Overcrowding (N5) on September 15, 2017 because the Tenant allegedly left
garbage in the lane and the Tenant assaulted the Landlord, KC, when she went to
pick up rent. 
 
19.  
The Landlords said the
Tenant failed to clean up the lane, so didn’t void the first N5 Notice.  I am
satisfied the Tenant didn’t void the first N5 Notice and the Landlord can
proceed with the L2 Application on the first N5 Notice. 
 
Landlords’ Evidence
 
20.  
KC said she received a
notice from the City of Windsor on August 31, 2017 because there was refuse in
the lane of the property and the notice directed the Landlord to clean up the
debris or they would be charged for the cleanup (Exhibit #1).
 
21.  
On September 21, 2018 KC
said they went back to the property and cleaned up the refuse because the
Tenant had failed to adequately address the problem ( Exhibit #2). 
 
22.  
KC testified that when she
went to collect the rent on September 1, 2017, she brought paint the Tenant had
requested.  However, KC said the Tenant was not satisfied with the type of
paint and refused to pay rent, then the Tenant pushed KC and KC stumbled
backwards.  The Tenant then slammed the door in the Landlord’s face.  KC said
she called police.
 
23.  
KC stated she went home and
spoke with police about 7 or 8 pm.  KC then said she attended the police
station to fill out a report.  KC said she did not want the Tenant charged
because she did not want the Tenant to know where she lived. 
 
24.  
JC testified that he went to
the property on January 10, 2018 to discuss the furnace.  The Tenant had
violation papers she said was from Union Gas about the furnace.  JC said that
when he took the papers and attempted to leave to get copies, the Tenant
blocked the exit, pushed the Landlord and took the papers from him. JC said the
police were called by the Tenant and no charges were laid. JC said the police
advised him that he should bring the police every time he attended the rental
unit.
 
Tenant’s Evidence
 
25.  
The Tenant didn’t deny that
she failed to clean up the lane after receiving the N5 Notice.  The Tenant
stated she thought she had an arrangement with the Landlords that they would
clean up the refuse in the lane as she had no way of getting rid of all of the
materials.  The Landlords denied they had any arrangement with the Tenant.  The
Tenant said some of the items were hers, but some belonged to neighbours.  In
any event, the Tenant said her belongings had been piled in the lane for about
eight months and she tried to clean up what she could but wasn’t able to get
rid of everything.
 
26.  
On September 1, 2017, the
Tenant said the Landlord, KC, brought paint but it was the wrong kind of paint. 
The Tenant testified the Landlord was standing on the porch and she shut slammed
the main door shut, but didn’t touch KC.  The Tenant said she heard nothing
from the police.
 
27.  
On January 10, 2018, the
Tenant testified the Landlord came to her rental unit and tried to take the
Union Gas violation notices.  The Tenant said she was afraid the Landlord would
not bring the notices back to her, so she grabbed them from him.  In the
process the Tenant said JC stepped on her foot which caused it to bruise.
 
28.  
The Tenant said she called
police and no charges were laid even though she requested a peace bond and
assault charges. The Tenant said she suffers from anxiety and “flips out
sometimes”.
 
29.  
I find that the evidence
surrounding the issues on September 1, 2017 and January 10, 2018 demonstrated
that the relationship is strained and it would be prudent for the police to
attend the unit with the Landlord in the future.  As I believe both the
Landlords and the Tenant equally, I do not find the Landlords proved on a
balance of probabilities the Tenant substantially interfered with their
reasonable enjoyment in those two incidents.
 
30.  
After considering all of the
evidence with respect to the refuse in the lane, I find that the Tenant has
failed to comply with the N5 Notice and did not clean up the materials and
garbage in the lane putting the Landlord at risk of being billed by the city,
thereby substantially interfering with the Landlord’s lawful right, interest or
privilege. However, this was a onetime incident and the issue is now resolved. 
I find it does not rise to the level to warrant termination of the tenancy and
a conditional order would be appropriate in the circumstances.  
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before February
28, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlords $3,822.26*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to February 2, 2018.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $24.66 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
February 3, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before February 28, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from March
1, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 28, 2018, then starting March 1, 2018, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlords, on or after March 1, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before February
28, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $4,719.00** to the Landlords or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March 1, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlords.
10.   If the Tenant complies with paragraph 8 of the
order then;
11.   The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant is denied on
the condition that:
 
a)    The Tenant shall refrain from accumulating garbage in and around the
property for a period of 12 months commencing February 2, 2018 and up to and
including February 1, 2019.  
12.   If the Tenant fails to comply with the conditions set out in
paragraph 11 above, then, within 30 days of the breach, the Landlord may apply
under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for
an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant.  The Landlord must
make the application within 30 days of a breach of a condition set out in
paragraph 11 of this order. 
13.   The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00
or the cost of filing the L2 application.

Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
File
Number: SWL-08112-17
File
Number: SWL-08113-17
KC and JC (the 'Landlords') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict JS (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes and because the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential
complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlords or another tenant.
This application was heard in Windsor on
January 17, 2018. The Landlords KC and JC, attended the hearing along with the
Landlords’ Legal Representative, LM. The Tenant attended the hearing and spoke
with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
Determinations:
L1 Application:
1.
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from September 1, 2017
to November 30, 2017. Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of
Termination effective September 16, 2017.
2.  The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
3.  The monthly rent is $761.00
4.  The Landlord is not holding a last month's rent deposit.
5.  The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
6.  The parties agree that the amount outstanding to January 31, 2018,
inclusive of rent arrears ($3,783.00), and costs ($175.00), is $3,985.00.
Section 82:
7.  The Tenant raises maintenance issues under section 82 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006. The Tenant testified she has lived in the rental unit
for 17 years and in 2015 she told the Landlord the furnace was not working.
According to the Tenant the furnace sits on cinder blocks under the house and
the gas company would not certify it for use. The Tenant said the furnace
needed to be installed on a cement pad.
8.  The Tenant said she used her wood stove for heat, but in mid-
December 2017 there was a fire in the chimney of the wood stove and the
Landlord did not fix it until January 13, 2018. The Tenant said she was
without heat for a month. The Tenant testified she used her oven and space
heaters to heat the unit.
9.  The Tenant said she had her own contractor attend to the chimney
stack, but it was still not working properly.
10. The Landlords said they purchased the property in March 2016 and
during their conversation with the Tenant, KC said the Tenant advised them she
preferred to use the wood stove as her source of heat and not to bother fixing
the furnace.
11. The Landlord, KC, testified that the first time they knew about the
heat situation was January 2, 2018 when they were contacted by the health
inspector. KC said the Tenant never contacted them about the problem. KC said
the rental unit was equipped with baseboard heaters when they purchased it, but
without their knowledge, the heaters have been removed.
12. KC said that when they found out there was no heat from the health
inspector they advised the Tenant they would attend the property on January 3,
2018, but when they attended they were denied access because they had not
provided 24 hour written notice. KC said they returned on January 5, 2018 with
the police after providing notice. According to KC they brought space heaters
for the Tenant.
13. KC said when they inspected the rental unit they found the furnace
had never been turned on so they have made arrangements to have a new furnace
installed.
14. Because there had been a fire in the chimney stack, the Tenant told
the Landlord she had the chimney cleaned but it was still a problem. KC said
they called chimney maintenance person to attend to the chimney but the weather
was not conducive to climbing onto the roof, so the first time the chimney
could be addressed was on January 13, 2018. KC said the fire was caused by the

furnace. JC said that if he had known it was going to be an issue, he would
have put a new furnace in right away. In any event, the Landlords said they
would install a new furnace right away and it is so ordered.
16. I have considered all the evidence raised by the Tenant under
section 82 and I find that the Tenant failed to advise the Landlords that there
was no heat and the Landlords only found out about the heat situation on
January 2, 2018 through the health unit. The Landlords acted quickly, but the
Tenant refused them entry when they attempted to attend the rental unit to
determine what needed to be done. Once the Landlords gained entry, the chimney
stack was cleaned as soon as weather permitted.
17. Although the furnace was not functioning, the Tenant relied on the
wood stove as a preferred source of heat. Given the lack of notice to the
Landlord about the heat issue, I do not find the Landlord is in breach of
section 20 or the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006. The Landlords acted
promptly once notified and are prepared to install a new furnace now that they
are aware that the Tenant needs one. In any event, the Tenant had heat once the
Landlords were allowed access and able to get on the roof. As of the date of
the hearing, the Tenant said she had heat. Therefore I find that under section
83 there are no serious outstanding maintenance issues in the rental unit and
termination of the tenancy should not be denied.
L2
Application:
18.
The Landlord served a first
N5 Notice to End Your Tenancy For Interfering with Others, Damages or
Overcrowding (N5) on September 15, 2017 because the Tenant allegedly left
garbage in the lane and the Tenant assaulted the Landlord, KC, when she went to
pick up rent.
19.
The Landlords said the
Tenant failed to clean up the lane, so didn’t void the first N5 Notice. I am
satisfied the Tenant didn’t void the first N5 Notice and the Landlord can
proceed with the L2 Application on the first N5 Notice.
Landlords’ Evidence
20.
KC said she received a
notice from the City of Windsor on August 31, 2017 because there was refuse in
the lane of the property and the notice directed the Landlord to clean up the
debris or they would be charged for the cleanup (Exhibit #1).
21.
On September 21, 2018 KC
said they went back to the property and cleaned up the refuse because the
Tenant had failed to adequately address the problem ( Exhibit #2).
22.
KC testified that when she
went to collect the rent on September 1, 2017, she brought paint the Tenant had
requested. However, KC said the Tenant was not satisfied with the type of
paint and refused to pay rent, then the Tenant pushed KC and KC stumbled
backwards. The Tenant then slammed the door in the Landlord’s face. KC said
she called police.
23.
KC stated she went home and
spoke with police about 7 or 8 pm. KC then said she attended the police
station to fill out a report. KC said she did not want the Tenant charged
because she did not want the Tenant to know where she lived.
24.
JC testified that he went to
the property on January 10, 2018 to discuss the furnace. The Tenant had
violation papers she said was from Union Gas about the furnace. JC said that
when he took the papers and attempted to leave to get copies, the Tenant
blocked the exit, pushed the Landlord and took the papers from him. JC said the
police were called by the Tenant and no charges were laid. JC said the police
advised him that he should bring the police every time he attended the rental
unit.
Tenant’s Evidence
25.
The Tenant didn’t deny that
she failed to clean up the lane after receiving the N5 Notice. The Tenant
stated she thought she had an arrangement with the Landlords that they would
clean up the refuse in the lane as she had no way of getting rid of all of the
materials. The Landlords denied they had any arrangement with the Tenant. The
Tenant said some of the items were hers, but some belonged to neighbours. In
any event, the Tenant said her belongings had been piled in the lane for about
eight months and she tried to clean up what she could but wasn’t able to get
rid of everything.
26.
On September 1, 2017, the
Tenant said the Landlord, KC, brought paint but it was the wrong kind of paint.
The Tenant testified the Landlord was standing on the porch and she shut slammed
the main door shut, but didn’t touch KC. The Tenant said she heard nothing
from the police.
27.
On January 10, 2018, the
Tenant testified the Landlord came to her rental unit and tried to take the
Union Gas violation notices. The Tenant said she was afraid the Landlord would
not bring the notices back to her, so she grabbed them from him. In the
process the Tenant said JC stepped on her foot which caused it to bruise.
28.
The Tenant said she called
police and no charges were laid even though she requested a peace bond and
assault charges. The Tenant said she suffers from anxiety and “flips out
sometimes”.
29.
I find that the evidence
surrounding the issues on September 1, 2017 and January 10, 2018 demonstrated
that the relationship is strained and it would be prudent for the police to
attend the unit with the Landlord in the future. As I believe both the
Landlords and the Tenant equally, I do not find the Landlords proved on a
balance of probabilities the Tenant substantially interfered with their
reasonable enjoyment in those two incidents.
30.
After considering all of the
evidence with respect to the refuse in the lane, I find that the Tenant has
failed to comply with the N5 Notice and did not clean up the materials and
garbage in the lane putting the Landlord at risk of being billed by the city,
thereby substantially interfering with the Landlord’s lawful right, interest or
privilege. However, this was a onetime incident and the issue is now resolved.
I find it does not rise to the level to warrant termination of the tenancy and
a conditional order would be appropriate in the circumstances.
It is ordered that:
1.
Unless the Tenant voids the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant is
terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before February
28, 2018.
2.
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlords $3,822.26*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to February 2, 2018.
3.
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $24.66 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
February 3, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before February 28, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March
1, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 28, 2018, then starting March 1, 2018, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlords, on or after March 1, 2018.
8.
If, on or before February
28, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $4,719.00** to the Landlords or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
9.
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March 1, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlords.
10. If the Tenant complies with paragraph 8 of the
order then;
11. The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant is denied on
the condition that:
a)  The Tenant shall refrain from accumulating garbage in and around the
property for a period of 12 months commencing February 2, 2018 and up to and
including February 1, 2019.
12. If the Tenant fails to comply with the conditions set out in
paragraph 11 above, then, within 30 days of the breach, the Landlord may apply
under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for
an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord must
make the application within 30 days of a breach of a condition set out in
paragraph 11 of this order.
13. The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00
or the cost of filing the L2 application.

This application was heard in Windsor on January 17, 2018. The Landlords KC and JC, attended the hearing along with the Landlords’ Legal Representative, LM. The Tenant attended the hearing and spoke with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing. Determinations: L1 Application: 1. The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from September 1, 2017 to November 30, 2017. Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective September 16, 2017. 2.  The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit. 3.  The monthly rent is $761.00 4.  The Landlord is not holding a last month's rent deposit. 5.  The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed. 6.  The parties agree that the amount outstanding to January 31, 2018, inclusive of rent arrears ($3,783.00), and costs ($175.00), is $3,985.00. Section 82: 7.  The Tenant raises maintenance issues under section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006. The Tenant testified she has lived in the rental unit for 17 years and in 2015 she told the Landlord the furnace was not working. According to the Tenant the furnace sits on cinder blocks under the house and the gas company would not certify it for use. The Tenant said the furnace needed to be installed on a cement pad. 8.  The Tenant said she used her wood stove for heat, but in mid- December 2017 there was a fire in the chimney of the wood stove and the Landlord did not fix it until January 13, 2018. The Tenant said she was without heat for a month. The Tenant testified she used her oven and space heaters to heat the unit. 9.  The Tenant said she had her own contractor attend to the chimney stack, but it was still not working properly. 10. The Landlords said they purchased the property in March 2016 and during their conversation with the Tenant, KC said the Tenant advised them she preferred to use the wood stove as her source of heat and not to bother fixing the furnace. 11. The Landlord, KC, testified that the first time they knew about the heat situation was January 2, 2018 when they were contacted by the health inspector. KC said the Tenant never contacted them about the problem. KC said the rental unit was equipped with baseboard heaters when they purchased it, but without their knowledge, the heaters have been removed. 12. KC said that when they found out there was no heat from the health inspector they advised the Tenant they would attend the property on January 3, 2018, but when they attended they were denied access because they had not provided 24 hour written notice. KC said they returned on January 5, 2018 with the police after providing notice. According to KC they brought space heaters for the Tenant. 13. KC said when they inspected the rental unit they found the furnace had never been turned on so they have made arrangements to have a new furnace installed. 14. Because there had been a fire in the chimney stack, the Tenant told the Landlord she had the chimney cleaned but it was still a problem. KC said they called chimney maintenance person to attend to the chimney but the weather was not conducive to climbing onto the roof, so the first time the chimney could be addressed was on January 13, 2018. KC said the fire was caused by the Tenant burning garbage and soft wood which clogged up the chimney. 15. JC testified that when he spoke with the Tenant she advised him she preferred to use the stove for heat that is why they didn’t replace the furnace. JC said that if he had known it was going to be an issue, he would have put a new furnace in right away. In any event, the Landlords said they would install a new furnace right away and it is so ordered. 16. I have considered all the evidence raised by the Tenant under section 82 and I find that the Tenant failed to advise the Landlords that there was no heat and the Landlords only found out about the heat situation on January 2, 2018 through the health unit. The Landlords acted quickly, but the Tenant refused them entry when they attempted to attend the rental unit to determine what needed to be done. Once the Landlords gained entry, the chimney stack was cleaned as soon as weather permitted. 17. Although the furnace was not functioning, the Tenant relied on the wood stove as a preferred source of heat. Given the lack of notice to the Landlord about the heat issue, I do not find the Landlord is in breach of section 20 or the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006. The Landlords acted promptly once notified and are prepared to install a new furnace now that they are aware that the Tenant needs one. In any event, the Tenant had heat once the Landlords were allowed access and able to get on the roof. As of the date of the hearing, the Tenant said she had heat. Therefore I find that under section 83 there are no serious outstanding maintenance issues in the rental unit and termination of the tenancy should not be denied. L2 Application: 18. The Landlord served a first N5 Notice to End Your Tenancy For Interfering with Others, Damages or Overcrowding (N5) on September 15, 2017 because the Tenant allegedly left garbage in the lane and the Tenant assaulted the Landlord, KC, when she went to pick up rent. 19. The Landlords said the Tenant failed to clean up the lane, so didn’t void the first N5 Notice. I am satisfied the Tenant didn’t void the first N5 Notice and the Landlord can proceed with the L2 Application on the first N5 Notice. Landlords’ Evidence 20. KC said she received a notice from the City of Windsor on August 31, 2017 because there was refuse in the lane of the property and the notice directed the Landlord to clean up the debris or they would be charged for the cleanup (Exhibit #1). 21. On September 21, 2018 KC said they went back to the property and cleaned up the refuse because the Tenant had failed to adequately address the problem ( Exhibit #2). 22. KC testified that when she went to collect the rent on September 1, 2017, she brought paint the Tenant had requested. However, KC said the Tenant was not satisfied with the type of paint and refused to pay rent, then the Tenant pushed KC and KC stumbled backwards. The Tenant then slammed the door in the Landlord’s face. KC said she called police. 23. KC stated she went home and spoke with police about 7 or 8 pm. KC then said she attended the police station to fill out a report. KC said she did not want the Tenant charged because she did not want the Tenant to know where she lived. 24. JC testified that he went to the property on January 10, 2018 to discuss the furnace. The Tenant had violation papers she said was from Union Gas about the furnace. JC said that when he took the papers and attempted to leave to get copies, the Tenant blocked the exit, pushed the Landlord and took the papers from him. JC said the police were called by the Tenant and no charges were laid. JC said the police advised him that he should bring the police every time he attended the rental unit. Tenant’s Evidence 25. The Tenant didn’t deny that she failed to clean up the lane after receiving the N5 Notice. The Tenant stated she thought she had an arrangement with the Landlords that they would clean up the refuse in the lane as she had no way of getting rid of all of the materials. The Landlords denied they had any arrangement with the Tenant. The Tenant said some of the items were hers, but some belonged to neighbours. In any event, the Tenant said her belongings had been piled in the lane for about eight months and she tried to clean up what she could but wasn’t able to get rid of everything. 26. On September 1, 2017, the Tenant said the Landlord, KC, brought paint but it was the wrong kind of paint. The Tenant testified the Landlord was standing on the porch and she shut slammed the main door shut, but didn’t touch KC. The Tenant said she heard nothing from the police. 27. On January 10, 2018, the Tenant testified the Landlord came to her rental unit and tried to take the Union Gas violation notices. The Tenant said she was afraid the Landlord would not bring the notices back to her, so she grabbed them from him. In the process the Tenant said JC stepped on her foot which caused it to bruise. 28. The Tenant said she called police and no charges were laid even though she requested a peace bond and assault charges. The Tenant said she suffers from anxiety and “flips out sometimes”. 29. I find that the evidence surrounding the issues on September 1, 2017 and January 10, 2018 demonstrated that the relationship is strained and it would be prudent for the police to attend the unit with the Landlord in the future. As I believe both the Landlords and the Tenant equally, I do not find the Landlords proved on a balance of probabilities the Tenant substantially interfered with their reasonable enjoyment in those two incidents. 30. After considering all of the evidence with respect to the refuse in the lane, I find that the Tenant has failed to comply with the N5 Notice and did not clean up the materials and garbage in the lane putting the Landlord at risk of being billed by the city, thereby substantially interfering with the Landlord’s lawful right, interest or privilege. However, this was a onetime incident and the issue is now resolved. I find it does not rise to the level to warrant termination of the tenancy and a conditional order would be appropriate in the circumstances. It is ordered that: 1. Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before February 28, 2018. 2. The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $3,822.26*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February 2, 2018. 3. The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $24.66 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 3, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit. 4. The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $175.00 for the cost of filing the application. 5. If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before February 28, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding. 6. If the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2018, then starting March 1, 2018, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced. 7. Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after March 1, 2018. 8. If, on or before February 28, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $4,719.00** to the Landlords or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced. 9. The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March 1, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords. 10. If the Tenant complies with paragraph 8 of the order then; 11. The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant is denied on the condition that: a)  The Tenant shall refrain from accumulating garbage in and around the property for a period of 12 months commencing February 2, 2018 and up to and including February 1, 2019. 12. If the Tenant fails to comply with the conditions set out in paragraph 11 above, then, within 30 days of the breach, the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a breach of a condition set out in paragraph 11 of this order. 13. The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 or the cost of filing the L2 application.

S.J. and A.J. (the 'Landlords') applied for
an order to terminate the tenancy and evict S.B. (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in
the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another
tenant; and because the Tenant or another occupant of the rental unit has
committed an illegal act or has carried out, or permitted someone to carry out
an illegal trade, business or occupation in the rental unit or the residential
complex. The Landlord has also applied for an order for compensation for undue
damage the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit
after the termination date.
 
The Tenant then applied for an order
determining that the Landlord or the Landlord's agent harassed,
obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with the Tenant, entered the
rental unit illegally, altered the locking system on a door giving entry to the
rental unit or residential complex without giving the Tenant replacement keys
and substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit
or residential complex by the Tenant or by a member of the Tenant's household.
 
These applications were heard together in
Toronto on May 30, 2018.
 
The first-named Landlord
above (the ‘Landlord’) and the Tenant’s agent, M.M. (the ‘Tenant’s Agent’),
attended the hearing. The Landlords were represented by A.V.. The Tenant was
represented by M.P. 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
This application involves a
condominium apartment. The Landlords allege the Tenant never lived in the
rental unit; rather, he turned it into an airbnb unit which was then rented out
dozens if not hundreds of times to travellers as if it was a hotel room. It is
the Landlords’ position that this activity caused excessive and undue damage to
the rental unit which is recoverable under s. 89(1) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). 
2.     
The Tenant argues that the
Board lacks the jurisdiction to consider the Landlords’ claim because the
application was amended to include it after the Tenant moved out. In the
alternative, the Tenant argues the Landlords’ evidence is insufficient to
establish that the alleged damage occurred prior to the Tenant returning vacant
possession to the Landlords. In the further alternative, the Tenant argues the
damage the Landlords claim is as a result of ordinary wear and tear and not
undue.
PRELIMINARY
ISSUES
3.     
At the beginning of the
hearing I raised a preliminary issue with respect to the Tenant’s application.
It is electronically signed by the Tenant’s Agent and not by the Tenant. In
response to my questions I learned the Tenant’s Agent is not a licensee under
the Law Society Act nor does she hold a power of attorney for property
for the Tenant. 
4.     
The reason this is an issue
is because s. 185 of the Act says:
(1)  An
application shall be filed with the Board in the form approved by the Board,
shall be accompanied by the prescribed information and shall be signed by
the applicant.  
(2)  An
applicant may give written authorization to sign an application to a person
representing the applicant under the authority of the Law Society Act
and, if the applicant does so, the Board may require such representative to
file a copy of the authorization.
[Emphasis
added.]
5.     
Pursuant to s. 59 of Ontario
Regulation 516/06, an application that is electronic filed is signed by the
applicant by typing his or her name in the space provided. 
6.     
As can be seen from the
wording of s. 185, an application must be signed by the applicant or by someone
representing the applicant under the authority of the Law Society Act.
As a valid power of attorney for property gives the attorney the legal
authority to deal with the donor’s financial affairs, an attorney may also sign
an application. Where an application is signed by a lawyer or paralegal the
Board may require the representative to file with the Board written
authorization signed by the applicant that permits the lawyer or paralegal to
act. 
7.     
The clear and obvious
purpose of this provision is to ensure that the named applicant is truly the
driving force behind the claim being asserted and the Board and the respondent
can rest assured the applicant can rightly be held responsible for the conduct
of the litigation. 
8.     
This is of particular
concern in a case like this where the applicant does not attend the hearing of
the application. Where the applicant is present, the applicant can endorse the
application on the record and the requirements of the Act and the purpose of
the provision are met. Where the applicant is not present, the application can
be adjourned so he or she can attend or file and serve an amended application. 
9.     
After inviting submissions
on the issue the Tenant’s representative did not seek to adjourn the application
so it was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
10.   The second preliminary issue that arose at the
beginning of the hearing concerns the Landlords’ application brought pursuant
to s. 69 of the Act. 
11.   After some discussion the Landlords sought the
consent of the Board to withdraw their request for an order terminating the
tenancy. I believe this request is motivated by a desire on the part of the
Landlords to leave open the possibility of pursuing prospective rent in another
forum. As this application is not an application for arrears of rent, I granted
the Landlords’ request without prejudice pursuant to s. 200(4) of the Act. 
12.   The third preliminary issue that was argued
before me was actually raised by the Tenant’s representative at the very end of
the hearing. 
13.   The Tenant argues that the Board lacks
jurisdiction to hear the Tenant’s claim made by way of s. 89(1) of the Act
because the application was filed after the Tenant ceased to be in possession of
the rental unit. This assertion on the part of the Tenant is actually not true
but deserves some explanation. 
14.   Subsection 89(1) says:
A landlord may
apply to the Board for an order requiring a tenant to pay reasonable costs that
the landlord has incurred or will incur for the repair of or, where repairing
is not reasonable, the replacement of damaged property, if the tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or a person whom the tenant permits in the
residential complex wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to the rental
unit or the residential complex and the tenant is in possession of the
rental unit.  
[Emphasis
added.]
15.   This limitation on a landlord’s ability to apply
to the Board for a monetary remedy is echoed in sections 87 (for rent arrears)
and section 90 (for payment of rent due as a result of a misrepresentation of
income in a rent-geared-to-income situation). The Board’s jurisdiction over
such claims is split with that of the regular court system. A landlord can
apply to the Board for a monetary remedy while a tenant is still in possession
but after the tenant moves out and returns vacant possession to the landlord the
claim must be asserted elsewhere. 
16.   The difficulty with the Tenant’s argument is
that the Landlords filed this application with the Board on December 4, 2017,
well before the Landlords went back into possession at the end of February,
2018. The application filed on December 4, 2017 includes a claim made pursuant
to s. 89(1).
17.   I believe the reason this is even an issue is
because on March 14, 2018, the Landlords filed a request to amend the
application to increase the damage claim from $370.00 to $10,545.53. In other
words, what the Tenant is really trying to argue is that the Board should not
grant the Landlords’ request to amend the application because it was filed with
the Board after the Tenant moved out. 
18.   There is nothing in the Act or the Board’s Rules
of Practice to support this argument. 
19.   Pursuant to s. 200(1) an applicant may amend an
application to the Board in accordance with the Rules. 
20.   Rule 16 is the applicable Rule. The relevant
parts of Rule 16 read as follows:
16.1 An
applicant who wishes to amend the application before the hearing shall: 
a.         file the written request for the amendment and
an amended application;
b.         give a copy of the documents to all other
parties;
c.         file a certificate of service for the request
and the amended application.
16.2 When an
applicant files a request to amend an application, LTB staff will process the
amended application and, if necessary, issue a new Notice of Hearing. The
decision about whether or not to grant the requested amendment will be made by
an LTB Member.  
…
16.4 The LTB
shall decide whether to permit an amendment taking into consideration the
following factors: 
a.         whether
the amendment was requested as soon as the need for it was known, if that was
important in the circumstances;
b.         any prejudice a party may experience as a result
of the amendment;
c.         whether
the amendment is significant enough to warrant any delay that may be caused by
the amendment;
d.         whether
the amendment is necessary and was requested in good faith; and
e.         any other relevant factors.
21.   There is no question here that the Landlords
complied with Rule 16.1. 
22.   Rule 16.2 specifically requires that a Board
Member consider and then grant or deny any requested amendments. In practice,
where a requested amendment is necessary and relevant, and the respondent
receives ample notice, the Board impliedly grants amendments at the beginning
of a hearing without explicit comment or inviting further submissions. 
23.   In fact landlord’s applications for termination
for arrears of rent are amended every day at the Board as a matter of course
when a tenant has moved out after the application was filed. The application is
converted from one governed by s. 74 to one filed under s. 87 even though an
application cannot be filed under s. 87 once a tenant has gone out of
possession. 
24.   So where a party wishes to challenge a request
to amend it should be done at the very beginning of the hearing and not at the
end after all of the evidence was heard as was the case here. 
25.   Nevertheless, even if the Tenant had objected to
the amendment request at the start of the hearing, the Landlords’ request to
amend would still have been granted. This is because the amendment is timely, necessary,
and the Tenant has been given ample notice of the additional monetary claims
being made.  
26.   It is necessary because the Landlords say they
discovered additional damage after the Landlords went back into possession which
was after the application was filed. It was filed and served less than three
weeks after the Landlords went back into possession so it was timely. Finally,
the request to amend was filed and served on the Tenant two and a half months
prior to the hearing before me so it cannot be said the Tenant was unfairly
prejudiced as a result of the amendment. 
27.   I would also observe that if the Board did not
grant the amendment requested then because of the common law doctrine of issue
estoppel the Landlords almost certainly would have had to withdraw the application
before the Board and assert the claim anew in Small Claims Court. That would
result in additional costs for both parties and be wasteful of adjudicative and
staff resources due to unnecessary duplication. 
28.   Given all of the above, I am satisfied the Board
has the jurisdiction to grant the request to amend and the request is granted.
The Board has the jurisdiction to consider the claims asserted. 
THE LANDLORDS’
CLAIM UNDER S. 89(1)
29.   As a result of all of the above, the only real
issues before the Board are with respect to the Landlords’ damage claim under
s. 89(1) of the Act. 
30.   As can be seen from the wording of the provision,
s. 89(1) claims require the Board to explore:
•       
The nature of the damage (is
it undue or normal wear and tear);
•       
How the damage occurred (was
it a result of negligence or wilful conduct);
•       
Whether or not the damaged
property can reasonably be repaired; and
•       
The reasonable cost of
repair, or replacement where repair is not a reasonable option.
31.   Despite this relatively narrow focus for the
inquiry on this application, the Landlords were permitted on cross-examination
of the Tenant’s Agent to ask questions about the tenancy itself in order in
part to explore the cause of the alleged damage but also because they take the
position the Tenant’s Agent is not a credible witness.
Findings of
Fact 
32.   The Landlords bought this condominium unit in
2016. The Landlord says at the time they purchased it the unit was spotless. It
had been rented out for the three years prior to their purchase. 
33.   Immediately after buying the unit the Landlords’
real estate agent negotiated the tenancy agreement with the Tenant’s real
estate agent. The Landlords were not personally involved and did not meet the
Tenant. As far as they were aware, the Tenant is an accountant who works for a
property management company that shall be referred to here as ZP. The tenancy
commenced May 1, 2016.
34.   In 2017 the Landlords discovered the rental unit
was listed on the airbnb website as a home share available for short term
rentals without their knowledge or consent. 
35.   Airbnb records indicate it was only one of
multiple units being offered by a host named “Sofia”. The Landlords do not know
“Sofia”. In an investigative article done by CBC News, “Sofia” is quoted as
saying she works for ZP. 
36.   The Tenant’s Agent says she is a property
manager who works for ZP. She says she knows “Sofia” but she is not an employee
of ZP. Rather, “Sofia” is a contractor who does some work with ZP. After the
CBC News article appeared, the Tenant’s Agent says “Sofia” was spoken to about
her misrepresentation.
37.   The Tenant’s Agent also says the Tenant does not
work for ZP. Rather he is employed by a gas station that is owned by AN who is
the owner of ZP. 
38.   She says that she started working for ZP in
September of 2017 and she never met or spoke with the Tenant until November of
2017. She says she overheard people in her office discussing the Landlords’
behaviour towards the Tenant when they discovered the unit was being rented out
through airbnb as a home share. She says that at the time the Tenant was in
India so she decided to help him out. 
39.   When the Landlords found out something was going
on with the unit they attempted to contact the Tenant and served notice of
entry. 
40.   On November 7, 2017, the Tenant’s Agent sent an
e-mail to the Landlords describing herself as a property manager with ZP. In
the e-mail she states the Tenant is her “client”. 
41.   The Tenant’s Agent says that was a mistake. The
Tenant was never a client of ZP. She was just helping him out on her own time. 
42.   The e-mail the Tenant’s Agent sent on November
7, 2017 concerns the Landlords’ obligation to provide proper notice of
termination if they wish to end the tenancy, and then states:
A
representative of [ZP] will be at the above location today, November 7, 2017,
between the hours of 7:00pm-8:00pm, for the purpose of inspection of the unit. 
43.   After that the unit was inspected, the Landlords
met the Tenant’s Agent, and notices of termination were served on the Tenant.
44.   During one of the inspections the Landlords
discovered cleaning records. They are the type of dated and signed charts that
can often be seen in public washrooms. The charts have a list of cleaning
chores on one side, dates at the top of columns that are to be initialed by a
cleaner, and checkmarks to indicate the tasks have been performed. The
Landlords took photographs of these records that are entered into evidence. The
cleaners appear to have been there frequently. At some times it was every
couple of days. 
45.   On December 4, 2017, the Tenant’s application
was filed by the Board. As stated above, it was not filed by the Tenant, but by
the Tenant’s Agent. The filing fee was charged to a credit card belonging to
AN, the owner of ZP. 
46.   The Tenant’s Agent says this was also a mistake.
She is used to filing applications with the Board and charging the filing fee
to her employer in the course of her work so she just did what she normally
does. But ZP has nothing to do with the tenancy or the Tenant’s application.
She was just helping the Tenant out as a favour. 
47.   On the evening of February 26, 2018, the unit
was emptied by movers. The Tenant’s Agent was present and took photographs
which were entered into evidence. She says it is her practice in her job to
take photographs after a tenant moves out so she did it this time too, even
though she was merely helping the Tenant out on her own time. 
48.   During the course of the testimony in chief of
the Tenant’s Agent, the Tenant’s representative showed her a set of
photographs. She initially stated those photographs were taken by her. She then
corrected herself and said the photographs were given to her by the Tenant. The
photographs in question include the ones that appear on the airbnb website to
advertise the unit. 
49.   One of the items of damage the Landlords are
claiming is with respect to two knobs on the stove top that were broken off. 
50.   The Tenant’s Agent says that when the movers
were finished moving out items from the unit and the keys returned to the
concierge, the stove knobs were in perfect working order. They were not broken.
She says her photographs of the stove show that. That is not true. In her
photographs of the stove top, it is possible to see that the top two knobs on
the stove top are broken. They were put back in place before the photographs
were taken, but the cracks in them where they are broken can still be seen.
When this was pointed out to the Tenant’s Agent on cross-examination, she
persisted in stating the knobs were not broken when vacant possession was
returned to the Landlords.
51.   Finally, the Landlords filed into evidence
photographs downloaded from the web site belonging to ZP. They include
photographs of a distinctive lamp and clock that were sitting on a side table
in the Tenant’s bedroom and a similarly distinctive wall decoration that was
hanging above the sofa in the living room. In other words, ZP’s own web site
shows photographs that appear to have been taken of the rental unit. When this
was pointed out to her the Tenant’s Agent stated she had no idea why this was
the case, she has nothing to do with her employer’s web site, but she is aware
that it is currently being updated. 
52.   Given all of the above, I am satisfied that the
Tenant’s Agent is not a credible witness. Her testimony about the broken stove
top knobs is demonstrably untrue. The e-mail of November 7, 2017, the filing of
the Tenant’s application and the manner in which the filing fee was paid, the
behaviour of the Tenant’s Agent in attending at the unit for the Landlords’
inspection and for the move, and the photographs entered into evidence, all
support the conclusion that the Tenant’s Agent is not telling the truth when
she says she did all of it as a favour for the Tenant. 
53.   As a result, where the testimony of the Tenant’s
Agent with respect to the damage to the rental unit conflicts with the evidence
and testimony of the Landlord, I accept the Landlords’ evidence over that of
the Tenant. This means that I do not accept the testimony of the Tenant’s Agent
to the effect that some of the damage claimed by the Landlords did not exist at
the time the Tenant’s Agent returned the key to the concierge. 
54.   The specific items of damage the Landlords claim
in the application concern: the carpeting; the hardwood flooring; the window
blinds; the silicone in the bathroom shower enclosure; the shower door; the
condition of painted surfaces; the stove knobs; and the lock for the door of
the rental unit. 
55.   With respect to the carpeting, the evidence
establishes the carpet in the bedroom was left badly stained. When the Landlords
regained possession they could not afford to replace the carpets and needed to
mitigate their damages by re-renting the unit as quickly as they could. So they
had the carpets professionally cleaned but the cleaning did not remove the
stains. 
56.   In the main living area of the unit there is
engineered hardwood flooring. Photographs entered into evidence show marks and
damage consistent with heavy items being dragged. There is also an area that
has some sort of build-up that cannot be removed. 
57.   Vertical blinds hang in the windows throughout
the unit that were fixtures rented with the unit. A number of the slats were
torn or otherwise damaged so that they could not be re-hung. 
58.   The silicone sealant in the walk in shower was
so significantly stained with mildew or some other type of mould that it could
not be removed with regular cleaning. One of the reviews of the unit on the
airbnb website complains of the mould. 
59.   The shower door was off its hinges or otherwise
not working properly.
60.   A number of the photographs entered into
evidence show that in various places throughout the unit the walls and other
painted surfaces were chipped, dented, or otherwise marked. 
61.   Two of the four knobs for the burners on the
stove top were broken. 
62.   The Landlords had the condominium corporation
change the lock to the rental unit out of concern that some of the airbnb
guests or other individuals might have kept keys.
Analysis 
63.   The Tenant argues that the damage the Landlords
complain of is in the nature of normal wear and tear and therefore is not
“undue”. It is his submission that over time and from normal non-negligent use,
painted finishes get dented and marked, floors get scuffed, carpets get worn
and things get spilled, the silicone in shower enclosures develops mildew,
doors come off hinges, and vertical blind slats fall out. 
64.   The Landlords argue that although some of the
damage is akin to normal wear and tear in kind, the degree or extent of the
damage is excessive and directly related to the negligent or wilful behaviour
of the Tenant in permitting the unit to be used as an airbnb home share without
the Landlords’ knowledge or consent.
65.   The use of the phrase “undue damage” indicates
that some damage to a rental unit is expected with everyday use. I would agree
with the Tenant that normal wear and tear is not undue and the Tenant cannot be
held liable to the Landlord for it. 
66.   That being said, I agree with the Landlord that
much of what is claimed here cannot be said to be the result of normal,
everyday use. Further, some of the damage is clearly associated with careless
or negligent behaviour or wilfulness. 
67.   For example, the two broken knobs on the stove
top did not get broken on their own. The damage is consistent only with someone
deliberately applying inappropriate force or carelessly misapplying force
because he or she did not know how to turn the knobs on or off properly. Absent
evidence from the Tenant as to how the knobs were actually damaged, I am
satisfied that the only reasonable explanation of the cause of the damage is wilful
or negligent conduct by the Tenant, an occupant or a guest.
68.   Although it is common for people to accidentally
spill things on a carpet, particularly in a dining room, it is still indicative
of carelessness. And when it does happen, the reasonably prudent tenant makes
efforts to immediately clean it up. That is what spot cleaning products are
for. But the typical user of an airbnb unit is not in the same position as the
reasonably prudent tenant. For an airbnb user, the unit is akin to a hotel
room. I would not expect the typical airbnb consumer to travel with cleaning
products and no evidence was led here that there were products in the unit available
for a traveller’s use. 
69.   The photographs of the bedroom carpet taken by
both parties show heavy staining that is consistent with multiple careless
spills of liquid that were not tended to or spot cleaned in a timely manner.
Although I do not have photographs of the carpet after it was cleaned I have no
reason to doubt the Landlord’s testimony that the carpets remain stained after
professional cleaning. 
70.   In other words, although it is normal for a
landlord to have to vacuum and clean carpets on turnover, it is not normal for
the carpets to be this badly stained after a tenancy of less than two years.
The damage to the carpets is excessive and therefore, I find it is undue. It is
also consistent with behaviour on the part of the Tenant’s guests that can only
be described as careless; there were repeated spills of liquids not properly attended
to or spot cleaned in a timely and reasonable manner. 
71.   The same analysis is equally applicable to the
wooden floors, the silicone in the shower enclosure, the vertical blinds, and
the painted surfaces. 
72.   The pictures of the wooden flooring are
consistent with heavy objects like suitcases being carelessly dragged across
them. Some sort of build-up is visible in pictures entered into evidence
consistent with someone spilling some sort of glue or plasticized product that
then set and hardened. 
73.   Mildew grows on silicone in showers but it takes
years to get to the state this shower was in unless it is not cleaned with
bleach based cleaners or there is a serious ventilation problem. No evidence
was led of a ventilation problem in this bathroom so I am satisfied that the
cleaning done during the tenancy was done in a negligent manner because proper
cleaning products were not used. 
74.   The pictures of the blinds show multiple
individual slats were damaged and could not be used. Most of the damage is to
the top of the slat where the piece connects with the frame but at least one is
split at the bottom. In the closed position, the blinds show clear gaps where
pieces are missing. 
75.   Again, with normal use, individual vertical
blind slats will get damaged from opening and closing. Again, the degree of the
damage will increase with the carelessness of the user. The number of broken
and damaged slats visible in the Landlords’ photographs is excessive given a
tenancy of less than two years and is more consistent with repeated instances
of careless and negligent use. 
76.   The photographs show chips in the painted
finishes, scuff marks, and stains. Some of that is normal and typical but the
degree and amount of those kinds of marks as shown in the photographs supports
the conclusion that the Tenant’s airbnb guests were repeatedly less than
careful about moving around the unit. 
77.   So with respect to the wooden floors, the
silicone in the shower enclosure, the blinds and the painted surfaces in the
unit, I am satisfied that some if not all of the damage is undue and caused in
part by carelessness or negligent use or neglect.  
78.   With respect to the shower door, no evidence was
led as to how the door came off its hinges and it was easily repaired. Given
the nature of how such doors work, and my experience of like similar cases
before the Board, this kind of problem is consistent with both normal use and
negligent use. As a result, absent additional evidence, I am not prepared to
make a finding that the damage was excessive or out of the ordinary or more
consistent with negligence then ordinary usage. So the claim with respect to
the shower door must be dismissed. The evidence is insufficient to establish
the damage is undue.
79.   The real difficulty that arises here is with
respect to assessing the quantum the Landlords are entitled to for the
reasonable cost of repair or replacement where repair is not reasonable. 
80.   The task is easiest with respect to the knobs
for the stove and the carpet.
81.   According to the invoices filed, the Landlords
were able to purchase replacement knobs on-line at $25.80 each plus shipping
and HST. For some unknown reason the invoice shows the Landlords purchased
three although the evidence indicates only two were broken. This price is
clearly a reasonable amount for replacement knobs so I am satisfied the
Landlords are entitled to an order for two-thirds of the invoice filed or
$74.83. The evidence is unclear what if any amount was incurred for labour
costs related to replacing the knobs so no amount shall be ordered for labour. 
82.   As stated above, I accept the Landlords’
evidence that the carpet cannot in fact be repaired as the stains cannot be
removed. As a result, the Landlords are entitled to the reasonable cost the
Landlords will incur for replacing the carpet. The fact the Landlords have not
yet replaced the carpet because they could not afford it but still managed to
re-rent the unit does not negate their entitlement to that amount. 
83.   I would observe at this point that the wording
of s. 89(1) indicates the Landlords are not entitled to both the reasonable
cost of repair and the reasonable cost of replacement. So the Landlords are not
entitled to an order for the cost of cleaning the carpet. 
84.   The Landlords provided a quote from their
contractor for future replacement of the carpet of $2,400.00 plus HST of 13%.
No evidence was led to suggest this is an unreasonable amount, and based on my
experience of like claims I am not prepared to say that it is so an order shall
issue requiring the Tenant to pay to the Landlord $2,431.20 for replacing the
carpet. 
85.   The Landlords paid $550.00 plus HST to remove
and replace the silicone in the shower enclosure. 
86.   As stated above, some staining of the silicone
would be expecting from normal prudent use and cleaning. In other words, some
of the damage is undue and some is not. As the Tenant can only be held
responsible for the part that is undue some apportionment of responsibility for
the cost of replacing the silicone is appropriate. 
87.   Given the photographs filed and my experience of
like similar cases before the Board I am of the view that about 80% of the
mildew damage caused is attributable to the Tenant’s behaviour in failing to
use appropriate cleaning products. As a result, the Tenant shall be ordered to
pay to the Landlords 80% of the cost of replacing the silicone or $445.72. 
88.   A similar apportionment exercise would be
appropriate with respect to the damage to the floors, the painted surfaces, and
the blinds. 
89.   I should observe at this point that the parties
provided me with dozens of photographs of the state of the unit at the end of
the tenancy. Without them it would have been impossible for the Board to assess
how much of the damage can be attributed to normal wear and tear and how much
is excessive or undue. 
90.   Having examined those pictures carefully, and
taking into account my experience of like similar cases, it seems to me that
80% of the damage to the flooring is undue, as is 40% of the damage to the
painted surfaces and 90% of the damage to the blinds. 
91.   The vertical blinds were repaired at a cost of
$450.00 plus HST and I am satisfied that is a reasonable amount. So an order
will issue requiring the Tenant to pay to the Landlord $364.68 for the undue
damage to the blinds. 
92.   With respect to the damage to the painted
surfaces, the Landlord paid $550.00 plus HST, but that amount included an
unknown amount for “adjust kitchen hardware etc” and no evidence was led as to
how much of the total was with respect to the painted surfaces and how much was
not. As a result, it is not possible to assess how much of that cost is attributable
to the undue damage caused by the negligent conduct of the Tenant, an occupant
or a guest. 
93.   That being said, I am satisfied some costs were
incurred by the Landlords as a result of undue damage to the painted surfaces,
so in the absence of sufficient evidence that would enable the Board to
quantify it, it would be appropriate to award a nominal amount which I fix at
$25.00. 
94.   With respect to the engineered wood flooring the
Landlords obtained a quote “to repair damaged hardwood floor in the living
room, or to replace if necessary” for $1,100.00 plus HST. Given my experience
of the cost to replace flooring of this kind this is a reasonable amount, so
the Tenant will be ordered to pay to the Landlords $891.44 which represents 80%
of the cost the Landlords will incur to repair the flooring. 
95.   That leaves the claim for compensation with
respect to the changing of the lock. 
96.   Although I can understand why the Landlords
changed the lock and can appreciate it was probably prudent to do so, there was
nothing wrong with the lock. It was not damaged or in a state of disrepair.
Subsection 89(1) only addresses actual damage to the rental unit or residential
complex. This amount is not recoverable under the Act.
Conclusion 
97.   Finally, the Landlords incurred costs of $175.00
for filing the application and are entitled to reimbursement of those costs.
98.   This order contains all of the reasons for the
decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.
It is ordered
that:
1.     
The Tenant’s application is
dismissed.
2.     
The Landlords’ application
filed pursuant to s. 69 is dismissed without prejudice. 
3.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlords $4,232.87 for compensation for undue damage.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
The total amount the Tenant
owes the Landlords under this order is $4,407.87.
6.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlords the full amount owing on or before August 4, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
August 5, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.

Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006

Numbers: HOL-02144-17
HOT-02146-17
S.J. and A.J. (the 'Landlords') applied for
an order to terminate the tenancy and evict S.B. (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in
the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another
tenant; and because the Tenant or another occupant of the rental unit has
committed an illegal act or has carried out, or permitted someone to carry out
an illegal trade, business or occupation in the rental unit or the residential
complex. The Landlord has also applied for an order for compensation for undue
damage the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit
after the termination date.
The Tenant then applied for an order
determining that the Landlord or the Landlord's agent harassed,
obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with the Tenant, entered the
rental unit illegally, altered the locking system on a door giving entry to the
rental unit or residential complex without giving the Tenant replacement keys
and substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit
or residential complex by the Tenant or by a member of the Tenant's household.
These applications were heard together in
Toronto on May 30, 2018.
The first-named Landlord
above (the ‘Landlord’) and the Tenant’s agent, M.M. (the ‘Tenant’s Agent’),
attended the hearing. The Landlords were represented by A.V.. The Tenant was
represented by M.P.
Determinations:
1.
This application involves a
condominium apartment. The Landlords allege the Tenant never lived in the
rental unit; rather, he turned it into an airbnb unit which was then rented out
dozens if not hundreds of times to travellers as if it was a hotel room. It is
the Landlords’ position that this activity caused excessive and undue damage to
the rental unit which is recoverable under s. 89(1) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).
2.
The Tenant argues that the
Board lacks the jurisdiction to consider the Landlords’ claim because the
application was amended to include it after the Tenant moved out. In the
alternative, the Tenant argues the Landlords’ evidence is insufficient to
establish that the alleged damage occurred prior to the Tenant returning vacant
possession to the Landlords. In the further alternative, the Tenant argues the
damage the Landlords claim is as a result of ordinary wear and tear and not
undue.
PRELIMINARY
ISSUES
3.
At the beginning of the
hearing I raised a preliminary issue with respect to the Tenant’s application.
It is electronically signed by the Tenant’s Agent and not by the Tenant. In
response to my questions I learned the Tenant’s Agent is not a licensee under
the Law Society Act nor does she hold a power of attorney for property
for the Tenant.
4.
The reason this is an issue
is because s. 185 of the Act says:
(1) An
application shall be filed with the Board in the form approved by the Board,
shall be accompanied by the prescribed information and shall be signed by
the applicant.
(2) An
applicant may give written authorization to sign an application to a person
representing the applicant under the authority of the Law Society Act
and, if the applicant does so, the Board may require such representative to
file a copy of the authorization.
[Emphasis
added.]
5.
Pursuant to s. 59 of Ontario
Regulation 516/06, an application that is electronic filed is signed by the
applicant by typing his or her name in the space provided.
6.
As can be seen from the
wording of s. 185, an application must be signed by the applicant or by someone
representing the applicant under the authority of the Law Society Act.
As a valid power of attorney for property gives the attorney the legal
authority to deal with the donor’s financial affairs, an attorney may also sign
an application. Where an application is signed by a lawyer or paralegal the
Board may require the representative to file with the Board written
authorization signed by the applicant that permits the lawyer or paralegal to
act.
7.
The clear and obvious
purpose of this provision is to ensure that the named applicant is truly the
driving force behind the claim being asserted and the Board and the respondent
can rest assured the applicant can rightly be held responsible for the conduct
of the litigation.
8.
This is of particular
concern in a case like this where the applicant does not attend the hearing of
the application. Where the applicant is present, the applicant can endorse the
application on the record and the requirements of the Act and the purpose of
the provision are met. Where the applicant is not present, the application can
be adjourned so he or she can attend or file and serve an amended application.
9.
After inviting submissions
on the issue the Tenant’s representative did not seek to adjourn the application
so it was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
10. The second preliminary issue that arose at the
beginning of the hearing concerns the Landlords’ application brought pursuant
to s. 69 of the Act.
11. After some discussion the Landlords sought the
consent of the Board to withdraw their request for an order terminating the
tenancy. I believe this request is motivated by a desire on the part of the
Landlords to leave open the possibility of pursuing prospective rent in another
forum. As this application is not an application for arrears of rent, I granted
the Landlords’ request without prejudice pursuant to s. 200(4) of the Act.
12. The third preliminary issue that was argued
before me was actually raised by the Tenant’s representative at the very end of
the hearing.
13. The Tenant argues that the Board lacks
jurisdiction to hear the Tenant’s claim made by way of s. 89(1) of the Act
because the application was filed after the Tenant ceased to be in possession of
the rental unit. This assertion on the part of the Tenant is actually not true
but deserves some explanation.
14. Subsection 89(1) says:
A landlord may
apply to the Board for an order requiring a tenant to pay reasonable costs that
the landlord has incurred or will incur for the repair of or, where repairing
is not reasonable, the replacement of damaged property, if the tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or a person whom the tenant permits in the
residential complex wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to the rental
unit or the residential complex and the tenant is in possession of the
rental unit.
[Emphasis
added.]
15. This limitation on a landlord’s ability to apply
to the Board for a monetary remedy is echoed in sections 87 (for rent arrears)
and section 90 (for payment of rent due as a result of a misrepresentation of
income in a rent-geared-to-income situation). The Board’s jurisdiction over
such claims is split with that of the regular court system. A landlord can
apply to the Board for a monetary remedy while a tenant is still in possession
but after the tenant moves out and returns vacant possession to the landlord the
claim must be asserted elsewhere.
16. The difficulty with the Tenant’s argument is
that the Landlords filed this application with the Board on December 4, 2017,
well before the Landlords went back into possession at the end of February,
2018. The application filed on December 4, 2017 includes a claim made pursuant
to s. 89(1).
17. I believe the reason this is even an issue is
because on March 14, 2018, the Landlords filed a request to amend the
application to increase the damage claim from $370.00 to $10,545.53. In other
words, what the Tenant is really trying to argue is that the Board should not
grant the Landlords’ request to amend the application because it was filed with
the Board after the Tenant moved out.
18. There is nothing in the Act or the Board’s Rules
of Practice to support this argument.
19. Pursuant to s. 200(1) an applicant may amend an
application to the Board in accordance with the Rules.
20. Rule 16 is the applicable Rule. The relevant
parts of Rule 16 read as follows:
16.1 An
applicant who wishes to amend the application before the hearing shall:
a.   file the written request for the amendment and
an amended application;
b.   give a copy of the documents to all other
parties;
c.   file a certificate of service for the request
and the amended application.
16.2 When an
applicant files a request to amend an application, LTB staff will process the
amended application and, if necessary, issue a new Notice of Hearing. The
decision about whether or not to grant the requested amendment will be made by
an LTB Member.
…
16.4 The LTB
shall decide whether to permit an amendment taking into consideration the
following factors:
a.   whether
the amendment was requested as soon as the need for it was known, if that was
important in the circumstances;
b.   any prejudice a party may experience as a result
of the amendment;
c.   whether
the amendment is significant enough to warrant any delay that may be caused by
the amendment;
d.   whether
the amendment is necessary and was requested in good faith; and
e.   any other relevant factors.
21. There is no question here that the Landlords
complied with Rule 16.1.
22. Rule 16.2 specifically requires that a Board
Member consider and then grant or deny any requested amendments. In practice,
where a requested amendment is necessary and relevant, and the respondent
receives ample notice, the Board impliedly grants amendments at the beginning
of a hearing without explicit comment or inviting further submissions.
23. In fact landlord’s applications for termination
for arrears of rent are amended every day at the Board as a matter of course
when a tenant has moved out after the application was filed. The application is
converted from one governed by s. 74 to one filed under s. 87 even though an
application cannot be filed under s. 87 once a tenant has gone out of
possession.
24. So where a party wishes to challenge a request
to amend it should be done at the very beginning of the hearing and not at the
end after all of the evidence was heard as was the case here.
25. Nevertheless, even if the Tenant had objected to
the amendment request at the start of the hearing, the Landlords’ request to
amend would still have been granted. This is because the amendment is timely, necessary,
and the Tenant has been given ample notice of the additional monetary claims
being made.
26. It is necessary because the Landlords say they
discovered additional damage after the Landlords went back into possession which
was after the application was filed. It was filed and served less than three
weeks after the Landlords went back into possession so it was timely. Finally,
the request to amend was filed and served on the Tenant two and a half months
prior to the hearing before me so it cannot be said the Tenant was unfairly
prejudiced as a result of the amendment.
27. I would also observe that if the Board did not
grant the amendment requested then because of the common law doctrine of issue
estoppel the Landlords almost certainly would have had to withdraw the application
before the Board and assert the claim anew in Small Claims Court. That would
result in additional costs for both parties and be wasteful of adjudicative and
staff resources due to unnecessary duplication.
28. Given all of the above, I am satisfied the Board
has the jurisdiction to grant the request to amend and the request is granted.
The Board has the jurisdiction to consider the claims asserted.
THE LANDLORDS’
CLAIM UNDER S. 89(1)
29. As a result of all of the above, the only real
issues before the Board are with respect to the Landlords’ damage claim under
s. 89(1) of the Act.
30. As can be seen from the wording of the provision,
s. 89(1) claims require the Board to explore:
•
The nature of the damage (is
it undue or normal wear and tear);
•
How the damage occurred (was
it a result of negligence or wilful conduct);
•
Whether or not the damaged
property can reasonably be repaired; and
•
The reasonable cost of
repair, or replacement where repair is not a reasonable option.
31. Despite this relatively narrow focus for the
inquiry on this application, the Landlords were permitted on cross-examination
of the Tenant’s Agent to ask questions about the tenancy itself in order in
part to explore the cause of the alleged damage but also because they take the
position the Tenant’s Agent is not a credible witness.
Findings of
Fact
32. The Landlords bought this condominium unit in
2016. The Landlord says at the time they purchased it the unit was spotless. It
had been rented out for the three years prior to their purchase.
33. Immediately after buying the unit the Landlords’
real estate agent negotiated the tenancy agreement with the Tenant’s real
estate agent. The Landlords were not personally involved and did not meet the
Tenant. As far as they were aware, the Tenant is an accountant who works for a
property management company that shall be referred to here as ZP. The tenancy
commenced May 1, 2016.
34. In 2017 the Landlords discovered the rental unit
was listed on the airbnb website as a home share available for short term
rentals without their knowledge or consent.
35. Airbnb records indicate it was only one of
multiple units being offered by a host named “Sofia”. The Landlords do not know
“Sofia”. In an investigative article done by CBC News, “Sofia” is quoted as
saying she works for ZP.
36. The Tenant’s Agent says she is a property
manager who works for ZP. She says she knows “Sofia” but she is not an employee
of ZP. Rather, “Sofia” is a contractor who does some work with ZP. After the
CBC News article appeared, the Tenant’s Agent says “Sofia” was spoken to about
her misrepresentation.
37. The Tenant’s Agent also says the Tenant does not
work for ZP. Rather he is employed by a gas station that is owned by AN who is
the owner of ZP.
38. She says that she started working for ZP in
September of 2017 and she never met or spoke with the Tenant until November of
2017. She says she overheard people in her office discussing the Landlords’
behaviour towards the Tenant when they discovered the unit was being rented out
through airbnb as a home share. She says that at the time the Tenant was in
India so she decided to help him out.
39. When the Landlords found out something was going
on with the unit they attempted to contact the Tenant and served notice of
entry.
40. On November 7, 2017, the Tenant’s Agent sent an
e-mail to the Landlords describing herself as a property manager with ZP. In
the e-mail she states the Tenant is her “client”.
41. The Tenant’s Agent says that was a mistake. The
Tenant was never a client of ZP. She was just helping him out on her own time.
42. The e-mail the Tenant’s Agent sent on November
7, 2017 concerns the Landlords’ obligation to provide proper notice of
termination if they wish to end the tenancy, and then states:
A
representative of [ZP] will be at the above location today, November 7, 2017,
between the hours of 7:00pm-8:00pm, for the purpose of inspection of the unit.
43. After that the unit was inspected, the Landlords
met the Tenant’s Agent, and notices of termination were served on the Tenant.
44. During one of the inspections the Landlords
discovered cleaning records. They are the type of dated and signed charts that
can often be seen in public washrooms. The charts have a list of cleaning
chores on one side, dates at the top of columns that are to be initialed by a
cleaner, and checkmarks to indicate the tasks have been performed. The
Landlords took photographs of these records that are entered into evidence. The
cleaners appear to have been there frequently. At some times it was every
couple of days.
45. On December 4, 2017, the Tenant’s application
was filed by the Board. As stated above, it was not filed by the Tenant, but by
the Tenant’s Agent. The filing fee was charged to a credit card belonging to
AN, the owner of ZP.
46. The Tenant’s Agent says this was also a mistake.
She is used to filing applications with the Board and charging the filing fee
to her employer in the course of her work so she just did what she normally
does. But ZP has nothing to do with the tenancy or the Tenant’s application.
She was just helping the Tenant out as a favour.
47. On the evening of February 26, 2018, the unit
was emptied by movers. The Tenant’s Agent was present and took photographs
which were entered into evidence. She says it is her practice in her job to
take photographs after a tenant moves out so she did it this time too, even
though she was merely helping the Tenant out on her own time.
48. During the course of the testimony in chief of
the Tenant’s Agent, the Tenant’s representative showed her a set of
photographs. She initially stated those photographs were taken by her. She then
corrected herself and said the photographs were given to her by the Tenant. The
photographs in question include the ones that appear on the airbnb website to
advertise the unit.
49. One of the items of damage the Landlords are
claiming is with respect to two knobs on the stove top that were broken off.
50. The Tenant’s Agent says that when the movers
were finished moving out items from the unit and the keys returned to the
concierge, the stove knobs were in perfect working order. They were not broken.
She says her photographs of the stove show that. That is not true. In her
photographs of the stove top, it is possible to see that the top two knobs on
the stove top are broken. They were put back in place before the photographs
were taken, but the cracks in them where they are broken can still be seen.
When this was pointed out to the Tenant’s Agent on cross-examination, she
persisted in stating the knobs were not broken when vacant possession was
returned to the Landlords.
51. Finally, the Landlords filed into evidence
photographs downloaded from the web site belonging to ZP. They include
photographs of a distinctive lamp and clock that were sitting on a side table
in the Tenant’s bedroom and a similarly distinctive wall decoration that was
hanging above the sofa in the living room. In other words, ZP’s own web site
shows photographs that appear to have been taken of the rental unit. When this
was pointed out to her the Tenant’s Agent stated she had no idea why this was
the case, she has nothing to do with her employer’s web site, but she is aware
that it is currently being updated.
52. Given all of the above, I am satisfied that the
Tenant’s Agent is not a credible witness. Her testimony about the broken stove
top knobs is demonstrably untrue. The e-mail of November 7, 2017, the filing of
the Tenant’s application and the manner in which the filing fee was paid, the
behaviour of the Tenant’s Agent in attending at the unit for the Landlords’
inspection and for the move, and the photographs entered into evidence, all
support the conclusion that the Tenant’s Agent is not telling the truth when
she says she did all of it as a favour for the Tenant.
53. As a result, where the testimony of the Tenant’s
Agent with respect to the damage to the rental unit conflicts with the evidence
and testimony of the Landlord, I accept the Landlords’ evidence over that of
the Tenant. This means that I do not accept the testimony of the Tenant’s Agent
to the effect that some of the damage claimed by the Landlords did not exist at
the time the Tenant’s Agent returned the key to the concierge.
54. The specific items of damage the Landlords claim
in the application concern: the carpeting; the hardwood flooring; the window
blinds; the silicone in the bathroom shower enclosure; the shower door; the
condition of painted surfaces; the stove knobs; and the lock for the door of
the rental unit.
55. With respect to the carpeting, the evidence
establishes the carpet in the bedroom was left badly stained. When the Landlords
regained possession they could not afford to replace the carpets and needed to
mitigate their damages by re-renting the unit as quickly as they could. So they
had the carpets professionally cleaned but the cleaning did not remove the
stains.
56. In the main living area of the unit there is
engineered hardwood flooring. Photographs entered into evidence show marks and
damage consistent with heavy items being dragged. There is also an area that
has some sort of build-up that cannot be removed.
57. Vertical blinds hang in the windows throughout
the unit that were fixtures rented with the unit. A number of the slats were
torn or otherwise damaged so that they could not be re-hung.
58. The silicone sealant in the walk in shower was
so significantly stained with mildew or some other type of mould that it could
not be removed with regular cleaning. One of the reviews of the unit on the
airbnb website complains of the mould.
59. The shower door was off its hinges or otherwise
not working properly.
60. A number of the photographs entered into
evidence show that in various places throughout the unit the walls and other
painted surfaces were chipped, dented, or otherwise marked.
61. Two of the four knobs for the burners on the
stove top were broken.
62. The Landlords had the condominium corporation
change the lock to the rental unit out of concern that some of the airbnb
guests or other individuals might have kept keys.
Analysis
63. The Tenant argues that the damage the Landlords
complain of is in the nature of normal wear and tear and therefore is not
“undue”. It is his submission that over time and from normal non-negligent use,
painted finishes get dented and marked, floors get scuffed, carpets get worn
and things get spilled, the silicone in shower enclosures develops mildew,
doors come off hinges, and vertical blind slats fall out.
64. The Landlords argue that although some of the
damage is akin to normal wear and tear in kind, the degree or extent of the
damage is excessive and directly related to the negligent or wilful behaviour
of the Tenant in permitting the unit to be used as an airbnb home share without
the Landlords’ knowledge or consent.
65. The use of the phrase “undue damage” indicates
that some damage to a rental unit is expected with everyday use. I would agree
with the Tenant that normal wear and tear is not undue and the Tenant cannot be
held liable to the Landlord for it.
66. That being said, I agree with the Landlord that
much of what is claimed here cannot be said to be the result of normal,
everyday use. Further, some of the damage is clearly associated with careless
or negligent behaviour or wilfulness.
67. For example, the two broken knobs on the stove
top did not get broken on their own. The damage is consistent only with someone
deliberately applying inappropriate force or carelessly misapplying force
because he or she did not know how to turn the knobs on or off properly. Absent
evidence from the Tenant as to how the knobs were actually damaged, I am
satisfied that the only reasonable explanation of the cause of the damage is wilful
or negligent conduct by the Tenant, an occupant or a guest.
68. Although it is common for people to accidentally
spill things on a carpet, particularly in a dining room, it is still indicative
of carelessness. And when it does happen, the reasonably prudent tenant makes
efforts to immediately clean it up. That is what spot cleaning products are
for. But the typical user of an airbnb unit is not in the same position as the
reasonably prudent tenant. For an airbnb user, the unit is akin to a hotel
room. I would not expect the typical airbnb consumer to travel with cleaning
products and no evidence was led here that there were products in the unit available
for a traveller’s use.
69. The photographs of the bedroom carpet taken by
both parties show heavy staining that is consistent with multiple careless
spills of liquid that were not tended to or spot cleaned in a timely manner.
Although I do not have photographs of the carpet after it was cleaned I have no
reason to doubt the Landlord’s testimony that the carpets remain stained after
professional cleaning.
70. In other words, although it is normal for a
landlord to have to vacuum and clean carpets on turnover, it is not normal for
the carpets to be this badly stained after a tenancy of less than two years.
The damage to the carpets is excessive and therefore, I find it is undue. It is
also consistent with behaviour on the part of the Tenant’s guests that can only
be described as careless; there were repeated spills of liquids not properly attended
to or spot cleaned in a timely and reasonable manner.
71. The same analysis is equally applicable to the
wooden floors, the silicone in the shower enclosure, the vertical blinds, and
the painted surfaces.
72. The pictures of the wooden flooring are
consistent with heavy objects like suitcases being carelessly dragged across
them. Some sort of build-up is visible in pictures entered into evidence
consistent with someone spilling some sort of glue or plasticized product that
then set and hardened.
73. Mildew grows on silicone in showers but it takes
years to get to the state this shower was in unless it is not cleaned with
bleach based cleaners or there is a serious ventilation problem. No evidence
was led of a ventilation problem in this bathroom so I am satisfied that the
cleaning done during the tenancy was done in a negligent manner because proper
cleaning products were not used.
74. The pictures of the blinds show multiple
individual slats were damaged and could not be used. Most of the damage is to
the top of the slat where the piece connects with the frame but at least one is
split at the bottom. In the closed position, the blinds show clear gaps where
pieces are missing.
75. Again, with normal use, individual vertical
blind slats will get damaged from opening and closing. Again, the degree of the
damage will increase with the carelessness of the user. The number of broken
and damaged slats visible in the Landlords’ photographs is excessive given a
tenancy of less than two years and is more consistent with repeated instances
of careless and negligent use.
76. The photographs show chips in the painted
finishes, scuff marks, and stains. Some of that is normal and typical but the
degree and amount of those kinds of marks as shown in the photographs supports
the conclusion that the Tenant’s airbnb guests were repeatedly less than
careful about moving around the unit.
77. So with respect to the wooden floors, the
silicone in the shower enclosure, the blinds and the painted surfaces in the
unit, I am satisfied that some if not all of the damage is undue and caused in
part by carelessness or negligent use or neglect.
78. With respect to the shower door, no evidence was
led as to how the door came off its hinges and it was easily repaired. Given
the nature of how such doors work, and my experience of like similar cases
before the Board, this kind of problem is consistent with both normal use and
negligent use. As a result, absent additional evidence, I am not prepared to
make a finding that the damage was excessive or out of the ordinary or more
consistent with negligence then ordinary usage. So the claim with respect to
the shower door must be dismissed. The evidence is insufficient to establish
the damage is undue.
79. The real difficulty that arises here is with
respect to assessing the quantum the Landlords are entitled to for the
reasonable cost of repair or replacement where repair is not reasonable.
80. The task is easiest with respect to the knobs
for the stove and the carpet.
81. According to the invoices filed, the Landlords
were able to purchase replacement knobs on-line at $25.80 each plus shipping
and HST. For some unknown reason the invoice shows the Landlords purchased
three although the evidence indicates only two were broken. This price is
clearly a reasonable amount for replacement knobs so I am satisfied the
Landlords are entitled to an order for two-thirds of the invoice filed or
$74.83. The evidence is unclear what if any amount was incurred for labour
costs related to replacing the knobs so no amount shall be ordered for labour.
82. As stated above, I accept the Landlords’
evidence that the carpet cannot in fact be repaired as the stains cannot be
removed. As a result, the Landlords are entitled to the reasonable cost the
Landlords will incur for replacing the carpet. The fact the Landlords have not
yet replaced the carpet because they could not afford it but still managed to
re-rent the unit does not negate their entitlement to that amount.
83. I would observe at this point that the wording
of s. 89(1) indicates the Landlords are not entitled to both the reasonable
cost of repair and the reasonable cost of replacement. So the Landlords are not
entitled to an order for the cost of cleaning the carpet.
84. The Landlords provided a quote from their
contractor for future replacement of the carpet of $2,400.00 plus HST of 13%.
No evidence was led to suggest this is an unreasonable amount, and based on my
experience of like claims I am not prepared to say that it is so an order shall
issue requiring the Tenant to pay to the Landlord $2,431.20 for replacing the
carpet.
85. The Landlords paid $550.00 plus HST to remove
and replace the silicone in the shower enclosure.
86. As stated above, some staining of the silicone
would be expecting from normal prudent use and cleaning. In other words, some
of the damage is undue and some is not. As the Tenant can only be held
responsible for the part that is undue some apportionment of responsibility for
the cost of replacing the silicone is appropriate.
87. Given the photographs filed and my experience of
like similar cases before the Board I am of the view that about 80% of the
mildew damage caused is attributable to the Tenant’s behaviour in failing to
use appropriate cleaning products. As a result, the Tenant shall be ordered to
pay to the Landlords 80% of the cost of replacing the silicone or $445.72.
88. A similar apportionment exercise would be
appropriate with respect to the damage to the floors, the painted surfaces, and
the blinds.
89. I should observe at this point that the parties
provided me with dozens of photographs of the state of the unit at the end of
the tenancy. Without them it would have been impossible for the Board to assess
how much of the damage can be attributed to normal wear and tear and how much
is excessive or undue.
90. Having examined those pictures carefully, and
taking into account my experience of like similar cases, it seems to me that
80% of the damage to the flooring is undue, as is 40% of the damage to the
painted surfaces and 90% of the damage to the blinds.
91. The vertical blinds were repaired at a cost of
$450.00 plus HST and I am satisfied that is a reasonable amount. So an order
will issue requiring the Tenant to pay to the Landlord $364.68 for the undue
damage to the blinds.
92. With respect to the damage to the painted
surfaces, the Landlord paid $550.00 plus HST, but that amount included an
unknown amount for “adjust kitchen hardware etc” and no evidence was led as to
how much of the total was with respect to the painted surfaces and how much was
not. As a result, it is not possible to assess how much of that cost is attributable
to the undue damage caused by the negligent conduct of the Tenant, an occupant
or a guest.
93. That being said, I am satisfied some costs were
incurred by the Landlords as a result of undue damage to the painted surfaces,
so in the absence of sufficient evidence that would enable the Board to
quantify it, it would be appropriate to award a nominal amount which I fix at
$25.00.
94. With respect to the engineered wood flooring the
Landlords obtained a quote “to repair damaged hardwood floor in the living
room, or to replace if necessary” for $1,100.00 plus HST. Given my experience
of the cost to replace flooring of this kind this is a reasonable amount, so
the Tenant will be ordered to pay to the Landlords $891.44 which represents 80%
of the cost the Landlords will incur to repair the flooring.
95. That leaves the claim for compensation with
respect to the changing of the lock.
96. Although I can understand why the Landlords
changed the lock and can appreciate it was probably prudent to do so, there was
nothing wrong with the lock. It was not damaged or in a state of disrepair.
Subsection 89(1) only addresses actual damage to the rental unit or residential
complex. This amount is not recoverable under the Act.
Conclusion
97. Finally, the Landlords incurred costs of $175.00
for filing the application and are entitled to reimbursement of those costs.
98. This order contains all of the reasons for the
decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.
It is ordered
that:
1.
The Tenant’s application is
dismissed.
2.
The Landlords’ application
filed pursuant to s. 69 is dismissed without prejudice.
3.
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlords $4,232.87 for compensation for undue damage.
4.
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.
The total amount the Tenant
owes the Landlords under this order is $4,407.87.
6.
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlords the full amount owing on or before August 4, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
August 5, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.

(the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict S.B. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant; and because the Tenant or another occupant of the rental unit has committed an illegal act or has carried out, or permitted someone to carry out an illegal trade, business or occupation in the rental unit or the residential complex. The Landlord has also applied for an order for compensation for undue damage the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date. The Tenant then applied for an order determining that the Landlord or the Landlord's agent harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with the Tenant, entered the rental unit illegally, altered the locking system on a door giving entry to the rental unit or residential complex without giving the Tenant replacement keys and substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenant or by a member of the Tenant's household. These applications were heard together in Toronto on May 30, 2018. The first-named Landlord above (the ‘Landlord’) and the Tenant’s agent, M.M. (the ‘Tenant’s Agent’), attended the hearing. The Landlords were represented by A.V.. The Tenant was represented by M.P. Determinations: 1. This application involves a condominium apartment. The Landlords allege the Tenant never lived in the rental unit; rather, he turned it into an airbnb unit which was then rented out dozens if not hundreds of times to travellers as if it was a hotel room. It is the Landlords’ position that this activity caused excessive and undue damage to the rental unit which is recoverable under s. 89(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). 2. The Tenant argues that the Board lacks the jurisdiction to consider the Landlords’ claim because the application was amended to include it after the Tenant moved out. In the alternative, the Tenant argues the Landlords’ evidence is insufficient to establish that the alleged damage occurred prior to the Tenant returning vacant possession to the Landlords. In the further alternative, the Tenant argues the damage the Landlords claim is as a result of ordinary wear and tear and not undue. PRELIMINARY ISSUES 3. At the beginning of the hearing I raised a preliminary issue with respect to the Tenant’s application. It is electronically signed by the Tenant’s Agent and not by the Tenant. In response to my questions I learned the Tenant’s Agent is not a licensee under the Law Society Act nor does she hold a power of attorney for property for the Tenant. 4. The reason this is an issue is because s. 185 of the Act says: (1) An application shall be filed with the Board in the form approved by the Board, shall be accompanied by the prescribed information and shall be signed by the applicant. (2) An applicant may give written authorization to sign an application to a person representing the applicant under the authority of the Law Society Act and, if the applicant does so, the Board may require such representative to file a copy of the authorization. [Emphasis added.] 5. Pursuant to s. 59 of Ontario Regulation 516/06, an application that is electronic filed is signed by the applicant by typing his or her name in the space provided. 6. As can be seen from the wording of s. 185, an application must be signed by the applicant or by someone representing the applicant under the authority of the Law Society Act. As a valid power of attorney for property gives the attorney the legal authority to deal with the donor’s financial affairs, an attorney may also sign an application. Where an application is signed by a lawyer or paralegal the Board may require the representative to file with the Board written authorization signed by the applicant that permits the lawyer or paralegal to act. 7. The clear and obvious purpose of this provision is to ensure that the named applicant is truly the driving force behind the claim being asserted and the Board and the respondent can rest assured the applicant can rightly be held responsible for the conduct of the litigation. 8. This is of particular concern in a case like this where the applicant does not attend the hearing of the application. Where the applicant is present, the applicant can endorse the application on the record and the requirements of the Act and the purpose of the provision are met. Where the applicant is not present, the application can be adjourned so he or she can attend or file and serve an amended application. 9. After inviting submissions on the issue the Tenant’s representative did not seek to adjourn the application so it was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 10. The second preliminary issue that arose at the beginning of the hearing concerns the Landlords’ application brought pursuant to s. 69 of the Act. 11. After some discussion the Landlords sought the consent of the Board to withdraw their request for an order terminating the tenancy. I believe this request is motivated by a desire on the part of the Landlords to leave open the possibility of pursuing prospective rent in another forum. As this application is not an application for arrears of rent, I granted the Landlords’ request without prejudice pursuant to s. 200(4) of the Act. 12. The third preliminary issue that was argued before me was actually raised by the Tenant’s representative at the very end of the hearing. 13. The Tenant argues that the Board lacks jurisdiction to hear the Tenant’s claim made by way of s. 89(1) of the Act because the application was filed after the Tenant ceased to be in possession of the rental unit. This assertion on the part of the Tenant is actually not true but deserves some explanation. 14. Subsection 89(1) says: A landlord may apply to the Board for an order requiring a tenant to pay reasonable costs that the landlord has incurred or will incur for the repair of or, where repairing is not reasonable, the replacement of damaged property, if the tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person whom the tenant permits in the residential complex wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to the rental unit or the residential complex and the tenant is in possession of the rental unit. [Emphasis added.] 15. This limitation on a landlord’s ability to apply to the Board for a monetary remedy is echoed in sections 87 (for rent arrears) and section 90 (for payment of rent due as a result of a misrepresentation of income in a rent-geared-to-income situation). The Board’s jurisdiction over such claims is split with that of the regular court system. A landlord can apply to the Board for a monetary remedy while a tenant is still in possession but after the tenant moves out and returns vacant possession to the landlord the claim must be asserted elsewhere. 16. The difficulty with the Tenant’s argument is that the Landlords filed this application with the Board on December 4, 2017, well before the Landlords went back into possession at the end of February, 2018. The application filed on December 4, 2017 includes a claim made pursuant to s. 89(1). 17. I believe the reason this is even an issue is because on March 14, 2018, the Landlords filed a request to amend the application to increase the damage claim from $370.00 to $10,545.53. In other words, what the Tenant is really trying to argue is that the Board should not grant the Landlords’ request to amend the application because it was filed with the Board after the Tenant moved out. 18. There is nothing in the Act or the Board’s Rules of Practice to support this argument. 19. Pursuant to s. 200(1) an applicant may amend an application to the Board in accordance with the Rules. 20. Rule 16 is the applicable Rule. The relevant parts of Rule 16 read as follows: 16.1 An applicant who wishes to amend the application before the hearing shall: a.   file the written request for the amendment and an amended application; b.   give a copy of the documents to all other parties; c.   file a certificate of service for the request and the amended application. 16.2 When an applicant files a request to amend an application, LTB staff will process the amended application and, if necessary, issue a new Notice of Hearing. The decision about whether or not to grant the requested amendment will be made by an LTB Member. … 16.4 The LTB shall decide whether to permit an amendment taking into consideration the following factors: a.   whether the amendment was requested as soon as the need for it was known, if that was important in the circumstances; b.   any prejudice a party may experience as a result of the amendment; c.   whether the amendment is significant enough to warrant any delay that may be caused by the amendment; d.   whether the amendment is necessary and was requested in good faith; and e.   any other relevant factors. 21. There is no question here that the Landlords complied with Rule 16.1. 22. Rule 16.2 specifically requires that a Board Member consider and then grant or deny any requested amendments. In practice, where a requested amendment is necessary and relevant, and the respondent receives ample notice, the Board impliedly grants amendments at the beginning of a hearing without explicit comment or inviting further submissions. 23. In fact landlord’s applications for termination for arrears of rent are amended every day at the Board as a matter of course when a tenant has moved out after the application was filed. The application is converted from one governed by s. 74 to one filed under s. 87 even though an application cannot be filed under s. 87 once a tenant has gone out of possession. 24. So where a party wishes to challenge a request to amend it should be done at the very beginning of the hearing and not at the end after all of the evidence was heard as was the case here. 25. Nevertheless, even if the Tenant had objected to the amendment request at the start of the hearing, the Landlords’ request to amend would still have been granted. This is because the amendment is timely, necessary, and the Tenant has been given ample notice of the additional monetary claims being made. 26. It is necessary because the Landlords say they discovered additional damage after the Landlords went back into possession which was after the application was filed. It was filed and served less than three weeks after the Landlords went back into possession so it was timely. Finally, the request to amend was filed and served on the Tenant two and a half months prior to the hearing before me so it cannot be said the Tenant was unfairly prejudiced as a result of the amendment. 27. I would also observe that if the Board did not grant the amendment requested then because of the common law doctrine of issue estoppel the Landlords almost certainly would have had to withdraw the application before the Board and assert the claim anew in Small Claims Court. That would result in additional costs for both parties and be wasteful of adjudicative and staff resources due to unnecessary duplication. 28. Given all of the above, I am satisfied the Board has the jurisdiction to grant the request to amend and the request is granted. The Board has the jurisdiction to consider the claims asserted. THE LANDLORDS’ CLAIM UNDER S. 89(1) 29. As a result of all of the above, the only real issues before the Board are with respect to the Landlords’ damage claim under s. 89(1) of the Act. 30. As can be seen from the wording of the provision, s. 89(1) claims require the Board to explore: • The nature of the damage (is it undue or normal wear and tear); • How the damage occurred (was it a result of negligence or wilful conduct); • Whether or not the damaged property can reasonably be repaired; and • The reasonable cost of repair, or replacement where repair is not a reasonable option. 31. Despite this relatively narrow focus for the inquiry on this application, the Landlords were permitted on cross-examination of the Tenant’s Agent to ask questions about the tenancy itself in order in part to explore the cause of the alleged damage but also because they take the position the Tenant’s Agent is not a credible witness. Findings of Fact 32. The Landlords bought this condominium unit in 2016. The Landlord says at the time they purchased it the unit was spotless. It had been rented out for the three years prior to their purchase. 33. Immediately after buying the unit the Landlords’ real estate agent negotiated the tenancy agreement with the Tenant’s real estate agent. The Landlords were not personally involved and did not meet the Tenant. As far as they were aware, the Tenant is an accountant who works for a property management company that shall be referred to here as ZP. The tenancy commenced May 1, 2016. 34. In 2017 the Landlords discovered the rental unit was listed on the airbnb website as a home share available for short term rentals without their knowledge or consent. 35. Airbnb records indicate it was only one of multiple units being offered by a host named “Sofia”. The Landlords do not know “Sofia”. In an investigative article done by CBC News, “Sofia” is quoted as saying she works for ZP. 36. The Tenant’s Agent says she is a property manager who works for ZP. She says she knows “Sofia” but she is not an employee of ZP. Rather, “Sofia” is a contractor who does some work with ZP. After the CBC News article appeared, the Tenant’s Agent says “Sofia” was spoken to about her misrepresentation. 37. The Tenant’s Agent also says the Tenant does not work for ZP. Rather he is employed by a gas station that is owned by AN who is the owner of ZP. 38. She says that she started working for ZP in September of 2017 and she never met or spoke with the Tenant until November of 2017. She says she overheard people in her office discussing the Landlords’ behaviour towards the Tenant when they discovered the unit was being rented out through airbnb as a home share. She says that at the time the Tenant was in India so she decided to help him out. 39. When the Landlords found out something was going on with the unit they attempted to contact the Tenant and served notice of entry. 40. On November 7, 2017, the Tenant’s Agent sent an e-mail to the Landlords describing herself as a property manager with ZP. In the e-mail she states the Tenant is her “client”. 41. The Tenant’s Agent says that was a mistake. The Tenant was never a client of ZP. She was just helping him out on her own time. 42. The e-mail the Tenant’s Agent sent on November 7, 2017 concerns the Landlords’ obligation to provide proper notice of termination if they wish to end the tenancy, and then states: A representative of [ZP] will be at the above location today, November 7, 2017, between the hours of 7:00pm-8:00pm, for the purpose of inspection of the unit. 43. After that the unit was inspected, the Landlords met the Tenant’s Agent, and notices of termination were served on the Tenant. 44. During one of the inspections the Landlords discovered cleaning records. They are the type of dated and signed charts that can often be seen in public washrooms. The charts have a list of cleaning chores on one side, dates at the top of columns that are to be initialed by a cleaner, and checkmarks to indicate the tasks have been performed. The Landlords took photographs of these records that are entered into evidence. The cleaners appear to have been there frequently. At some times it was every couple of days. 45. On December 4, 2017, the Tenant’s application was filed by the Board. As stated above, it was not filed by the Tenant, but by the Tenant’s Agent. The filing fee was charged to a credit card belonging to AN, the owner of ZP. 46. The Tenant’s Agent says this was also a mistake. She is used to filing applications with the Board and charging the filing fee to her employer in the course of her work so she just did what she normally does. But ZP has nothing to do with the tenancy or the Tenant’s application. She was just helping the Tenant out as a favour. 47. On the evening of February 26, 2018, the unit was emptied by movers. The Tenant’s Agent was present and took photographs which were entered into evidence. She says it is her practice in her job to take photographs after a tenant moves out so she did it this time too, even though she was merely helping the Tenant out on her own time. 48. During the course of the testimony in chief of the Tenant’s Agent, the Tenant’s representative showed her a set of photographs. She initially stated those photographs were taken by her. She then corrected herself and said the photographs were given to her by the Tenant. The photographs in question include the ones that appear on the airbnb website to advertise the unit. 49. One of the items of damage the Landlords are claiming is with respect to two knobs on the stove top that were broken off. 50. The Tenant’s Agent says that when the movers were finished moving out items from the unit and the keys returned to the concierge, the stove knobs were in perfect working order. They were not broken. She says her photographs of the stove show that. That is not true. In her photographs of the stove top, it is possible to see that the top two knobs on the stove top are broken. They were put back in place before the photographs were taken, but the cracks in them where they are broken can still be seen. When this was pointed out to the Tenant’s Agent on cross-examination, she persisted in stating the knobs were not broken when vacant possession was returned to the Landlords. 51. Finally, the Landlords filed into evidence photographs downloaded from the web site belonging to ZP. They include photographs of a distinctive lamp and clock that were sitting on a side table in the Tenant’s bedroom and a similarly distinctive wall decoration that was hanging above the sofa in the living room. In other words, ZP’s own web site shows photographs that appear to have been taken of the rental unit. When this was pointed out to her the Tenant’s Agent stated she had no idea why this was the case, she has nothing to do with her employer’s web site, but she is aware that it is currently being updated. 52. Given all of the above, I am satisfied that the Tenant’s Agent is not a credible witness. Her testimony about the broken stove top knobs is demonstrably untrue. The e-mail of November 7, 2017, the filing of the Tenant’s application and the manner in which the filing fee was paid, the behaviour of the Tenant’s Agent in attending at the unit for the Landlords’ inspection and for the move, and the photographs entered into evidence, all support the conclusion that the Tenant’s Agent is not telling the truth when she says she did all of it as a favour for the Tenant. 53. As a result, where the testimony of the Tenant’s Agent with respect to the damage to the rental unit conflicts with the evidence and testimony of the Landlord, I accept the Landlords’ evidence over that of the Tenant. This means that I do not accept the testimony of the Tenant’s Agent to the effect that some of the damage claimed by the Landlords did not exist at the time the Tenant’s Agent returned the key to the concierge. 54. The specific items of damage the Landlords claim in the application concern: the carpeting; the hardwood flooring; the window blinds; the silicone in the bathroom shower enclosure; the shower door; the condition of painted surfaces; the stove knobs; and the lock for the door of the rental unit. 55. With respect to the carpeting, the evidence establishes the carpet in the bedroom was left badly stained. When the Landlords regained possession they could not afford to replace the carpets and needed to mitigate their damages by re-renting the unit as quickly as they could. So they had the carpets professionally cleaned but the cleaning did not remove the stains. 56. In the main living area of the unit there is engineered hardwood flooring. Photographs entered into evidence show marks and damage consistent with heavy items being dragged. There is also an area that has some sort of build-up that cannot be removed. 57. Vertical blinds hang in the windows throughout the unit that were fixtures rented with the unit. A number of the slats were torn or otherwise damaged so that they could not be re-hung. 58. The silicone sealant in the walk in shower was so significantly stained with mildew or some other type of mould that it could not be removed with regular cleaning. One of the reviews of the unit on the airbnb website complains of the mould. 59. The shower door was off its hinges or otherwise not working properly. 60. A number of the photographs entered into evidence show that in various places throughout the unit the walls and other painted surfaces were chipped, dented, or otherwise marked. 61. Two of the four knobs for the burners on the stove top were broken. 62. The Landlords had the condominium corporation change the lock to the rental unit out of concern that some of the airbnb guests or other individuals might have kept keys. Analysis 63. The Tenant argues that the damage the Landlords complain of is in the nature of normal wear and tear and therefore is not “undue”. It is his submission that over time and from normal non-negligent use, painted finishes get dented and marked, floors get scuffed, carpets get worn and things get spilled, the silicone in shower enclosures develops mildew, doors come off hinges, and vertical blind slats fall out. 64. The Landlords argue that although some of the damage is akin to normal wear and tear in kind, the degree or extent of the damage is excessive and directly related to the negligent or wilful behaviour of the Tenant in permitting the unit to be used as an airbnb home share without the Landlords’ knowledge or consent. 65. The use of the phrase “undue damage” indicates that some damage to a rental unit is expected with everyday use. I would agree with the Tenant that normal wear and tear is not undue and the Tenant cannot be held liable to the Landlord for it. 66. That being said, I agree with the Landlord that much of what is claimed here cannot be said to be the result of normal, everyday use. Further, some of the damage is clearly associated with careless or negligent behaviour or wilfulness. 67. For example, the two broken knobs on the stove top did not get broken on their own. The damage is consistent only with someone deliberately applying inappropriate force or carelessly misapplying force because he or she did not know how to turn the knobs on or off properly. Absent evidence from the Tenant as to how the knobs were actually damaged, I am satisfied that the only reasonable explanation of the cause of the damage is wilful or negligent conduct by the Tenant, an occupant or a guest. 68. Although it is common for people to accidentally spill things on a carpet, particularly in a dining room, it is still indicative of carelessness. And when it does happen, the reasonably prudent tenant makes efforts to immediately clean it up. That is what spot cleaning products are for. But the typical user of an airbnb unit is not in the same position as the reasonably prudent tenant. For an airbnb user, the unit is akin to a hotel room. I would not expect the typical airbnb consumer to travel with cleaning products and no evidence was led here that there were products in the unit available for a traveller’s use. 69. The photographs of the bedroom carpet taken by both parties show heavy staining that is consistent with multiple careless spills of liquid that were not tended to or spot cleaned in a timely manner. Although I do not have photographs of the carpet after it was cleaned I have no reason to doubt the Landlord’s testimony that the carpets remain stained after professional cleaning. 70. In other words, although it is normal for a landlord to have to vacuum and clean carpets on turnover, it is not normal for the carpets to be this badly stained after a tenancy of less than two years. The damage to the carpets is excessive and therefore, I find it is undue. It is also consistent with behaviour on the part of the Tenant’s guests that can only be described as careless; there were repeated spills of liquids not properly attended to or spot cleaned in a timely and reasonable manner. 71. The same analysis is equally applicable to the wooden floors, the silicone in the shower enclosure, the vertical blinds, and the painted surfaces. 72. The pictures of the wooden flooring are consistent with heavy objects like suitcases being carelessly dragged across them. Some sort of build-up is visible in pictures entered into evidence consistent with someone spilling some sort of glue or plasticized product that then set and hardened. 73. Mildew grows on silicone in showers but it takes years to get to the state this shower was in unless it is not cleaned with bleach based cleaners or there is a serious ventilation problem. No evidence was led of a ventilation problem in this bathroom so I am satisfied that the cleaning done during the tenancy was done in a negligent manner because proper cleaning products were not used. 74. The pictures of the blinds show multiple individual slats were damaged and could not be used. Most of the damage is to the top of the slat where the piece connects with the frame but at least one is split at the bottom. In the closed position, the blinds show clear gaps where pieces are missing. 75. Again, with normal use, individual vertical blind slats will get damaged from opening and closing. Again, the degree of the damage will increase with the carelessness of the user. The number of broken and damaged slats visible in the Landlords’ photographs is excessive given a tenancy of less than two years and is more consistent with repeated instances of careless and negligent use. 76. The photographs show chips in the painted finishes, scuff marks, and stains. Some of that is normal and typical but the degree and amount of those kinds of marks as shown in the photographs supports the conclusion that the Tenant’s airbnb guests were repeatedly less than careful about moving around the unit. 77. So with respect to the wooden floors, the silicone in the shower enclosure, the blinds and the painted surfaces in the unit, I am satisfied that some if not all of the damage is undue and caused in part by carelessness or negligent use or neglect. 78. With respect to the shower door, no evidence was led as to how the door came off its hinges and it was easily repaired. Given the nature of how such doors work, and my experience of like similar cases before the Board, this kind of problem is consistent with both normal use and negligent use. As a result, absent additional evidence, I am not prepared to make a finding that the damage was excessive or out of the ordinary or more consistent with negligence then ordinary usage. So the claim with respect to the shower door must be dismissed. The evidence is insufficient to establish the damage is undue. 79. The real difficulty that arises here is with respect to assessing the quantum the Landlords are entitled to for the reasonable cost of repair or replacement where repair is not reasonable. 80. The task is easiest with respect to the knobs for the stove and the carpet. 81. According to the invoices filed, the Landlords were able to purchase replacement knobs on-line at $25.80 each plus shipping and HST. For some unknown reason the invoice shows the Landlords purchased three although the evidence indicates only two were broken. This price is clearly a reasonable amount for replacement knobs so I am satisfied the Landlords are entitled to an order for two-thirds of the invoice filed or $74.83. The evidence is unclear what if any amount was incurred for labour costs related to replacing the knobs so no amount shall be ordered for labour. 82. As stated above, I accept the Landlords’ evidence that the carpet cannot in fact be repaired as the stains cannot be removed. As a result, the Landlords are entitled to the reasonable cost the Landlords will incur for replacing the carpet. The fact the Landlords have not yet replaced the carpet because they could not afford it but still managed to re-rent the unit does not negate their entitlement to that amount. 83. I would observe at this point that the wording of s. 89(1) indicates the Landlords are not entitled to both the reasonable cost of repair and the reasonable cost of replacement. So the Landlords are not entitled to an order for the cost of cleaning the carpet. 84. The Landlords provided a quote from their contractor for future replacement of the carpet of $2,400.00 plus HST of 13%. No evidence was led to suggest this is an unreasonable amount, and based on my experience of like claims I am not prepared to say that it is so an order shall issue requiring the Tenant to pay to the Landlord $2,431.20 for replacing the carpet. 85. The Landlords paid $550.00 plus HST to remove and replace the silicone in the shower enclosure. 86. As stated above, some staining of the silicone would be expecting from normal prudent use and cleaning. In other words, some of the damage is undue and some is not. As the Tenant can only be held responsible for the part that is undue some apportionment of responsibility for the cost of replacing the silicone is appropriate. 87. Given the photographs filed and my experience of like similar cases before the Board I am of the view that about 80% of the mildew damage caused is attributable to the Tenant’s behaviour in failing to use appropriate cleaning products. As a result, the Tenant shall be ordered to pay to the Landlords 80% of the cost of replacing the silicone or $445.72. 88. A similar apportionment exercise would be appropriate with respect to the damage to the floors, the painted surfaces, and the blinds. 89. I should observe at this point that the parties provided me with dozens of photographs of the state of the unit at the end of the tenancy. Without them it would have been impossible for the Board to assess how much of the damage can be attributed to normal wear and tear and how much is excessive or undue. 90. Having examined those pictures carefully, and taking into account my experience of like similar cases, it seems to me that 80% of the damage to the flooring is undue, as is 40% of the damage to the painted surfaces and 90% of the damage to the blinds. 91. The vertical blinds were repaired at a cost of $450.00 plus HST and I am satisfied that is a reasonable amount. So an order will issue requiring the Tenant to pay to the Landlord $364.68 for the undue damage to the blinds. 92. With respect to the damage to the painted surfaces, the Landlord paid $550.00 plus HST, but that amount included an unknown amount for “adjust kitchen hardware etc” and no evidence was led as to how much of the total was with respect to the painted surfaces and how much was not. As a result, it is not possible to assess how much of that cost is attributable to the undue damage caused by the negligent conduct of the Tenant, an occupant or a guest. 93. That being said, I am satisfied some costs were incurred by the Landlords as a result of undue damage to the painted surfaces, so in the absence of sufficient evidence that would enable the Board to quantify it, it would be appropriate to award a nominal amount which I fix at $25.00. 94. With respect to the engineered wood flooring the Landlords obtained a quote “to repair damaged hardwood floor in the living room, or to replace if necessary” for $1,100.00 plus HST. Given my experience of the cost to replace flooring of this kind this is a reasonable amount, so the Tenant will be ordered to pay to the Landlords $891.44 which represents 80% of the cost the Landlords will incur to repair the flooring. 95. That leaves the claim for compensation with respect to the changing of the lock. 96. Although I can understand why the Landlords changed the lock and can appreciate it was probably prudent to do so, there was nothing wrong with the lock. It was not damaged or in a state of disrepair. Subsection 89(1) only addresses actual damage to the rental unit or residential complex. This amount is not recoverable under the Act. Conclusion 97. Finally, the Landlords incurred costs of $175.00 for filing the application and are entitled to reimbursement of those costs. 98. This order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued. It is ordered that: 1. The Tenant’s application is dismissed. 2. The Landlords’ application filed pursuant to s. 69 is dismissed without prejudice. 3. The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $4,232.87 for compensation for undue damage. 4. The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $175.00 for the cost of filing the application. 5. The total amount the Tenant owes the Landlords under this order is $4,407.87. 6. If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount owing on or before August 4, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from August 5, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.

(the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict S.B. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant; and because the Tenant or another occupant of the rental unit has committed an illegal act or has carried out, or permitted someone to carry out an illegal trade, business or occupation in the rental unit or the residential complex. The Landlord has also applied for an order for compensation for undue damage the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.  The Tenant then applied for an order determining that the Landlord or the Landlord's agent harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with the Tenant, entered the rental unit illegally, altered the locking system on a door giving entry to the rental unit or residential complex without giving the Tenant replacement keys and substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenant or by a member of the Tenant's household.  These applications were heard together in Toronto on May 30, 2018.  The first-named Landlord above (the ‘Landlord’) and the Tenant’s agent, M.M. (the ‘Tenant’s Agent’), attended the hearing. The Landlords were represented by A.V.. The Tenant was represented by M.P.  Determinations:  1. This application involves a condominium apartment. The Landlords allege the Tenant never lived in the rental unit; rather, he turned it into an airbnb unit which was then rented out dozens if not hundreds of times to travellers as if it was a hotel room. It is the Landlords’ position that this activity caused excessive and undue damage to the rental unit which is recoverable under s. 89(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). 2. The Tenant argues that the Board lacks the jurisdiction to consider the Landlords’ claim because the application was amended to include it after the Tenant moved out. In the alternative, the Tenant argues the Landlords’ evidence is insufficient to establish that the alleged damage occurred prior to the Tenant returning vacant possession to the Landlords. In the further alternative, the Tenant argues the damage the Landlords claim is as a result of ordinary wear and tear and not undue. PRELIMINARY ISSUES 3. At the beginning of the hearing I raised a preliminary issue with respect to the Tenant’s application. It is electronically signed by the Tenant’s Agent and not by the Tenant. In response to my questions I learned the Tenant’s Agent is not a licensee under the Law Society Act nor does she hold a power of attorney for property for the Tenant. 4. The reason this is an issue is because s. 185 of the Act says: (1) An application shall be filed with the Board in the form approved by the Board, shall be accompanied by the prescribed information and shall be signed by the applicant. (2) An applicant may give written authorization to sign an application to a person representing the applicant under the authority of the Law Society Act and, if the applicant does so, the Board may require such representative to file a copy of the authorization. [Emphasis added.] 5. Pursuant to s. 59 of Ontario Regulation 516/06, an application that is electronic filed is signed by the applicant by typing his or her name in the space provided. 6. As can be seen from the wording of s. 185, an application must be signed by the applicant or by someone representing the applicant under the authority of the Law Society Act. As a valid power of attorney for property gives the attorney the legal authority to deal with the donor’s financial affairs, an attorney may also sign an application. Where an application is signed by a lawyer or paralegal the Board may require the representative to file with the Board written authorization signed by the applicant that permits the lawyer or paralegal to act. 7. The clear and obvious purpose of this provision is to ensure that the named applicant is truly the driving force behind the claim being asserted and the Board and the respondent can rest assured the applicant can rightly be held responsible for the conduct of the litigation. 8. This is of particular concern in a case like this where the applicant does not attend the hearing of the application. Where the applicant is present, the applicant can endorse the application on the record and the requirements of the Act and the purpose of the provision are met. Where the applicant is not present, the application can be adjourned so he or she can attend or file and serve an amended application. 9. After inviting submissions on the issue the Tenant’s representative did not seek to adjourn the application so it was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 10. The second preliminary issue that arose at the beginning of the hearing concerns the Landlords’ application brought pursuant to s. 69 of the Act. 11. After some discussion the Landlords sought the consent of the Board to withdraw their request for an order terminating the tenancy. I believe this request is motivated by a desire on the part of the Landlords to leave open the possibility of pursuing prospective rent in another forum. As this application is not an application for arrears of rent, I granted the Landlords’ request without prejudice pursuant to s. 200(4) of the Act. 12. The third preliminary issue that was argued before me was actually raised by the Tenant’s representative at the very end of the hearing. 13. The Tenant argues that the Board lacks jurisdiction to hear the Tenant’s claim made by way of s. 89(1) of the Act because the application was filed after the Tenant ceased to be in possession of the rental unit. This assertion on the part of the Tenant is actually not true but deserves some explanation. 14. Subsection 89(1) says: A landlord may apply to the Board for an order requiring a tenant to pay reasonable costs that the landlord has incurred or will incur for the repair of or, where repairing is not reasonable, the replacement of damaged property, if the tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person whom the tenant permits in the residential complex wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to the rental unit or the residential complex and the tenant is in possession of the rental unit. [Emphasis added.] 15. This limitation on a landlord’s ability to apply to the Board for a monetary remedy is echoed in sections 87 (for rent arrears) and section 90 (for payment of rent due as a result of a misrepresentation of income in a rent-geared-to-income situation). The Board’s jurisdiction over such claims is split with that of the regular court system. A landlord can apply to the Board for a monetary remedy while a tenant is still in possession but after the tenant moves out and returns vacant possession to the landlord the claim must be asserted elsewhere. 16. The difficulty with the Tenant’s argument is that the Landlords filed this application with the Board on December 4, 2017, well before the Landlords went back into possession at the end of February, 2018. The application filed on December 4, 2017 includes a claim made pursuant to s. 89(1). 17. I believe the reason this is even an issue is because on March 14, 2018, the Landlords filed a request to amend the application to increase the damage claim from $370.00 to $10,545.53. In other words, what the Tenant is really trying to argue is that the Board should not grant the Landlords’ request to amend the application because it was filed with the Board after the Tenant moved out. 18. There is nothing in the Act or the Board’s Rules of Practice to support this argument. 19. Pursuant to s. 200(1) an applicant may amend an application to the Board in accordance with the Rules. 20. Rule 16 is the applicable Rule. The relevant parts of Rule 16 read as follows: 16.1 An applicant who wishes to amend the application before the hearing shall: a. file the written request for the amendment and an amended application; b. give a copy of the documents to all other parties; c. file a certificate of service for the request and the amended application. 16.2 When an applicant files a request to amend an application, LTB staff will process the amended application and, if necessary, issue a new Notice of Hearing. The decision about whether or not to grant the requested amendment will be made by an LTB Member. … 16.4 The LTB shall decide whether to permit an amendment taking into consideration the following factors: a. whether the amendment was requested as soon as the need for it was known, if that was important in the circumstances; b. any prejudice a party may experience as a result of the amendment; c. whether the amendment is significant enough to warrant any delay that may be caused by the amendment; d. whether the amendment is necessary and was requested in good faith; and e. any other relevant factors. 21. There is no question here that the Landlords complied with Rule 16.1. 22. Rule 16.2 specifically requires that a Board Member consider and then grant or deny any requested amendments. In practice, where a requested amendment is necessary and relevant, and the respondent receives ample notice, the Board impliedly grants amendments at the beginning of a hearing without explicit comment or inviting further submissions. 23. In fact landlord’s applications for termination for arrears of rent are amended every day at the Board as a matter of course when a tenant has moved out after the application was filed. The application is converted from one governed by s. 74 to one filed under s. 87 even though an application cannot be filed under s. 87 once a tenant has gone out of possession. 24. So where a party wishes to challenge a request to amend it should be done at the very beginning of the hearing and not at the end after all of the evidence was heard as was the case here. 25. Nevertheless, even if the Tenant had objected to the amendment request at the start of the hearing, the Landlords’ request to amend would still have been granted. This is because the amendment is timely, necessary, and the Tenant has been given ample notice of the additional monetary claims being made. 26. It is necessary because the Landlords say they discovered additional damage after the Landlords went back into possession which was after the application was filed. It was filed and served less than three weeks after the Landlords went back into possession so it was timely. Finally, the request to amend was filed and served on the Tenant two and a half months prior to the hearing before me so it cannot be said the Tenant was unfairly prejudiced as a result of the amendment. 27. I would also observe that if the Board did not grant the amendment requested then because of the common law doctrine of issue estoppel the Landlords almost certainly would have had to withdraw the application before the Board and assert the claim anew in Small Claims Court. That would result in additional costs for both parties and be wasteful of adjudicative and staff resources due to unnecessary duplication. 28. Given all of the above, I am satisfied the Board has the jurisdiction to grant the request to amend and the request is granted. The Board has the jurisdiction to consider the claims asserted. THE LANDLORDS’ CLAIM UNDER S. 89(1) 29. As a result of all of the above, the only real issues before the Board are with respect to the Landlords’ damage claim under s. 89(1) of the Act. 30. As can be seen from the wording of the provision, s. 89(1) claims require the Board to explore: • The nature of the damage (is it undue or normal wear and tear); • How the damage occurred (was it a result of negligence or wilful conduct); • Whether or not the damaged property can reasonably be repaired; and • The reasonable cost of repair, or replacement where repair is not a reasonable option. 31. Despite this relatively narrow focus for the inquiry on this application, the Landlords were permitted on cross-examination of the Tenant’s Agent to ask questions about the tenancy itself in order in part to explore the cause of the alleged damage but also because they take the position the Tenant’s Agent is not a credible witness. Findings of Fact 32. The Landlords bought this condominium unit in 2016. The Landlord says at the time they purchased it the unit was spotless. It had been rented out for the three years prior to their purchase. 33. Immediately after buying the unit the Landlords’ real estate agent negotiated the tenancy agreement with the Tenant’s real estate agent. The Landlords were not personally involved and did not meet the Tenant. As far as they were aware, the Tenant is an accountant who works for a property management company that shall be referred to here as ZP. The tenancy commenced May 1, 2016. 34. In 2017 the Landlords discovered the rental unit was listed on the airbnb website as a home share available for short term rentals without their knowledge or consent. 35. Airbnb records indicate it was only one of multiple units being offered by a host named “Sofia”. The Landlords do not know “Sofia”. In an investigative article done by CBC News, “Sofia” is quoted as saying she works for ZP. 36. The Tenant’s Agent says she is a property manager who works for ZP. She says she knows “Sofia” but she is not an employee of ZP. Rather, “Sofia” is a contractor who does some work with ZP. After the CBC News article appeared, the Tenant’s Agent says “Sofia” was spoken to about her misrepresentation. 37. The Tenant’s Agent also says the Tenant does not work for ZP. Rather he is employed by a gas station that is owned by AN who is the owner of ZP. 38. She says that she started working for ZP in September of 2017 and she never met or spoke with the Tenant until November of 2017. She says she overheard people in her office discussing the Landlords’ behaviour towards the Tenant when they discovered the unit was being rented out through airbnb as a home share. She says that at the time the Tenant was in India so she decided to help him out. 39. When the Landlords found out something was going on with the unit they attempted to contact the Tenant and served notice of entry. 40. On November 7, 2017, the Tenant’s Agent sent an e-mail to the Landlords describing herself as a property manager with ZP. In the e-mail she states the Tenant is her “client”. 41. The Tenant’s Agent says that was a mistake. The Tenant was never a client of ZP. She was just helping him out on her own time. 42. The e-mail the Tenant’s Agent sent on November 7, 2017 concerns the Landlords’ obligation to provide proper notice of termination if they wish to end the tenancy, and then states: A representative of [ZP] will be at the above location today, November 7, 2017, between the hours of 7:00pm-8:00pm, for the purpose of inspection of the unit. 43. After that the unit was inspected, the Landlords met the Tenant’s Agent, and notices of termination were served on the Tenant. 44. During one of the inspections the Landlords discovered cleaning records. They are the type of dated and signed charts that can often be seen in public washrooms. The charts have a list of cleaning chores on one side, dates at the top of columns that are to be initialed by a cleaner, and checkmarks to indicate the tasks have been performed. The Landlords took photographs of these records that are entered into evidence. The cleaners appear to have been there frequently. At some times it was every couple of days. 45. On December 4, 2017, the Tenant’s application was filed by the Board. As stated above, it was not filed by the Tenant, but by the Tenant’s Agent. The filing fee was charged to a credit card belonging to AN, the owner of ZP. 46. The Tenant’s Agent says this was also a mistake. She is used to filing applications with the Board and charging the filing fee to her employer in the course of her work so she just did what she normally does. But ZP has nothing to do with the tenancy or the Tenant’s application. She was just helping the Tenant out as a favour. 47. On the evening of February 26, 2018, the unit was emptied by movers. The Tenant’s Agent was present and took photographs which were entered into evidence. She says it is her practice in her job to take photographs after a tenant moves out so she did it this time too, even though she was merely helping the Tenant out on her own time. 48. During the course of the testimony in chief of the Tenant’s Agent, the Tenant’s representative showed her a set of photographs. She initially stated those photographs were taken by her. She then corrected herself and said the photographs were given to her by the Tenant. The photographs in question include the ones that appear on the airbnb website to advertise the unit. 49. One of the items of damage the Landlords are claiming is with respect to two knobs on the stove top that were broken off. 50. The Tenant’s Agent says that when the movers were finished moving out items from the unit and the keys returned to the concierge, the stove knobs were in perfect working order. They were not broken. She says her photographs of the stove show that. That is not true. In her photographs of the stove top, it is possible to see that the top two knobs on the stove top are broken. They were put back in place before the photographs were taken, but the cracks in them where they are broken can still be seen. When this was pointed out to the Tenant’s Agent on cross-examination, she persisted in stating the knobs were not broken when vacant possession was returned to the Landlords. 51. Finally, the Landlords filed into evidence photographs downloaded from the web site belonging to ZP. They include photographs of a distinctive lamp and clock that were sitting on a side table in the Tenant’s bedroom and a similarly distinctive wall decoration that was hanging above the sofa in the living room. In other words, ZP’s own web site shows photographs that appear to have been taken of the rental unit. When this was pointed out to her the Tenant’s Agent stated she had no idea why this was the case, she has nothing to do with her employer’s web site, but she is aware that it is currently being updated. 52. Given all of the above, I am satisfied that the Tenant’s Agent is not a credible witness. Her testimony about the broken stove top knobs is demonstrably untrue. The e-mail of November 7, 2017, the filing of the Tenant’s application and the manner in which the filing fee was paid, the behaviour of the Tenant’s Agent in attending at the unit for the Landlords’ inspection and for the move, and the photographs entered into evidence, all support the conclusion that the Tenant’s Agent is not telling the truth when she says she did all of it as a favour for the Tenant. 53. As a result, where the testimony of the Tenant’s Agent with respect to the damage to the rental unit conflicts with the evidence and testimony of the Landlord, I accept the Landlords’ evidence over that of the Tenant. This means that I do not accept the testimony of the Tenant’s Agent to the effect that some of the damage claimed by the Landlords did not exist at the time the Tenant’s Agent returned the key to the concierge. 54. The specific items of damage the Landlords claim in the application concern: the carpeting; the hardwood flooring; the window blinds; the silicone in the bathroom shower enclosure; the shower door; the condition of painted surfaces; the stove knobs; and the lock for the door of the rental unit. 55. With respect to the carpeting, the evidence establishes the carpet in the bedroom was left badly stained. When the Landlords regained possession they could not afford to replace the carpets and needed to mitigate their damages by re-renting the unit as quickly as they could. So they had the carpets professionally cleaned but the cleaning did not remove the stains. 56. In the main living area of the unit there is engineered hardwood flooring. Photographs entered into evidence show marks and damage consistent with heavy items being dragged. There is also an area that has some sort of build-up that cannot be removed. 57. Vertical blinds hang in the windows throughout the unit that were fixtures rented with the unit. A number of the slats were torn or otherwise damaged so that they could not be re-hung. 58. The silicone sealant in the walk in shower was so significantly stained with mildew or some other type of mould that it could not be removed with regular cleaning. One of the reviews of the unit on the airbnb website complains of the mould. 59. The shower door was off its hinges or otherwise not working properly. 60. A number of the photographs entered into evidence show that in various places throughout the unit the walls and other painted surfaces were chipped, dented, or otherwise marked. 61. Two of the four knobs for the burners on the stove top were broken. 62. The Landlords had the condominium corporation change the lock to the rental unit out of concern that some of the airbnb guests or other individuals might have kept keys. Analysis 63. The Tenant argues that the damage the Landlords complain of is in the nature of normal wear and tear and therefore is not “undue”. It is his submission that over time and from normal non-negligent use, painted finishes get dented and marked, floors get scuffed, carpets get worn and things get spilled, the silicone in shower enclosures develops mildew, doors come off hinges, and vertical blind slats fall out. 64. The Landlords argue that although some of the damage is akin to normal wear and tear in kind, the degree or extent of the damage is excessive and directly related to the negligent or wilful behaviour of the Tenant in permitting the unit to be used as an airbnb home share without the Landlords’ knowledge or consent. 65. The use of the phrase “undue damage” indicates that some damage to a rental unit is expected with everyday use. I would agree with the Tenant that normal wear and tear is not undue and the Tenant cannot be held liable to the Landlord for it. 66. That being said, I agree with the Landlord that much of what is claimed here cannot be said to be the result of normal, everyday use. Further, some of the damage is clearly associated with careless or negligent behaviour or wilfulness. 67. For example, the two broken knobs on the stove top did not get broken on their own. The damage is consistent only with someone deliberately applying inappropriate force or carelessly misapplying force because he or she did not know how to turn the knobs on or off properly. Absent evidence from the Tenant as to how the knobs were actually damaged, I am satisfied that the only reasonable explanation of the cause of the damage is wilful or negligent conduct by the Tenant, an occupant or a guest. 68. Although it is common for people to accidentally spill things on a carpet, particularly in a dining room, it is still indicative of carelessness. And when it does happen, the reasonably prudent tenant makes efforts to immediately clean it up. That is what spot cleaning products are for. But the typical user of an airbnb unit is not in the same position as the reasonably prudent tenant. For an airbnb user, the unit is akin to a hotel room. I would not expect the typical airbnb consumer to travel with cleaning products and no evidence was led here that there were products in the unit available for a traveller’s use. 69. The photographs of the bedroom carpet taken by both parties show heavy staining that is consistent with multiple careless spills of liquid that were not tended to or spot cleaned in a timely manner. Although I do not have photographs of the carpet after it was cleaned I have no reason to doubt the Landlord’s testimony that the carpets remain stained after professional cleaning. 70. In other words, although it is normal for a landlord to have to vacuum and clean carpets on turnover, it is not normal for the carpets to be this badly stained after a tenancy of less than two years. The damage to the carpets is excessive and therefore, I find it is undue. It is also consistent with behaviour on the part of the Tenant’s guests that can only be described as careless; there were repeated spills of liquids not properly attended to or spot cleaned in a timely and reasonable manner. 71. The same analysis is equally applicable to the wooden floors, the silicone in the shower enclosure, the vertical blinds, and the painted surfaces. 72. The pictures of the wooden flooring are consistent with heavy objects like suitcases being carelessly dragged across them. Some sort of build-up is visible in pictures entered into evidence consistent with someone spilling some sort of glue or plasticized product that then set and hardened. 73. Mildew grows on silicone in showers but it takes years to get to the state this shower was in unless it is not cleaned with bleach based cleaners or there is a serious ventilation problem. No evidence was led of a ventilation problem in this bathroom so I am satisfied that the cleaning done during the tenancy was done in a negligent manner because proper cleaning products were not used. 74. The pictures of the blinds show multiple individual slats were damaged and could not be used. Most of the damage is to the top of the slat where the piece connects with the frame but at least one is split at the bottom. In the closed position, the blinds show clear gaps where pieces are missing. 75. Again, with normal use, individual vertical blind slats will get damaged from opening and closing. Again, the degree of the damage will increase with the carelessness of the user. The number of broken and damaged slats visible in the Landlords’ photographs is excessive given a tenancy of less than two years and is more consistent with repeated instances of careless and negligent use. 76. The photographs show chips in the painted finishes, scuff marks, and stains. Some of that is normal and typical but the degree and amount of those kinds of marks as shown in the photographs supports the conclusion that the Tenant’s airbnb guests were repeatedly less than careful about moving around the unit. 77. So with respect to the wooden floors, the silicone in the shower enclosure, the blinds and the painted surfaces in the unit, I am satisfied that some if not all of the damage is undue and caused in part by carelessness or negligent use or neglect. 78. With respect to the shower door, no evidence was led as to how the door came off its hinges and it was easily repaired. Given the nature of how such doors work, and my experience of like similar cases before the Board, this kind of problem is consistent with both normal use and negligent use. As a result, absent additional evidence, I am not prepared to make a finding that the damage was excessive or out of the ordinary or more consistent with negligence then ordinary usage. So the claim with respect to the shower door must be dismissed. The evidence is insufficient to establish the damage is undue. 79. The real difficulty that arises here is with respect to assessing the quantum the Landlords are entitled to for the reasonable cost of repair or replacement where repair is not reasonable. 80. The task is easiest with respect to the knobs for the stove and the carpet. 81. According to the invoices filed, the Landlords were able to purchase replacement knobs on-line at $25.80 each plus shipping and HST. For some unknown reason the invoice shows the Landlords purchased three although the evidence indicates only two were broken. This price is clearly a reasonable amount for replacement knobs so I am satisfied the Landlords are entitled to an order for two-thirds of the invoice filed or $74.83. The evidence is unclear what if any amount was incurred for labour costs related to replacing the knobs so no amount shall be ordered for labour. 82. As stated above, I accept the Landlords’ evidence that the carpet cannot in fact be repaired as the stains cannot be removed. As a result, the Landlords are entitled to the reasonable cost the Landlords will incur for replacing the carpet. The fact the Landlords have not yet replaced the carpet because they could not afford it but still managed to re-rent the unit does not negate their entitlement to that amount. 83. I would observe at this point that the wording of s. 89(1) indicates the Landlords are not entitled to both the reasonable cost of repair and the reasonable cost of replacement. So the Landlords are not entitled to an order for the cost of cleaning the carpet. 84. The Landlords provided a quote from their contractor for future replacement of the carpet of $2,400.00 plus HST of 13%. No evidence was led to suggest this is an unreasonable amount, and based on my experience of like claims I am not prepared to say that it is so an order shall issue requiring the Tenant to pay to the Landlord $2,431.20 for replacing the carpet. 85. The Landlords paid $550.00 plus HST to remove and replace the silicone in the shower enclosure. 86. As stated above, some staining of the silicone would be expecting from normal prudent use and cleaning. In other words, some of the damage is undue and some is not. As the Tenant can only be held responsible for the part that is undue some apportionment of responsibility for the cost of replacing the silicone is appropriate. 87. Given the photographs filed and my experience of like similar cases before the Board I am of the view that about 80% of the mildew damage caused is attributable to the Tenant’s behaviour in failing to use appropriate cleaning products. As a result, the Tenant shall be ordered to pay to the Landlords 80% of the cost of replacing the silicone or $445.72. 88. A similar apportionment exercise would be appropriate with respect to the damage to the floors, the painted surfaces, and the blinds. 89. I should observe at this point that the parties provided me with dozens of photographs of the state of the unit at the end of the tenancy. Without them it would have been impossible for the Board to assess how much of the damage can be attributed to normal wear and tear and how much is excessive or undue. 90. Having examined those pictures carefully, and taking into account my experience of like similar cases, it seems to me that 80% of the damage to the flooring is undue, as is 40% of the damage to the painted surfaces and 90% of the damage to the blinds. 91. The vertical blinds were repaired at a cost of $450.00 plus HST and I am satisfied that is a reasonable amount. So an order will issue requiring the Tenant to pay to the Landlord $364.68 for the undue damage to the blinds. 92. With respect to the damage to the painted surfaces, the Landlord paid $550.00 plus HST, but that amount included an unknown amount for “adjust kitchen hardware etc” and no evidence was led as to how much of the total was with respect to the painted surfaces and how much was not. As a result, it is not possible to assess how much of that cost is attributable to the undue damage caused by the negligent conduct of the Tenant, an occupant or a guest. 93. That being said, I am satisfied some costs were incurred by the Landlords as a result of undue damage to the painted surfaces, so in the absence of sufficient evidence that would enable the Board to quantify it, it would be appropriate to award a nominal amount which I fix at $25.00. 94. With respect to the engineered wood flooring the Landlords obtained a quote “to repair damaged hardwood floor in the living room, or to replace if necessary” for $1,100.00 plus HST. Given my experience of the cost to replace flooring of this kind this is a reasonable amount, so the Tenant will be ordered to pay to the Landlords $891.44 which represents 80% of the cost the Landlords will incur to repair the flooring. 95. That leaves the claim for compensation with respect to the changing of the lock. 96. Although I can understand why the Landlords changed the lock and can appreciate it was probably prudent to do so, there was nothing wrong with the lock. It was not damaged or in a state of disrepair. Subsection 89(1) only addresses actual damage to the rental unit or residential complex. This amount is not recoverable under the Act. Conclusion 97. Finally, the Landlords incurred costs of $175.00 for filing the application and are entitled to reimbursement of those costs. 98. This order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued. It is ordered that: 1. The Tenant’s application is dismissed. 2. The Landlords’ application filed pursuant to s. 69 is dismissed without prejudice. 3. The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $4,232.87 for compensation for undue damage. 4. The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $175.00 for the cost of filing the application. 5. The total amount the Tenant owes the Landlords under this order is $4,407.87. 6. If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount owing on or before August 4, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from August 5, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
