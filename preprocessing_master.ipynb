This application was heard in Mississauga on January 4, 2017. The Landlord's Legal Representative, B R and the Tenant, O S (OS) and the Tenant’s brother S S attended the hearing. The Tenant stated that Tenant R S has been living in Ottawa for the last year and a half and is no longer in possession of the unit. The Landlord stated they were not aware of that fact. Since the Tenant’s uncontested evidence indicates that R S was not in possession of the unit at the time of the application, he was removed as a party. Determinations: 1.  The Tenant has not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period from November 1, 2016 to January 31, 2017. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective November 24, 2016. 2.  The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,084.74 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord. 3.  Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2016 to November 24, 2016. 4.  The Tenant paid $700.00 after the application was filed. 5.  The Tenant OW was seeking a little extra time to pay and the Landlord did not strenuously object to extending the void date to January 20, 2016. 6.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant a brief relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. It is ordered that: 1.  Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before January 20, 2017. 2.  The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $807.37*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January 9, 2017, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit. 3.  The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $37.31 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 10, 2017 to the date they move out of the unit. 4.  The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $170.00 for the cost of filing the application. 5.  If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 20, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 21, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding. 6.  If the unit is not vacated on or before January 20, 2017, then starting January 21, 2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced. 7.  Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 21, 2017. 8.  If, on or before January 20, 2017, the Tenant pays the amount of $2,874.76** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced. 9.  The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after January 21, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.

       "[\"The N5 Notice has a termination date of November 17, 2016 and alleges that the conduct of the Tenant substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex and the Tenant has wilfully or negligently damaged the rental unit or residential complex. 5. The N5 Notice sets out the dates, times and specific allegations against the Tenant. 6. Because this is a first N5 Notice, the Tenant has an opportunity to void the notice in accordance with section 64(3) of the Act by correcting the identified problems within seven days of the date the notice was served. In this case, the seven day period begins the day following service of the N5 Notice, from October 28th to November 3rd, 2016. The Landlord's Legal Representative confirmed that the first N5 Notice was not voided because the conduct has not stopped since the notice was served and the Tenant has not paid $500.00 required to replace or replace the damaged property. Window screens 7. The Tenant negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit and residential complex by damaging the screens on two windows and the patio door. The photos submitted into evidence support a finding of negligence because the screens were badly torn which did not occur from usual wear and tear. The Landlord is entitled to the cost claimed of $300.00 to repair the window screens. The Landlord provided an invoice to support this claim. Conduct issues 8. The conduct of the Tenant substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the Landlord and other tenant for the following reasons: 9. The City of Mississauga issued a Notice of Contravention in April 2016 regarding debris located on the property because of the Tenant’s failure to properly store her garbage. A copy of the Notice was submitted; 10. The City of Mississauga also informed the Landlord about a noise complaint because the Tenant’s dog was barking for hours while left unattended in the backyard disturbing the neighbours. The Landlord submitted a copy of this letter into evidence; 11. Based on the testimony of the Landlord, the Tenant parks in the adjacent neighbour’s driveway and the Landlord receives complaints from the neighbour; 12. On August 29th the Tenant left her dog unattended in a common area of the residential complex and the Landlord was unable to show the unit to prospective renters. The Tenant fails to respond to the Landlord’s requests to control her dog. The Landlord submitted a text message sent to the Tenant regarding this issue on October 27th; 13. The Tenant installed a lock on the gate to the shared backyard and refused to remove the lock. The Landlord submitted a text message sent to the Tenant on August 23rd requesting a key to which the Tenant responded with foul language to leave her alone. Consequently the Landlord changed the lock and provided the tenants with keys; 14. The Tenant changed the lock on the entry door to the basement unit without the Landlord’s consent. Section 35 of the Act specifies that a tenant shall not alter the locking system on a door giving entry to a rental unit or residential complex without the consent of the Landlord. The Landlord is entitled to her costs for installing a new lock of $200.00 which she supported with an invoice; 15. The Tenant leaves her clothes in the laundry room and leaves kitty litter under the sink such that it interferes with the use of the laundry room by the other tenant. The Landlord has received numerous complaints from the other tenant regarding inability to do laundry and despite the creation of a laundry schedule, the issue continues. Photos of the laundry room and text messages reporting the issues were submitted into evidence; 16. The Tenant plays loud music and makes excessive noise at late hours. These incidents occurred on November 21st, 25th and 29th and continue on a regular basis. The Tenant yells and swears at the Landlord and the downstairs tenant. In support of this testimony, the Landlord submitted text messages. The downstairs tenant, LD testified about the ongoing issues with interference with laundry, loud arguments with the tenant and the tenant’s threat to turn her dog loose on him. LD also played an audio of one of the arguments in which the Tenant was heard yelling loudly and aggressively. He said the Tenant also forced open the entry door to his unit in November and began screaming at him. LD called the police; 17. LD also testified that he complained to the City of Mississauga about the noise but the Tenant’s behaviour continues. He said he would move out if the Tenant continues to live at the rental unit. Illegal Act (N6) 18. On October 27, 2016, the Landlord served the Tenant with an N6 Notice to End your Tenancy for Illegal Acts in accordance with section 61(1) of the Act. The N6 Notice has a termination date of November 17, 2016 and alleges that the Tenant physically assaulted the downstairs tenant on October 22, 2016. 19. The Tenant committed an illegal act by placing her fingers on LD’s face and pushing him on September 17th, 2016 which constitutes assault. The police were called. While the notice specified that an assault occurred on October 22nd, 2016 the testimony was that the conduct complained of occurred on September 17th. However the notice provided the Tenant with sufficient details to understand the allegation. Relief from eviction 20. The Landlord seeks eviction as soon as possible. The other tenant intends to move because of the unrelenting issues he experiences on a daily basis because of the Tenant’s conduct. 21. No circumstances were disclosed in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act to consider relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act\",\n",
       " \"I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.

This tenancy just commenced in July 2016 and the Tenant has been unable or unwilling to pay the rent on time and/or in full each month since then. A prior L1 rent arrears order was issued in October 2016. The Tenant was able to pay the amount owing by the date in the order which voided the order. However, immediately after that, he fell into arrears for the November rent. 19. The Tenant stated he was injured in an accident shortly after he moved in and was off work. However, he is now back at work and hopes to pay the amount owing by the end of February. 20. The Tenant still has the option set out below in paragraph 9 of the order if he wants to preserve this tenancy\",\n",
       " \"I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsections 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. I have extended the termination date to February 28th to allow the Tenants time to seek out other resources which may be available to them to void the arrears portion of the order. This extension is only two weeks longer than requested by the Landlord's Legal Representative to reduce the prejudice to the Landlord. The Tenants are required to void the rent arrears portion of the order to benefit from a condition to pay the rent on time with a section 78 provision where the Landlord can file for eviction if a payment of rent is late without notice to the Tenants\",\n",
       " 'On December 2, 2016, the Landlord served the Tenant with an N5 Notice in accordance with sub sections 64(1) and 62(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). The N5 Notice has a termination date of December 22, 2016 and alleges that: a) The Tenant is harassing and substantially interfering with the reasonable enjoyment of the Landlord through numerous phone calls, voicemails and unannounced visits to the Landlord’s home; b) The Tenant damaged the front room ceiling, walls and floor due to “brewing kegs of homemade wine” which exploded all over the room. The Landlord claimed $320.00 to repair the alleged property damage. 4. The N5 Notice sets out the dates, times and specific allegations against the Tenant. 5. Because this is a first N5 Notice, the Tenant has an opportunity to void the notice in accordance with sub section 64(3) of the Act by correcting the identified problems within seven days of the date the notice was served. In this case, the seven day period begins the day following service of the N5 Notice, from December 3, 2016 to December 9, 2016. The Landlord confirmed that the N5 Notice was not voided and that the Tenant did not pay $320.00 for the alleged damages claimed in the N5 notice. 6. The Landlord testified: a) The Tenant is her biological father; b) The Tenant was brewing wine in the front room of the home and the red wine “exploded” and stained the ceiling, walls and floor. The Landlord submitted photos of the front room; c) The Landlord gave notice to enter to replace the battery for the furnace and the Tenant denied entry and police were called; d) The Tenant is not co-operative and verbally abusive such that the Landlord went to the police. He withheld rent in return for personal favours, forced his way in and used the Landlord’s cottage, requested help in paying bills and constantly calls the Landlord with unreasonable requests. He does not respect boundaries. He caused a “scene” when the roof was re-shingled and damaged the workers’ truck. When he comes to her house, he throws temper tantrums. 7. The Tenant admitted responsibility for the red wine stains on the ceiling of the front room. He testified that the container of red wine was corked and the cork popped causing wine to spray on the ceiling. He said he paid his grandson to clean the stains. Wilful or negligent damage – front room 8. Section 62(1) of the Act states that a landlord may give a tenant notice of termination if the tenant wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to the rental unit. 9. I am not satisfied that the conduct of the Tenant was negligent or that the wine stains on the ceiling is representative of undue damage. 10. “Conduct is negligent if there is a risk of damage which a reasonable person would take reasonable precautions against” (Bolton v. Stone [1951] A.C. 850). Further, “If a person reasonably, albeit mistakenly, believes that there is no risk then the conduct is not negligent” (Beutler v. Beutler [1983] O.J. No. 505 at para. 148). 11. Wilful conduct means with intent or deliberate. 12. The Tenant placed a cork in the container of wine which shows that he took reasonable precautions against spillage. The fact that the cork popped and caused the wine to spray the ceiling and spill onto the floor was not reasonably foreseeable. As a consequence, the Tenant’s conduct was not negligent. The facts do not demonstrate any intent by the Tenant to spray wine on the ceiling and floor. 13. I am not satisfied that the stains on the ceiling and the faint spot on the floor are representative of undue damage. Undue suggests some damage is acceptable. The stains on the ceiling and floor are akin to normal wear and tear. 14. As the Landlord has not met the test under section 62(1), this claim is dismissed. In any event, the Landlord did not substantiate the remedy claimed of $320.00 with a quote or other similar evidence. 15. The Landlord’s claim regarding damage caused by hooks on a ceiling beam is dismissed because the Landlord did not explain how the hooks caused undue damage. Substantial interference 16. Asking someone to read your mail to them, show them how to pay bills, smoke fish for them and not respecting boundaries indicates that the Landlord’s allegations are representative of personal issues between members of a family rather than those between a Landlord and Tenant. This does not represent substantial interference of reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex by the Landlord or harassment and this claim is dismissed. 17. The issues claimed by the Landlord that occurred at her home did not occur at the residential complex and therefore do not substantially interfere with her reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex. This claim is dismissed. 18. The Landlord’s claim that the Tenant damaged the roofing worker’s truck is dismissed. The Landlord did not provide sufficient details regarding this claim or any supporting evidence regarding this alleged damage. 19. The Landlord did not provide sufficient details such as dates and times, to support a finding of harassment or substantial interference regarding her complaints that the Tenant demanded she come over to change a light bulb, wanted a new kitchen tap and made numerous calls regarding the thermostat “flashing”. These claims are dismissed. 20. The Landlord failed to substantiate her claim regarding denial of entry to the rental unit to replace the battery for the furnace on December 1, 2016. A notice to enter was not provided and no details regarding police involvement were submitted. In any event, a single event is not indicative of substantial interference. This claim is dismissed. 21. The Landlord led evidence that the Tenant failed to maintain the unit in a state of ordinary cleanliness. However, these issues were not raised in the N5 Notices which formed the basis of the L2 Application and are not relevant to a finding of a substantial interference or wilful or negligent damage. Regarding L2 Application (N12 Notice – Landlord own use) 22. The Landlord served the Tenant with an N12 notice of termination effective January 31, 2017 claiming the Landlord intended to move into the rental unit. 23. The Landlord testified that she intends to move into the rental unit to use the unit for her home based business and for other business purposes. 24. Subsection 48(1) of the Act states: A landlord may, by notice, terminate a tenancy if the landlord in good faith requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation by, (a) the landlord; (b) the landlord’s spouse; (c) a child or parent of the landlord or the landlord’s spouse; or (d) a person who provides or will provide care services to the landlord, the landlord’s spouse, or a child or parent of the landlord or the landlord’s spouse, if the person receiving the care services resides or will reside in the building, related group of buildings, mobile home park or land lease community in which the rental unit is located. 25. The term “residential occupation” is not defined in the Act. However, the Court has stated in various decisions that residential occupation is generally understood to mean the property will be used as the person’s main residence and requires more than occasional or temporary use of the unit. 26. Based on the Landlord’s evidence, the test of residential occupation has not been met. It is clear from the Landlord’s own evidence that the property will not be the main residence of the Landlord and she intends to use the unit for business purposes, not residential occupation. This claim is dismissed. Relief from eviction (L1 Application) 27. The Tenant testified that his source of income is retirement benefits of about $1,800 per month. He has a hearing impairment and relies on oxygen for breathing purposes. If evicted, he requested until April to find another home. 28. The Landlord said that she will lose her house if the arrears are not paid because she is using credit to pay bills and the mortgage. 29. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. 30. In granting relief, I am taking into account the submissions of the Landlord and her financial obligations, and balancing that against the Tenant’s disclosed circumstances. Therefore the relief from eviction is subject to conditions set out in this order which, if not met, would allow the Landlord to apply to the Board, without further notice to the Tenant, for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant pursuant to section 78 of the Act',\n",

The Tenant stated that she is looking for a new place to move and wants to move as soon as possible but, as of the hearing date, she was not certain of an exact date she will be moving. She is currently unable to make any payment towards the three months of rent that are owing. As a result, termination of the tenancy is ordered\",\n",

THE APPLICATION BASED ON THE TENANT’S NOTICE TO TERMINATE 7. The Landlord’s application for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant based on the assertion that the Tenant gave notice to terminate must be dismissed. The Tenant did not give notice to terminate the tenancy to the Landlord in compliance with the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). 8. Rather the parties exchanged a number of text messages and in one of them the Tenant said he would remove his possessions from the unit before February 1, 2017. 9. This text does not constitute a valid notice to terminate in that it does not meet the following requirements of the Act: it does not state a date for termination that is the last day of a month of the tenancy (s. 44); 60 days’ notice was not provided (s. 44); it is not in the Board’s prescribed form (s. 43(1)); it is not signed (s. 43(1)(c)); and it does not identify the rental unit (s. 43(1)(a)). 10. There was also no written agreement to terminate and the Tenant remains in possession of the rental unit. 11. As a result, the Landlord’s application under s. 77 of the Act must be dismissed\",\n",

The Tenants stated that they can pay the amount owing within 11 days. Landlord’s Own Use of the Basement Unit 13. The Landlord served the Tenants with a valid N12 notice of termination effective May 31, 2017. 14. The property is a bungalow with two separate units. The Tenants rent the basement unit. The Landlord resides in the upper unit with his wife and three children ages 16, 15 and 10. 15. The Landlord’s wife deals with the Tenants for most of the matters involved in the tenancy. She is having surgery in the near future for severe arthritis in her knee. Medical documentation was provided to support this. She will require modifications to the bathroom to assist her after her surgery. There is only one bathroom on the upper floor. The Landlord, his wife and their three children share the one bathroom. 16. The Landlord intends to return the property to a single family home. He requires the extra space in the basement for two reasons. One, so that there will be a second bathroom available for his family’s use; and two, so his two teenaged sons will no longer have to share a bedroom upstairs. 17. The Landlord provided documentation to establish that one of his sons has autism. The shared bedroom arrangement between his two sons is no longer working now that the boys are older and they need their own rooms. 18. The Landlord, in good faith, requires the rental unit for his own use to accommodate the needs of his family. The property will be returned to a single family home. 19. The test of good faith is whether the Landlord has a genuine intention to occupy the rental unit for his own use (Salter v Beljinac 2001 CanLII 40231 (ON SCDC), [2001] O.J. No. 2792 Div Ct). I find that the Landlord has this genuine intention. 20. The Landlord has provided the affidavit required by section 72 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) stating that he needs the rental unit for his own use. 21. The Tenants question the good faith of the Landlord. There is no dispute that the landlord/tenant relationship has become tense. The police have been called by both sides for various disputes between the Tenants and the Landlord’s wife. 22. The Tenants state that they have received six N12 notices of termination over the past few months and two N4 notices. They consider this to be harassment. 23. The notices of termination that the Landlord issued do not amount to harassment. 24. The two N4’s are for the same rent arrears. There was just one copy issued to each Tenant separately. The N4 notices were only issued due to the undisputed rent arrears. There is nothing improper in the issuing of the N4 notices. 25. The six N12 notices really only amount to three. Three N12’s were issued with one separate copy for each Tenant. There were defects or deficiencies in the prior N12 notices. The last N12 notice issued (with a separate copy for each Tenant) is valid and is the basis for this L2 application. 26. The Tenants attempted to raise other issues regarding harassment such as a parking issue. However, this issue was already determined in a prior Board application (TET-72567-16) and cannot be raised for a second time. 27. There is no question or dispute that the tenancy is problematic and the relationship been the Landlord’s wife and the Tenants is no longer functioning. The Tenants claim that this is the real reason for the N12 notices. However, this does not amount to bad faith. There is nothing improper about a Landlord deciding that he no longer wants to rent his unit anymore. As long as he genuinely intends to use the rental unit for his (and his family’s) own residential use, the test of good faith has been met. 28. The Tenants claim that they have had no heat and hot water over the winter months. This issue was considered for the purpose of determining whether the Landlord is in serious breach of his obligations under the Act. Subsection 83(3)(a) of the Act states that the eviction application must be refused if the Landlord is in serious breach. 29. The Landlord is not in serious breach regarding the heat or hot water. The Tenants have hot water. They just do not consider it to be hot enough at times or sufficient in quantity for a long shower. The Tenants also have heat. However, the upper unit controls the thermostat and it is not always set to a temperature the Tenants would prefer. 30. The Tenant argue that the Landlord gave them the N12 notice in March 2017 because they called the City about the unregistered basement apartment in February. 31. Subsection 83(3)(b) of the Act states that the Board must refuse the eviction application if the reason the application was brought is because the tenant complained to a government authority about the landlord’s violation of a law. 32. It is important to note the wording used in subsection 83(3)(b) of the Act. It states that the complaint made must be the reason for the application not just a reason. 33. The evidence does not suggest that the complaint that the Tenants made to the City was the reason for the eviction application. Prior N12 notices were given to the Tenants before the complaint was even made. Even if the complaint to the City formed some part of the reason for the Landlord’s wish to stop renting the basement and use it for himself and his family, the additional reasons for the application are the need for more space due to the changing needs of the Landlord’s children and the requirement for a second bathroom for the family after his wife’s surgery. 34. Regarding the L2 application: I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until June 30, 2017 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. The Tenants do not want to move. They stated that they live on a fixed income and rental rates have increased significantly in their area. This delay will give the Tenants some time to organize their move. 35. However, this delay will only be applicable if the Tenants pay the amount required to void the rent arrears portion of this order. If that amount is paid, the last month's rent deposit would be applied to the June rent\",\n",
       " 'Section 83 10. Having considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, I find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. 11. This is the second application by the Landlord in less than one year to collect the rent arrears that are currently substantial. The Landlord is unable to financially maintain this property. The Landlord is required to pay the mortgage and the taxes regularly while the Tenant continues to occupy the premises. 12. The Tenant requested that the eviction be stayed or refused pending the outcome of the Superior Court of Justice decision as it would be unfair for the Tenant to lose occupancy of the premises whilst the argument for ownership proceeds at the Courts. 13. The Divisional Court in Lomico 188 Inc. v. David Mouritsen and Irina Mouritsen 2014 ONSC 2442 (CanLII) Div. Crt. File No.: 541/13 has determined that the Board’s jurisdiction to hear an application to terminate the tenancy for arrears of rent is not ousted by reason of a pending action in the Superior Court involving the same tenancy. 14. The eviction order is remedial upon payment of the rent owed in accordance with the signed tenancy agreement between the parties. This is the Tenant’s second application before the Board within one year for substantial rent arrears. The Tenant’s application before the Superior Court of Justice was only filed in recent weeks. L2 application 15. The N5 notice of termination at the root of this application was filed pursuant to section 64 of the Act. Subsection 64(1) of the Act states the following: A landlord may give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy if the conduct of the tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the tenant is such that it substantially interferes with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex for all usual purposes by the landlord or another tenant or substantially interferes with another lawful right, privilege or interest of the landlord or another tenant. 16. The issue in the N5 notice is regarding the Landlord inability to access the premises as the Tenant has refused access, changed the lock and failed to provide a key to the Landlord. There was no dispute that the Tenant only recently provided the Landlord with a key to the rental unit. 17. Based on the evidence before me, I am not satisfied that the Tenant has continued to refuse access to the rental unit by the Landlord. According to the Landlord a notice of entry was provided to the Tenant, however she made a typographical error in the date. Unfortunately, given that the typographical error was the date of the notice, it stated May 5, 2017, and the notice simply stated that the Landlord requires entry in 24 hours, I find that the Landlord’s attempt to enter on May 4, 2017 was not in compliance with the notice. Section 83 18. Having considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, I find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act given that the Landlord has obtained a key from the Tenant. L8 application 19. There was no dispute that the Tenant complied with interim order CEL-65920-17 issued April 26, 2017 and provided the Landlord with a key to the rental unit on May 3, 2017. The parties agreed that this issue was resolved. Consequently the application is dismissed',\n",

Although the Tenant requested two months to pay the amount that she owes to the Landlord, I find that it is reasonable to postpone the eviction date to only July 31, 2017. It is appropriate to postpone the eviction date because of the Landlords’ failure to provide the Tenant with rent receipts. However, I also find that it is not appropriate to postpone the eviction date beyond July 31, 2017, because the Tenant elected to spend the rent money she withheld from the Landlords on other items. Under the circumstances, it would be unfair to the Landlords to postpone the eviction date beyond July 31, 2017, as doing so could result in the accrual of additional rent arrears. 8.

Regarding the L2 application N5 Notice of termination 4. The N5 notice of termination was served on the Tenant pursuant to section 64 of the Act. Subsection 64(3) of the Act states: The notice of termination under subsection (1) is void if the tenant, within seven days after receiving the notice, stops the conduct or activity or corrects the omission. 5. There were only three issues listed on the N5 notice. The first related to an incident on April 9, 2017 involving police services. This was a one-time occurrence and this conduct had not continued. Therefore, I am satisfied that this issue in the N5 notice was corrected. Of the two remaining issues in the N5 notice the Landlord chose not to proceed with the allegation of the failure to maintain the exterior of the rental unit. 6. The final issue related to an allegation that the Tenant rented the basement at the rental unit. In regards to this issue, the evidence before me was insufficient to find that the Tenant has rented out the basement to another tenant. The Landlord only suspected that the basement was rented because another person was seen at the property. However, the Tenant confirmed that this person is his relative. N12 Notice of termination 7. The Landlord stated that her in-laws, who currently reside with her and her husband, would like to move into the rental unit. They lived in the rental unit previously and formed relationships within that community. Her eldest child is able to care for his younger sibling, and her in-laws are no longer needed to care for the children in her home. 8. MP testified at the hearing, and although there was some difficulty with the translation from Hindi, which is spoken by both the Landlord and the Tenant, to English, MP confirmed that he planned to reside at the rental unit to be closer to friends and part-take in community gatherings in the park near the unit. MP also stated that he is looking forward to mental peace. 9. The Tenant disputed the intention of MP to reside at the unit. He submitted that the Landlord’s in-laws have not resided in the rental unit for two years, and ought to have assimilated to their new community. Further, he believes that he was served with the N12 notice because he refused to agree to a rent increase proposed by the Landlord. 10. According to the Tenant, just prior to the lease renewal, the Landlord approached him for renewal at a significantly higher rent. At that time, he refused to renew for another one-year term at this new rent because he could not afford to pay that amount. Then he received a N12 notice of termination. 11. The test of good faith is whether the Landlord (or a permitted person) has a genuine intention to occupy the rental unit for their own use (Salter v Beljinac 2001 CanLII 40231 (ON SCDC), [2001] O.J. No. 2792 Div Ct). The motives of the Landlord, the fact that there may be other options available or the reasonableness of their plans are not relevant to the test of good faith. 12. Based on the evidence before me, I am satisfied that there is a genuine intention for the Landlord’s in-laws to move into the rental unit after the Tenant vacates the unit. The Landlord stated that when the Tenant did not renew the tenancy, her in-laws made the decision to move. While the Tenant offered reasonable suspicions, which are genuinely held by him, they remain mere suspicions. I am not satisfied that they are sufficient to cast significant doubt on the Landlord’s in-laws intentions. The Landlord’s in-laws provided the affidavits required by section 72 of the Act and MP testified at the hearing regarding their intention. 13. Therefore, I find that the Landlord in good faith requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation by her in-laws. 14. The Tenant resides in the rental unit with his wife, two children and another relative. He has not found an alternative rental unit and stated that moving would not be easy. 15. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until December 31, 2017 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act to allow the Tenant a further reasonable opportunity to find alternate accommodations given that he Landlord’s in-laws can continue to reside with her and her family in the interim\",\n",

       " 'A preliminary review of the review request was completed without a hearing in accordance with Rule 29.11 of the Board’s Rules of Practice. Determinations: 1. The Tenants attended the hearing that took place on January 25, 2018. Their tenancy was terminated in order CEL-71370-17, issued on January 30, 2018. However, the eviction or move out date was delayed by one month to February 28, 2018. 2. The Tenants are understandably disappointed with that result. Yet, a review is not an opportunity to reargue your case in hopes of a more favourable outcome. Nor is it an opportunity to present evidence and submissions that could and should have been presented at the original hearing. 3. On the basis of the submissions made in the request, and after listening to the recording of the hearing, I am not satisfied that there is a serious error in the order or that a serious error occurred in the proceedings. 4. The Tenants allege that there is a serious error in the order because the order fails to give adequate reasons for the determinations made by the Member. In particular, they allege that the order should have stated the exact amount of utilities that the Tenants owe to the Landlord. This does not amount to a serious error. 5. The order does not require the Tenants to pay the Landlord the amount of the unpaid utilities. Therefore, stating the exact amount was not necessary. The N5 Notice of Termination and the application state the exact amount of unpaid utilities the Landlord claims is owing. The Board’s file and the recording of the hearing reveal that the Landlord provided a spread sheet at the hearing which identified the amount owing as of the hearing date. As a result, the Tenants were aware of the amount that was claimed to be owing. Also, paragraph 12 of the review request reveals that the Tenants were aware of the amount for unpaid utilities since they refer to the amount as “only a little more than…the Tenants’ monthly rent.” 6. The failure to provide full reasons for the determinations made does not amount to a serious error that would justify a review of the order. The Board hears a very large volume of cases. Due to this volume, full reasons for the decision are not provided with every order. However, Rule 26.2 of the Board’s Rules of Practice states that a party can request reasons for the decision within 30 days of the order. If the Tenants required more detailed reasons they could have requested those reasons. There is no record of any such request. 7. The Tenants allege that the Member failed to fully consider their circumstances under section 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, (the ‘Act’). They state that they have a fixed, limited income, have three young children and a move will be difficult for the family. The hearing recording reveals that the Member asked the Tenants more than once near the conclusion of the hearing if there was anything else they wanted to say or add to their evidence. The Tenants had a full opportunity to explain all of their circumstances. Paragraph 9 of the order reveals that the Tenants’ family circumstances were considered and this was the reason for the delayed eviction date 8. The remedies that are ordered, including the termination or eviction date, are within the discretion of the Member who heard all of the evidence and submissions from both the Landlord and the Tenants. The reasonable exercise of discretion will not be interfered with on review. 9. The N5 Notice of Termination that the Landlord’s application is based on is dated October 11, 2017 with a termination date of November 2, 2017. The N5 notice alleges that the Tenant have failed to pay the utility bills from February 2017 to October 2017. The Tenants allege that it was a serious error for the Member to consider the state of the utility accounts as of the January 25, 2018 hearing date and only the timeframe in the N5 notice should have been considered. 10. This is not a serious error. The Member is required, under section 83 of the Act, to consider all of the circumstances in deciding whether to terminate the tenancy. For example, if the utility accounts were fully paid by the hearing date, the Member may have determined that relief from eviction would not be unfair. Therefore, events that have occurred since the application was filed may be considered if they are relevant to the issues in the application. 11.

I am satisfied that a delay until the end of June 2018 provides a sufficient time frame for the Tenants to find accommodation without significant prejudice the Landlords’ daughter. The Landlords’ daughter is still able to attend university, her employment and her volunteer position from her current residence in the interim. 17. The Landlords have paid the Tenants the required compensation pursuant to section 48.1 of the Act. Regarding CET-73173-18 T2 application 18. In this application, the Tenants alleged that the Landlords harassed the Tenants, substantially interfered with the Tenants’ reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit and withheld or deliberately interfered with a vital service. A number of the Tenants’ issues in this application also related to the Tenants’ T6 application with respect to the Landlords’ failure to maintain the appliances and the furnace. Those allegations will be addressed in regards to the T6 application below. Harassment and Substantial Interference 19. The Tenants stated that they had a good relationship with the Landlords until the Landlords tried to increase the rent by $300.00-$400.00 in 2015. The Tenants were also upset that the Landlords demanded that the Tenants pay a rent deposit of $7,800.00 representing three months’ rent at the time at the commencement of the tenancy. As well, according to JM, in every conversation with the Landlords after the initial term of the tenancy, the Landlords complained that the “rent is too low” or “I am losing money.” 20. JM stated that they had to take care of everything on their own. It has only been in the last year that they put their foot down and now they feel like the Landlords are bullying them. The Tenants were extremely upset that MH made a racist comment towards DM when MH attended the rental unit on December 7, 2017. The comment to DM was something to the effect that MH only decided to replace the appliances “because you are married to a white man.” DM was concerned how she would be treated if she were not married to a white man. 21. MH denied making the above comment. MH provided her own version of the events on that day, December 7, 2017, when she attended the rental unit. She stated that DM grabbed her arm and stated that she is not leaving until she gives permission to replace the stove. MH also stated that it was on this day when she first advised the Tenants that her daughter wants to move into the rental unit. MH said she left the unit shaking. 22. The Landlords’ brother, BT, testified that he received a call from MH, who was crying, and advised that the Tenants wouldn’t allow her to leave. BT subsequently went to the rental unit that night. According to BT, DM was aggressive towards MH when they returned to the rental unit. BT also testified that DM said that MH “can’t speak English properly and she is a pharmacist.” 23. There was no dispute that the Landlords collected three months as a deposit in the initial tenancy agreement. The Tenants confirmed that at the time of entering the tenancy, they were going through bankruptcy proceedings and they paid the amount requested. The Landlords are no longer retaining these moneys and haven’t been for over one year, which is the time limitation for a tenant to make an application for illegal collection or retention of moneys by a landlord. 24. The Tenants have only raised the collection of the three month deposit and the demand for an unlawful increase after receiving the N12 notice. I am not satisfied that these two issues amount to a pattern of harassment. Not only are they separated by a time span of five years, but these issues most likely formed part of negotiations between the parties which in the end led to agreements. In the first instance, the written tenancy agreement and in the second instance, a guideline increase. JM confirmed after the Landlords initial request for a large increase, that he annually calculated the lawful increase in accordance with the guideline for the Landlords. 25. As far as the comments made by the Landlords regarding the rent being too low, I find it probable that the Landlords have made this comment in the past, however I am not satisfied that in any context it rose to the level of harassment. The Landlords never demanded more rent after the initial discussion in 2015, always accepted and allowed the Tenants to deduct repairs from the rent and addressed the Tenants concerns (other than the issue with the new appliances being inadequate according to the Tenants). 26. Based on the evidence before me, I find it more likely than not that this application for harassment and substantial interference only arose as a result of the Tenants’ displeasure with the new appliances at the rental unit and because they received the N12 notice of termination. 27. JM confirmed under cross examination that the parties’ agreement was for the Tenants to arrange and effect repairs as needed at the rental unit. The Tenants wanted some autonomy at the rental unit and didn’t want the Landlords attending the premises regularly. There was a demonstrated pattern of the Tenants contacting repair and service contractors, paying for the repair/service, then deducting the amounts from the rent as agreed. 28. Also, I am not satisfied that because the Landlords requested the Tenants help with measuring the old appliances, disconnecting them or having to store the old fridge for five days amounted to harassment or a substantial interference with their reasonable enjoyment of the premises. While it is the Landlords’ obligation to maintain the rental unit, asking or requiring the Tenants co-operation in achieving that does not amount to a substantial interference, especially not in the circumstances of this case. 29. As well, based on the evidence before me, I find it more likely than not that both parties made inappropriate and racist comments to one another during their confrontation at the rental unit on December 7, 2017. As such, I am not satisfied that only the Landlords should be held accountable for this shared inappropriate conduct. Especially since DM’s conduct was also physically aggressive towards MH. 30. Finally, I find it more likely than not that the Tenants conduct on December 7, 2017 was a result of finding out that the Landlords’ daughter would like to reside in the rental unit. The parties had a good relationship and understanding regarding the tenancy up to this date. MH testified that she rarely attended the rental unit and in fact prior to December 7, 2017 it had been months. The Tenants did not provide any specific dates regarding other confrontations with the Landlords, yet suggested that the Landlords are bullies. 31. The evidence before me did not support a finding that the Landlords bullied the Tenants. The Tenants complained about the appliances being too old and constantly breaking down at the end of October 2017, the Landlords replaced the appliances by mid-December 2017. This short timeframe does not demonstrate that the Landlords were refusing to act or holding out against the Tenants. Even after the physical confrontation between MH and DM on December 7, 2017, the Landlords decided to replace the stove and did so the following week. 32. The Landlords replaced the dishwasher and fridge at the rental unit on December 7, 2017. The stove was replaced on December 14, 2017 at the rental unit. According to the Tenants, these new appliances are inadequate for a family of six. They are smaller than the original appliances, the dishwasher cycle takes longer, and the stove is not self-cleaning. These issues with the new appliances were the subject of the Tenants’ email sent to the Landlords on December 14, 2017. The Tenants believe that the Landlords refusal to address these issues has led to a substantial interference with their reasonable enjoyment of the premises. 33. The Tenants’ Legal Representative argued that the Tenants are entitled to compensation as the Tenants’ had contracted for specific appliances that were subsequently replaced by the Landlords with diminished ones. While this argument may be correct, it must be made pursuant to section 130 of the Act. This T2 application filed pursuant to section 29 of the Act with remedies available pursuant to section 31 of the Act is not the relevant application. 34. Section 130 of the Act specifically contemplates that a landlord may unilaterally reduce or discontinue a service or facility that was originally provided and formed part of the tenancy agreement. If a landlord removes a service or facility the tenant may file the applicable application with the Board and request a rent reduction. That application is a T3 application. 35. Subsection 2(1) of the Act states: “services and facilities” includes, (a) furniture, appliances and furnishings, 36. I agree with and adopt the following reasoning as set out in order CET-68554-17-RV: a) Section 130 of the Act states: 130 (1)A tenant of a rental unit may apply to the Board for an order for a reduction of the rent charged for the rental unit due to a reduction or discontinuance in services or facilities provided in respect of the rental unit or the residential complex. Same, former tenant (2)A former tenant of a rental unit may apply under this section as a tenant of the rental unit if the person was affected by the discontinuance or reduction of the services or facilities while the person was a tenant of the rental unit. Order re lawful rent (3)The Board shall make findings in accordance with the prescribed rules and may order, (a) that the rent charged be reduced by a specified amount; (b) that there be a rebate to the tenant of any rent found to have been unlawfully collected by the landlord; (c) that the rent charged be reduced by a specified amount for a specified period if there has been a temporary reduction in a service. Same (4)An order under this section reducing rent takes effect on the day that the discontinuance or reduction first occurred. Same, time limitation (5)No application may be made under this section more than one year after a reduction or discontinuance in a service or facility. b) The amount of the rent reduction that a tenant may be entitled to is determined in accordance with the prescribed rules that are set out in section 39 of Ontario Regulation 516/06 (the ‘Regulation’) made under the Act. c) The Regulation sets out different rules for determining an appropriate rent reduction depending on whether a landlord’s removal or discontinuance of a service was reasonable or unreasonable. d) Therefore, whether a landlord’s removal of a service was reasonable or unreasonable, a tenant’s remedy is a rent reduction which is determined in accordance with the prescribed rules. e) The Tenants did not file a T3 application. They filed a T2 application claiming substantial interference. That claim is governed by sections 29 and 31 of the Act which permit different remedies to be requested and ordered. f) In this case, the Tenants were requesting that the free visitor’s parking be re-instated. That is not an available remedy under section 130 of the Act. g) I acknowledge that there may be circumstances where a reduction or discontinuance in a service or facility could potentially be characterized as a substantial interference with a tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex. However, in my view, it is not appropriate to permit that type of claim to be filed under a T2 application so that a tenant may circumvent section 130 of the Act and request a different remedy than what is provided for under the Act or to get around the one year limitation period set out in subsection 130(5) of the Act. h) Substantial interference with reasonable enjoyment is very broad and general claim and could potentially encompass any number of issues that could arise during a tenancy. However, when an issue raised in an application falls under a more specific and applicable section of the Act, the issue should be determined under that specific and applicable section. i) This is similar to the situation that arises when a tenant does not pay the rent that is due. There is an applicable process, remedy and application for rent arrears. Although a tenant’s failure to pay the rent could potentially be characterized or claimed as a substantial interference with a landlord’s reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex, the Board does not determine rent arrears issues under that type of claim. It requires a landlord to follow the applicable process and sections in the Act regarding rent arrears. 37. Consequently, to make a finding based on an application under section 29 of the Act instead of a finding based under section 130 disregards the statutory framework as the Act contemplates a change in a service or facility that is provided as part of the tenancy and the Act provides rules and remedies for such a change. Vital Services / T6 application Furnace 38. The Tenants stated that the house wasn’t heating properly. They believed there was an issue with the furnace. JM stated that in March 2017, the furnace broke down. A Reliance Home Services (Reliance) repairperson attended at that time and fixed the furnace. According to JM, they suggested the furnace be replaced. On April 29, 2017, the Tenants wrote to the Landlords that the furnace has rust on the inside and should be examined by a professional. 39. On December 7, 2017, the Tenants raised the issue with the furnace again while BT was at the unit. He testified that the Tenants complained about rust on the furnace. BT further testified that he asked them if they lost heat, but they just mentioned the rust. 40. On January 15, 2018, according to the Tenants, the furnace stopped working. The Tenants contacted the Landlords and called Reliance to attend to issue with the furnace. There was no dispute that the furnace was replaced within four days. The Tenants stated that they were without heat for those four days. 41. The Tenants stated that the appliances at the rental unit were old and not working properly. On October 30, 2017, they sent a letter to the Landlords advising that the fridge is not working properly, the dishwasher top rack can no longer be used as the side rollers are worn, and that the stove works but can still be “unpredictable.” In this letter, the Tenants asked if the Landlords would consider replacing the appliances. 42. There was no dispute that the fridge and dishwasher were replaced and installed on December 7, 2017. On December 7, 2017, while at the rental unit, the Tenants asked MH about the stove. According to the Tenants, the repair person advised them that the stove was a fire hazard, so they stopped using the stove at that point. 43. According to MH, only DM said that the stove was a fire hazard. The electrician installing the other appliances, inspected the stove and told MH to save yourself some problems and buy a new stove. BT stated that when he was at the unit that night, the Tenants complained about the knobs on the stove having no numbers; that it doesn’t work properly; and that it is a fire hazard because the kids can’t tell if the stove is on or not. According to BT the electrician told him there is a repair kit and the switch issue can be fixed but whatever fixes are done will not satisfy the Tenants. 44. Subsection 20(1) of the Act states the following: A landlord is responsible for providing and maintaining a residential complex, including the rental units in it, in a good state of repair and fit for habitation and for complying with health, safety, housing and maintenance standards. 45. Subsection 21(1) of the Act states the following: A landlord shall not at any time during a tenant’s occupancy of a rental unit and before the day on which an order evicting the tenant is executed, withhold the reasonable supply of any vital service, care service or food that it is the landlord’s obligation to supply under the tenancy agreement or deliberately interfere with the reasonable supply of any vital service, care service or food. 46. The evidence before me did not support a finding that the Landlords withheld or deliberately interfered with the vital service of heat. Although, it was not disputed that the Tenants did not have any heat for four days, this was related to the repair issue with the furnace not the actions of the Landlords. 47. The Ontario Court of Appeal in Onyskiw v. CJM Property Management Ltd. (2016 ONCA 477) has determined that landlord is not automatically in breach of their maintenance obligations as soon as a problem arises and a contextual approach is necessary in determining whether or not a landlord has breached their maintenance obligations under section 20 of the Act. That approach involves a consideration of the “entirety of the factual situation” before determining that a landlord is in breach of their maintenance obligations. 48. The evidence before me was insufficient to find that there was an issue with the heat at the rental unit prior to the furnace breaking down on January 15, 2018. The Tenants’ letter to the Landlords in April 2017 only stated an issue with rust and a concern that the furnace needed to be inspected. There were no other complaints verbally or in writing regarding any lack of heat in the rental unit until the furnace broke down. 49. The Landlords responded to the issue with the furnace, they immediately authorized a replacement. However, there was no dispute that there was no heat in the rental unit between January 15, 2018 and January 18, 2018 while the furnace was being replaced. Therefore, I find that the Landlord was in breach of their maintenance obligations under section 20 of the Act. 50. The Landlord did not ignore the issue, but the Tenants did not get what they paid for. The Tenants requested an abatement of rent of $400.00 for the four days they were without heat. 51. The monthly rent is $2,734.85. Therefore, the per diem (daily) rate is calculated at $89.91 ($2,734.85 x 12/365). Consequently, I find an abatement of rent of $359.64 equal to 100% for four days to be appropriate given that no heat at the rental unit in the month of January had a significant impact on the Tenants. 52. The Landlords were on notice as of October 30, 2017 that the Tenants were experiencing various issues with the dishwasher, fridge and stove. The Landlords decided to replace the dishwasher and fridge instead of repairing them. The new dishwasher and fridge were installed on December 7, 2017. At that time, the Landlords also decided to replace the stove and a new stove was installed on December 14, 2017. 53. The Landlords responded to the Tenants’ complaints regarding the issues with the appliances by ordering new appliances. However, there was no dispute that the Tenants had improperly working appliances for a period of approximately six weeks as no repairs were completed while the appliances were ordered and installed. Therefore, I find that the Landlord was in breach of their maintenance obligations under section 20 of the Act. 54. The Tenants requested an abatement of rent of $500.00 for the six weeks in which the appliances were not working properly and $500.00 for out of pocket expenses related to having no working stove for seven days. The Tenants failed to substantiate their claim for any out of pocket expenses related to not having a working stove. There were no receipts provided to support their claim of purchasing pre-cooked food. 55. I find that an abatement of $500.00 for the six week period in which the Tenants did not have full functioning appliances is appropriate in these circumstances. There were various inconveniences associated with the issues the dishwasher, fridge and stove which would impact the Tenants full use of the rental unit. 56. As stated above the Tenants’ issues with the replacement appliances being inadequate and/or diminished in some capacity is also not relevant under a T6 application, as there was no dispute that the new appliances were operational\",\n",
       " \"I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. L2 Application N8 Notice to End Tenancy 8. Based on the submissions of the parties, I find the Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due. 9. The Tenant requested relief from eviction by requiring the Tenant to pay here lawful rent for the next twelve months on or before the 1st day of every month, starting in March 2018. 10. The Landlords agreed to this on the condition that should the Tenant fail to make any one of said rent payments in full and on time, the Landlords would have the right to seek the Tenant’s eviction, without notice to the Tenant, under section 78 of the Act. The Tenant understood and agreed to this condition, and so this is what will be ordered. N5 Notice to End Tenancy 11. There are two N5 notices of termination underlying the L2 application. The first N5 was served on the Tenant on November 30, 2017, and identified the Landlord’s complaint that the Tenant called the Landlords about an air conditioning issue when the Landlords stated there was no such issue. The second N5 was served on the Tenant on January 11, 2018, this time detailing the Landlord’s complaint of another false issue reported by the Tenant concerning a leak in the basement, and further notified the Tenant about the Tenant’s removal of a door, the CO detector and clutter around the furnace area. 12. The Landlords testified that they believed the first N5 was corrected by the Tenant and therefore voided in the seven-day period. Reference is made to exhibits LL#3 and LL#4 in support of their testimony. 13. RL testified that on December 19, 2017, he received an emergency call from the Tenant that morning about a flood/leak in the rental unit. RL played a video clip he took later that day to show when he came to inspect the unit, and also submitted exhibit LL#5, which comprises text message exchanges between RL and YL dated December 19th and 20th. RL testified that when he arrived, there was no sign of any emergency leak in the basement. 14. YL submitted 6 photographs (exhibits TT#3 to TT#8) that she testified were taken early on December 19th, and which evidence the large amount of water leaking into her sons’ bedroom. YL confirmed she called RL around 5:30 am that morning about the leak. 15. JE testified that she attended the rental unit after 6:00 am on December 19th and witnessed about 1-1/2 inches of water leaking “everywhere” and especially into the sons’ bedroom. JE described how she assisted YL in trying to mop up the water using a series of towels and other implements. JE is married to YL’s ex-spouse, and had arrived to pick up the children. 16. On this particular Landlords’ claim, I find that the evidence and testimonies, especially that of JE, support the Tenant’s version of events over the version claimed by the Landlords. Specifically, I believe that there had been a serious leak of water that occurred in the rental unit in the early hours of December 19, 2017. Based on this, I do not find that the Tenant substantially interfered with the Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment or lawful rights. The Tenant did what a responsible tenant is supposed to do in these circumstances. As such, I am denying this L2 claim, which is the substantive part of the L2 application. 17. The Landlords testified that the Tenant also removed a light dome and laundry room door, dismantled the carbon monoxide detector, had interfered with Landlords entry into the unit by placing “do not enter” signs and had cluttered the area around the furnace with the Tenant’s combustibles. The Landlords submitted exhibits LL#6 to LL#10 in support of their testimony, which include reports from a Brampton Fire Prevention Officer. 18. The Tenant did not dispute the light dome/door issue, the CO detector dismantlement, the “do not enter” signs and the items she stored in shelving units around the furnace. 19. Instead, YL offered explanations that: due to the December 19th incident, she removed the door from its hinges when she dealt with the flood; because both of her boys have ADHD, she removed the tinted dome from the light which bothered them; the CO detector was beeping incessantly and she made the mistake of removing the battery; her 9-year old daughter is the one who placed the “do not enter” signs; the items stored around the furnace are in shelving units (per LL#10) far enough from the furnace. 20. With regard to her sons having ADHD, I read into the record the confirming report of the boys’ psychiatrist to support YL’s testimony. 21. YL stated she is quite willing to re-install the laundry room door on its hinges, and she stated she will ensure the CO detector is never dismantled again and nothing combustible or dangerous is stored close to the furnace going forward. With respect to the light dome and “do not enter” signs, the Landlords were not overly concerned with these. 22. Based on the testimonies and submissions of the parties, I find on a balance of probabilities that the Tenant did substantially interfere with the reasonable enjoyment and lawful rights of the Landlord by dismantling the CO detector. However, from the parties’ respective final arguments and submissions, I further determined that the sought after remedy of eviction is not justified under these circumstances, so long as the Tenant: reinstalls the door on its hinges; removes the “do not enter” signs and ensures the Landlords may enter the unit with proper notice; ensures that the Tenant does not interfere with the CO detector’s operation; and allows for a white dome to be placed over the light (if the Landlords so decide to do). 23. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act\",\n",

L2 Application 5. RN submitted exhibit LL#1, comprising five pages of photographs taken on February 2, 2018, and which show the garage still full of the Tenants’ belongings. This was clearly complained about in the two N5 notices served by the Landlord on the Tenants. In order to remedy the N5 notices, the Tenants must remove their belongings from the garage. 6. The garage is situated adjacent to the house that contains the rental unit (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Garage’). RN affirmed in her testimony that the Tenants have no right to use, or store their things in, the Garage under the tenancy. 7. The Tenants were given a first N5 Notice of Termination under section 67 of the Act on January 5, 2018. Serving a second N5 Notice of Termination on January 13, 2018 was permissible pursuant to Section 68 of the Act. 8. As the Tenants did not remedy the N5 notices within the voiding period provided for under the Act, I find the Tenants’ conduct has substantially interfered with the Landlord's and the other tenants' reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex, and with a lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord. 9. While there were other claims made in the N5 notices, they were not presented by the Landlord during the hearing. As a result, my determination is limited to the finding in paragraph 8 above, with any other claim being denied hereto. 10. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act\",\n",
       " 'Relief from eviction 11. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the RTA and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenant has engaged in a pattern of failing to pay rent and is unwilling to provide the Landlord with post-dated cheques for future rent that comes due and owing. 12. Section 83(3) of the Act requires the Landlord and Tenant Board (LTB) to deny an eviction application if the landlord is in serious breach of the landlord’s obligations under the Act, As discussed below, the Tenant asserts that the Landlord has been doing everything in her power to terminate the tenancy after the Tenant launched complaints against the Landlord, including not addressing repairs ordered by the Board and serving her with multiple notices of termination. I find that the Landlord is not in serious breach of her obligations under the Act. Failure to complete requires repairs 13. The Tenant’s application against the Landlord resulted in an Order CET-68675-17 being issued by the LTB on October 19, 2017 requiring the Landlord and her daughter on or before November 30, 2017 to (a) repair or replace the dryer venting duct system, the kitchen cabinets and the areas of the hardwood floor that are curling; and (b) inspect and complete any necessary repairs/replacements/treatments for carpeting, kitchen faucet, mould/residue in the bathroom, laundry closet door, and address an insect infestation. The Tenant stated that other than repairing the laundry door, Order CET-68675-17 has been ignored by the Landlord and her daughter. 14. With respect to non-compliance with Order CET-68675-17, the Landlord’s evidence was that because the dryer venting system is part of the common area, by virtue of one of the condominium by-laws by which the rental unit owner and occupants are bound, repairs to it have to be done by the condominium association and (or) the manager of the building. However, neither of those entities would accept responsibility. According to the Landlords, both of them are defendants in a Small Claims Court action to sort out responsibility for those repairs by which I took them to mean they are litigating this issue in a court of competent jurisdiction. According to the Landlords, as all of the other repairs and replacements relate to the dryer venting system, only the laundry closet door could be repaired, which was done. 15. By letter dated January 1, 2018, the Tenant wrote to the Landlord’s daughter asking for receipts for all of her rent payments from the beginning of her tenancy; demanding that she be given a rent receipt monthly; requiring interest be paid on her last month’s rent deposit; and asked for repayment of money paid as a key deposit. Although she noted that the picture window in the living room leaks when it rains, there was no mention of non-compliance with Order CET-68675-17 , though one would reasonably expect if the Tenant was questioning the capacity of the Landlord to comply, it would have featured in that demand letter containing complaints regarding other Landlord infractions of the tenancy relationship. 16. It was also stated that on two occasions the Tenant refused to let a representative of the manager of the condominium building and the Landlord inspect her rental unit. The Tenant admitted to having received a text message that someone would be coming to inspect but she claimed she did not get the message regarding what I took to be the exact time they would be there and therefore she was out when they came. 17. Without limiting the Landlord’s obligation to comply with Order CET-68675-17, I am satisfied the Landlord was unable to timely effect the outstanding repairs through no fault of her own and that the laundry closet door was timely repaired. Therefore, I do not find that the Landlord is in serious breach of her maintenance obligations. Service of multiple N12 notices 18. While the Tenant was pursuing her application at the Board, the Landlord served her with an N12 notice of termination for Landlord’s own use with a termination date of September 30, 2017. Subsequently, she was given another N12 calling for her tenancy to terminate on October 1, 2017. These two notices were served prior to the Order CET-68675-17. . 19. The Tenant continued to receive N12 notices for termination of her tenancy. One N12 was for termination effective on October 31, 2017 and then another for termination on January 18, 2018 and yet another was for termination to take effect on March 31, 2018 – in all, a total of three N12s were given to the Tenant after the Order CET-68675-17. In each instance, the stated purpose was that the Landlord requires the residence for her own use. 20. While there is no definition of “harassment” in the RTA, it is generally held that “harassment” is a course of conduct that a reasonable person knows or ought to know would be unwelcome. 21. At the hearing the Tenant relied on the series of N12 notices to show the Landlord was doing all she could to remove her from her rental unit. Although the Landlords did not provide any evidence of their intended personal use of the rental unit neither did the Tenant cross-examine the Landlords regarding the purpose for which the N12 notices were delivered. Although the series of N12 notices would appear to be excessive in that serving so many were probably not necessary, the evidence is insufficient to establish that these notices were improperly served on the Tenant to harass her',\n",

Board Order CEL-68256-17 was issued on August 14, 2017 based on the consent of the parties. At that time rent arrears to August 31, 2017 including the application cost were $9,440.00. 6. Board Order CEL-70342-17 was issued on November 3, 2017 based on the parties’ consent. The arrears to November 30, 2017 were $5,500.00. 7. The Landlord has now filed an application for rent owed from January 1, 2018 to March 31, 2018. 8. I acknowledge the submissions from the Tenants’ Legal Representative that the Tenants’ parents are disabled, elderly and have medical resources close to the rental unit. However the evidence does not demonstrate that the tenancy is sustainable. This is the third application regarding rent owing in the last six months. There have been no payments from the Tenants since the application was filed on January 4, 2018 and the amount owing is substantial ($5,550)\",\n",
       " \"No circumstances were disclosed in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act to consider relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. Costs 16. The Landlord's Legal Representative requests costs for attendance at the March 7, 2018 hearing because the Tenant has failed to comply with the Board’s interim order and failed to disclose issues pursuant to section 82 which was part of the reason the first adjournment request was granted. The Landlord's Legal Representative submitted that the amount of costs should be assessed based on my determinations. 17. According to the Board’s Interpretation Guideline 3, costs may generally be ordered where a party’s conduct in the proceeding was unreasonable. Generally, only fees related to time spent at the hearing by a party’s legal representative will be allowed. 18. The Tenant’s conduct is unreasonable. His conduct caused unnecessary delay in this proceeding because he failed to comply with the Board’s interim order regarding payment of rent and attendance at the June 15th hearing when it was made clear to the Tenant that attendance on June 15th was peremptory. 19. The Landlord's Legal Representative was in attendance for approximately two hours at the last hearing and approximately 15 minutes at the hearing on June 15, 2018. Under these circumstances it is appropriate to order costs of $100 for the legal costs and unnecessary attendance at the June 15th hearing\",\n",
       " 'Relief from eviction 19. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act and find that it would not be necessary to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act because the Tenant said he could pay outstanding arrears very quickly. Regarding L2 damage application 20. On January 2, 2018, the Tenant was given a first N5 Notice of Termination under section 62 of the Act. This N5 notice did not become void because the Tenant did not correct the problem within the 7 day time period set out in the notice. 21. The issue to be determined is whether the Tenant or a person whom the tenant permitted in the residential complex wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit. 22. The Landlord testified that that cleaning company hired by the Tenant increased the temperature of the hot water tank causing the pipe to burst and flooding the basement. He said he had to completely replace the laminate flooring in the unit. The Landlord submitted a letter from Reliance home comfort in support of his testimony and receipts for the repair of the flooring. 23. Section 62 of the Act holds a tenant or person whom the tenant permits in the residential complex responsible for wilful or negligent undue damage to the rental unit or residential complex. 24. Conduct is negligent if there is a risk of damage which a reasonable person would take reasonable precautions against (Bolton v. Stone 1951 A.C. 850). There is not an expectation that all possible risks will be avoided, but that reasonable precautions will be taken to protect against reasonably foreseeable risks. If a person reasonably, albeit mistakenly, believes that there is no risk then the conduct is not negligent (Beutler v. Beutler 1983 O.J. No. 505 at para. 148). 25. The Landlord has not provided sufficient evidence to support a finding of wilful or negligent undue damage. It is evident that the basement flooring sustained undue damage. However, the evidence does not demonstrate that the flood was a result of wilful or negligent conduct of the Tenant or a person permitted in the unit by the Tenant. 26. The report from Reliance states “relit pilot and added 2 holes at the bottom of the tank to allow water to drain out of pan. Advised customer if manually opened that is on them tampering with tank; replaced TP valve”. 27. The Tenant testified that the Reliance technician told him that if he tampered with the tank, he would be responsible. 28. This is consistent with the content of the Reliance report. In any event, the report does not state that the Tenant or someone in the unit tampered with the hot water tank such that the tank flooded the basement. The report does not state the reason for the replacement of the TP valve and the technical did not attend the hearing to provide evidence',\n",
       " \"Also a 90 day written notice of the increase must be given to the Tenants or the increase is void under section 116 of the Act. 11. Therefore, the utilities are not rent and the full $1,000.00 paid for February rent by OW is credited to the rent arrears owing under this order. 12. There is no dispute that there is a balance of $500.00 owing for the February 2018 rent. 13. There is also no dispute that the full March rent of $1,500.00 is owing. However, the Tenants are planning on moving out of the rental unit on March 31st and the last month's rent deposit will cover the March rent. 14. The only dispute regarding the amount of rent owing relates to the January rent. OW paid $1,000.00 towards the January rent. The Landlord alleges that the Tenants did not pay the $500.00 balance. 15. The Tenants allege that they paid the $500.00 balance for January rent in cash to the Landlord’s son. They have no rent receipt for the payment. They claim that the Landlord’s son refused to give them a receipt. 16. The Tenants provided bank records which show a withdrawal of $465.00 on December 19, 2017. They claim this withdrawal together with $35.00 cash they had on hand was paid to the Landlord’s son in December 2017 in advance for the January 2018 rent. 17. The Landlord’s son stated that he did not give a receipt for the January rent because the $500.00 payment was never made. He produced his receipt book at the hearing which showed that receipts have been given for other cash payments the Tenants made. 18. The Landlord’s son also provided a copy of text message from the female Tenant which acknowledges that $500.00 is owing. 19. The bank withdrawal of $465.00 in December 2017 does not establish that the Landlord actually received $500.00 for the January rent. 20. Cash payments are very difficult to establish without a receipt or other documentation. Simply stating that the rent was paid is insufficient to establish that the payment was made. 21. Based on the evidence presented, I am not satisfied that $500.00 was paid towards the January rent. 22. The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,500.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord. 23. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from July 31, 2017 to January 16, 2018 (the termination date in the N4 notice). 24. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until March 31, 2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. The Tenants have plans to move out on this date. The Landlord was not unduly opposed to this date since there is a last month's rent deposit to apply to the March rent\",\n",
       " \"I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. L2 application Damage 7. The Landlord claimed in his application that the Tenant caused damage to the rental unit. However during the hearing the Landlord did not address any of the claimed damages claimed, therefore I cannot make an award for damages. Substantial interference 8. The Landlord claimed the Tenant substantially interfered with his reasonable enjoyment because if his child ran upstairs, the Tenant would make noise complaints and bang on the roof. One such incident occurred on December 15, 2017, after a heavy snowstorm. The Landlord turned on the vacuum cleaner and the Tenant came upstairs banging on the door shouting and yelling about the noise from the vacuum. 9. The Landlord also stated the Tenant smoked marijuana in the rental unit and this affected the Landlord’s 2 year old child. 10. The Landlord also stated that the Tenant and her guest made racial slurs at the Landlord on an unspecified date. 11. The Tenant’s response was that the Landlords child would run during the day from 9:00 am to 12:00 am, after she had been told when she moved in that the child would not be home during the day. The Tenant stated she works at night, and due to her health concerns after an accident, she cannot go out in public during the daytime. In response to the vacuuming incident in December 16, 2017, the Tenant stated she had worked a shift from 3:00 am to 11:00 am and was awoken by a boom sound above her, so she went upstairs and asked the Landlord to keep it down. 12. The Tenant denied smoking marijuana in the rental unit and stated she used marijuana (TSL oils for dietary purposes) in her cooking for medical reasons. The Tenant stated she is on other medications as well. The Tenant further stated she communicated with the Landlord’s wife on November 9 and she arranged to cook using marijuana elsewhere. 13. The Tenant denied making racial slurs to the Landlord, and asserted that she is not hostile when talking with the Landlord. The Tenant also responded that her Dad, when visiting would get notes put on his parked car by the Landlord’s neighbour’s and that cause her Dad to curse at the neighbours, to leave his car alone. 14. I find that on a balance of probabilities the Tenant’s behaviour does not constitute substantial interference with Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment. Both parties experience some noise caused by the other. The Landlord lives in the upper level and the Tenant lives in a basement of the house and some noise is to be expected because the property was not likely constructed with such usage in mind. 15. With respect to the marijuana use, I find that on a balance of probabilities the Tenant used it for cooking purposes. 16. With respect to the allegation of racial slurs, on a balance of probabilities, I find the Tenant did not make racial slurs to the Landlord. Serious impairment of safety 17. The Landlord testified that on November 18, 2018 the Tenant was using the oven as a heater in the rental unit, and this was a fire hazard. The Landlord further stated that he found that the fire detector had been disabled during a fire inspection on January 14, 2018. 18. The Tenant responded stating there was no independent heating in the basement unit and the centralized heating for the house comes into the basement unit. The Tenant stated that the left side electrical panel was blown by the microwave (as she informed the Landlord’s electrician) so she was unable use a separate space heater .The Tenant stated she leaves the stove on while she is awake. The Tenant let the fire inspector know when he came on January 9, 2018 that she was using the stove as a heater, and he responded that if there was no independent heating source he didn’t know what to tell her. 19. The Tenant also stated the fire detector fell off on its own and she and the fire inspector watched it fall on January 9, 2018. 18. While Tenant left her stove on for heating purposes due to the lack of sufficient heat in the basement, I am satisfied that this only occurred she was awake and had informed the fire inspector. I also find that on a balance of probabilities that the fire detector was defective there was no evidence submitted of any actual serious impairment of safety. 19. I therefore find that the Landlord has not established that the Tenant has seriously impaired the safety of the Landlord or other persons in the residential complex. 20. The Landlord is directed to fix the electrical panel on or before March 4, 2018, and once the electrical panel is fixed the Tenant is not to use the oven as a heating source\",\n",

The Tenants have resided in the rental unit since 2015. They have four children. The rent arrears accumulated because both Tenants lost time off work over the past year due to health issues. Both Tenants are back at work full time and now have sufficient income to cover the ongoing rent and the arrears payments. 22. The Landlord is concerned that the Tenants cannot afford the rent and utilities for the rental unit and believes she will not get the proposed payments. The prejudice to the Landlord is minimized because she can request to end the tenancy if the payments ordered below are not paid in full or on time. 23. The payments ordered below were discussed at the hearing. The Tenants were made aware of their obligation to begin the payments as of June 22nd even if they have not received this order in the mail by that date',\n",

While there is no definition of “harassment” in the RTA, it is generally held that “harassment” is a course of conduct that a reasonable person knows or ought to know would be unwelcome. 30. The Tenant’s text messages to the Landlord were critical of the Landlord’s delay in responding to him and there was an occasion on December 28, 2017 on the telephone when the conversation became heated resulting in the landlord hanging up on the Tenant. The Landlord wanted it understood that delays in responding to the Tenant’s text messages were due to him having gone to Florida from January 3, 2018 to January 6th and from there he went on to Jamaica where, he said, internet service was poor and expensive. He returned to Ontario on January 18, 2018.I note, however, the delays that the Tenant complained about in his text messages occurred before the Landlord left Canada. 31. I find the gist of the Landlord’s behaviour that the Tenant has complained about is essentially grounded on the Landlord’s lack of professionalism, by which I took the Tenant to mean his unreasonableness. That behaviour is so entwined in the failure to provide adequate heat that granting relief for harassment, I find, would amount to double recovery which I am not prepared to award. 32. In addition, I am not satisfied the communications or lack thereof on the part of the Landlord rise to the level of constituting harassment or any of the other forms of inappropriate conduct listed in the T2 application. At the hearing which took place on the morning of March 1, 2018, the Tenant returned the keys to the rental unit to the Landlord. The Landlord requested to terminate the tenancy in his L1 application. The tenancy is terminated as of February 28, 2018\",\n",

Although I acknowledge that this is a long term tenancy, the rent arrears owing are substantial and by the Tenant’s own admission no rent payments have been made since 2016. It would be unfair to delay or deny the eviction. The Tenant has already received the benefit of as delay as a result of his review request and no rent has been paid to the Landlord for that period or the current month\",\n",
       " 'In accordance with section 48 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), in order for the Landlord to be able to terminate the tenancy he must demonstrate that in good faith he requires possession of the unit for the purpose of residential occupation for at least one year.

The property that houses the rental unit is a semi-detached back split containing three occupied units. The rental unit consists of 600 square feet in which there is a tiny kitchen and a small bathroom. 3. The tenant took occupancy of the rental unit in or about the beginning of December 2016. Credibility of the Parties 4. The Landlord said about two to three months ago he had to sell a residential property he owned at “L” Street in Brampton because he could not afford it. He said he is renting a room in that house and that he pays rent by contributing about $500 per month on account of utilities. 5. Pressed to explain the circumstances by which he is able to pay a portion of the utilities as his rent, the Landlord stated that his son owns the Leacrest property. The Landlord acknowledged his wife lives at “L”, too, as does his brother. 6. The Landlord was shown a rental listing for “L” dated April 12, 2018 indicating he is the owner of that property. The Landlord claimed he has a deed showing he transferred it to his son. Contrary to his earlier testimony, the Landlord stated he gave “L” to his son as a gift. He said he will instruct his lawyer to register the deed immediately. 7. Presented with a Teranet real estate search for Peel region dated April 11, 2018, under cross-examination and contrary to his earlier testimony, the Landlord was forced to admit that he owns three residential properties he had not declared in earlier testimony. 8. The Landlord also said he was not getting along well with his wife but that his plan is for them to live at the rental unit because it is near his son’s residence. 9. The failure of the Landlord to be forthcoming about the number of properties he owns is a good indication he is not being truthful about his financial circumstances. Despite claiming he prefers to live frugally, I find that the Landlord attempted to create a false impression of his financial circumstances in order to try to make his claim that he would want to live in a 600 square foot unit appear reasonable. Further, it seems unlikely that both the Landlord and his spouse would live in such a small living space given the other residential properties at their disposal. Also, the Landlord did not convince me that he in fact intends to live apart from his wife at the rental unit 10. Accordingly, I am not satisfied that the Landlord has demonstrated he is acting in good faith in requiring possession of the rental unit for the purpose of his residential occupation. N8 Tenant persistently Paid Rent Late 11. The Landlord’s evidence is that he served the N8 notice of termination on December 29, 2017 by leaving it where the Tenant’s mail is normally delivered. The N8 notice, which alleges that the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the rent, has a termination date of February 28, 2018. 12. The Tenant denies having been served on that date with the N8 notice. She said it was about two weeks ago she received the notice. The Tenant submits serving the N8 on December 29, 2017 is highly suspicious because that is the same day the Landlord filed an L2 application at the Board. 13. I recognize the Tenant is not suggesting she was prejudiced by having had the N8 come to her attention at a later date but, instead, is asserting the affidavit of service is untrue and therefore is a good indication the Landlord is not accurate and credible, generally. However, I am not persuaded the affidavit of service indicating the N4 and N8 notices were left where the Tenant’s mail is normally delivered is untrue as no reason was suggested as to why the Landlord would have benefited by affecting service later than December 29, 2017. 14. The details listed on the N8 with respect to persistent late payment of rent are somewhat inaccurate or incomplete when compared to the receipts for cash payments from the Tenant. However, they are not so incorrect as to not satisfy the requirements of subsection 43(2) of the RTA. 15. The receipts show in many cases rent was not paid on the first of the month, which is when rent is due. A number of the rent receipts are signed by the Tenant. The Tenant said she did not pay attention to the dates on them. Since receipts are generally provided for the benefit of the payor and in this case there being no reason to suggest otherwise, I am satisfied the contents of the rent receipts are accurate, including the dates on them indicating when money was paid. 16. The receipts for the last three months are dated February 4, 2018, March 16, 2018 and April 11, 2018. In the approximately 15 months the Tenant has been renting from the Landlord these are the most egregious of the late payments. The Tenant said one of those late payments was due to her having used rent money for gas for her car. Another was because she was waiting on a tax refund and there was an occasion when she could not locate the Landlord so she deposited the cash back into her bank account. 17. The Tenant said frequently the Landlord did not come to her door on the first day of the month to collect rent. The Landlord however said he always went to her door on the first day of the month but there were times when she would not be there or she would ask him to come back on another date to be paid the rent. 18. The Landlord did not object in writing to the timing of the payments of rent from the Tenant until an earlier N8 notice was issued. A previous application for eviction based on that N8 was dismissed in order CEL-72400-17-RV issued on March 12, 2018. 19. The Tenant pays her rent in cash and objected to the suggestion she pay rent by post-dated cheques or electronic transfers from her bank account without offering an explanation. The Landlord stated that the Tenant should have to come to him to pay rent but he did not offer how that would be accomplished. 20. The Landlord acknowledges that currently there are no arrears of rent owed. 21. Having considered the evidence set out below, I find that the Tenant has persistently paid the rent late. The reasons offered by the Tenant for the most egregious failures to pay on time, I find, are not valid. With respect to the shorter delays in payments of rent, in the absence of any explanation why the Landlord would not attend on the first of the month when rent is due, I find there is no credible reason why the payments were not made by the Tenant on time. 22. As stated, under section 83(2) of the RTA, the Board may refuse to grant an order evicting the tenant unless satisfied, having regard to all of the circumstances, that it would be unfair to refuse, or, the Board may order that enforcement of the eviction be postponed for a period of time. The Landlord’s resort to falsehood coupled with the fact that the Landlord has been paid all of the rent that was due in the 15 months during which this tenancy has existed, leads me to find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction, subject to the following conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and204(1)of theRTA',\n",

This application was filed on March 25, 2018, the Tenant has already had approximately thirty days to find alternate accommodations, therefore I am satisfied that a delay just until the end of the month would not be unfair in these circumstances and is reasonable.

L2 Application 6. The Landlord served the Tenants with an N7 notice effectively on April 12, 2018. The notice clearly identifies that the Landlord is seeking the immediate termination of the tenancy because of complaints of the Tenants fighting, screaming, smoking, drug usage and making undue noise on February 15, 2018, March 22, 2018 and April 5 & 12, 2018, as well as complaints from the next door neighbour that a Tenants’ friend broke into their garage and car, and stole items from them. 7. The L2 application claims wilful damage in the amount of $355.00 in respect of undue damage to the front door and ceiling above it, and a window screen. 8. The N7 notice specified a termination date of April 24, 2018, which represents 10 days of time, and satisfies the notice requirements of subsections 63(1) and 66(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). 9. BG explained that the rental unit is one of three basement units, while the main floor unit is rented by the Landlord on an AirBnB basis. 10. It became evident from the Landlord’s submissions that the claim of “inconsistent with use as a residential premises” would not be substantiated or proven on a balance of probabilities. I indicated I would deny this claim, and the Landlord acquiesced on this point. 11. NF provided her testimony on all the claims. To corroborate NF’s testimony, BG submitted the following exhibits: • LL#1 and LL#4: a copy a text message from a “R” who was to rent the main floor unit that on April 12, 2018, the Tenants and their friends were banging on the door below at 11:00 pm and that they “were wasted on drugs”; • LL#2: a copy of a May 31, 2018 letter from another basement tenant, to confirm the Tenants’ friend was causing undue banging noises on April 4, 2018 late at night and on April 5, 2018 early in the morning, when the friend brought many garbage bags and boxes stuffed with “random” items; • LL#3, a copy of a May 31, 2018 letter written by the next door neighbour who affirms that on April 5, 2018, one of the Tenants’ friends broke into their garage, broke into their car and stole various items. The Tenants’ friend was apprehended by the police and the neighbour’s items were stored at the side of the rental unit. • LL#5 – photos taken in March to May 2018 to evidence the undue damage caused to the rental unit door and ceiling above it, and the window screen; and • LL#6 – a copy of an estimate to repair the undue damage, for $355.00 plus HST. 12. NF was unable to provide any testimony or other evidence as to how the Tenants or their permitted guests seriously impaired the safety of another person in the rental unit or in the residential building. 13. With respect to the damage to the rental unit door (a hole) and the ceiling (a hole), NF speculated that the Tenants either punched or kicked the door and ceiling, or were carrying an object which they would have used to hit the door and ceiling. When I asked further, NF had no first-hand knowledge or any second-person account as to how the door and ceiling were damaged, or by whom. Based on this, I was unable to determine on a balance of probabilities that first, the Tenants or their permitted guests caused the damage, and second, whether the damage was caused through negligence or by wilful behaviour. As such, I indicated the Landlord failed to persuade me on this particular claim of undue damage. 14. However, with regard to the window screen, NF’s testimony and photographs were sufficient to persuade me that the Tenants or their permitted guests wilfully damaged the screen. Specifically, the Tenants ran an extension cord/cable from the rental unit out through the screened window, so that they could recharge the battery to their e-scooter. In this case, I believe that on a balance of probabilities, the Tenants wilfully cut through the screen to allow a cable to pass through it. For this claim, I will grant the Landlord the $50.00 plus HST she is seeking for the repair of the screen, as quoted in LL#6, which I find to be a reasonable repair amount. 15. In summary, there was no evidence or testimony provided by the Landlord to support the Landlord’s claim that any serious impairment to someone’s safety had occurred or that any wilful damage had been done by the Tenants or their permitted guests. While a friend of the Tenants was caught for theft by the police, the act of his theft did not impair anyone’s safety which is the threshold to be reached under this application. 16. Pursuant to subsection 66(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’): “A landlord may give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy if, (a) an act or omission of the tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the tenant seriously impairs or has seriously impaired the safety of any person; and (b) the act or omission occurs in the residential complex.” 17. I am not satisfied that the Tenants’ actions would support a finding that they have seriously impaired the safety of another person. 18. Subsection 66(1) of the Act does not state that any possibility or risk of harm or impairment of safety is sufficient to justify termination. Rather the subsection uses the qualifier “serious”. Given that the Tenants’ noise and even smoking habits may have interfered with the tenants upstairs or in the basement unit, I find that the claims in of themselves are not sufficient to meet the test of “serious impairment of safety”. As a result, this portion of the Landlord’s application shall be dismissed. 19. The Landlord provided no testimony or evidence to support the claim of wilful damage in the application, other than for the window screen which I am granting the Landlord. However, I will not order non-remedial eviction for this discrete damage. 20. Finally, the Landlord provided no testimony or evidence to support the claim of inconsistent use in the application, and this third portion of the application is dismissed. 21. I made these determinations orally at the hearing to those present\",\n",

I gave my determination regarding the August 31, 2018 termination date to the parties present. From that, the parties were able to reach a mutual agreement about how the rent arrears and filing fee are to be paid back to the Landlord. Specifically, the parties agreed that the total amount owing would be paid in $100.00 increments on the 22nd day of each month starting on September 22, 2018 until the total amount owing is paid off. If the Tenants miss any one of the monthly payments, then the total balance owing at that point of the missed payment would be due to the Landlords in full. Finally, they agreed that the last month’s rent deposit that the Landlord is holding will be applied against the rent due for August 2018. L2 Application 11. Before me, the parties requested an order on consent to resolve the L2 application for the remainder of the tenancy. Specifically, the Tenants agreed not to smoke, neither in the rental unit nor on the rental unit property for the duration of the tenancy, subject to a section 78 provision under the Act. T2 Application 12. The Tenants requested a withdrawal of their T2 application. Pursuant to subsection 200(4) of the Act, I consented to the withdrawal of the application\",\n",

The Tenants did not attend the hearing that took place on June 20, 2018. 2. The Tenant who filed the review request states that he was not reasonably able to participate in the hearing because he was “out of town on company business”. 3. The Board mailed two copies of the Notice of Hearing, one for each Tenant, on June 4, 2018. 4. Pursuant to subsection 191(3) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, (the ‘Act’) the Notice is deemed to have been given 5 days after mailing. 5.

There is no mention of the second Tenant in the review request or why they could not attend the hearing if the other Tenant was out of town on business. 6. On the basis of the limited submissions made in the request, I am not satisfied that the Tenants were not reasonably able to participate in the hearing. 7. If the Tenants want to preserve their tenancy they may be able to make use of the options set out in paragraph 8 or 9 of the order if they pay the amount required to void the order. 8.

       " 'L2 Application 9. The affidavit of AOR was submitted by the Landlords in accordance with the requirements of subsection 72(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). 10. AOR is the son of the Landlords. With a letter of offer in support (exhibit LL#2), AOR testified that in September 2018, he shall be attending university in Hamilton. AOR testified he intends to live in the rental unit for at least one year, and if successful with his engineering studies, will most probably live in the unit for the balance of his undergraduate years. 11. In cross-examination, AOR admitted he did not bring evidence of an “acceptance letter” by him, but reaffirmed under oath that he has accepted to go to university in Hamilton starting in September 2018. 12. AOR and SSP confirmed by their respective testimonies that they moved from Kuwait to Canada in July 2018 and are currently living in a Mississauga apartment. SSP stated that her three other children are to arrive in late August before the start of the new school year. SSP stated it was important to move into the unit ahead of time, so that she can properly set up her family for the new school year in the rental unit. 13. The Landlords submitted exhibit LL#3, which is a December 8, 2017 email to the Tenant, informing the Tenant of the Landlords’ intention to move into the unit. While LL#3 did not constitute proper notice, the Landlords indicated the Tenant has known of the Landlords’ intentions for a sufficiently long time. 14. The Tenant claimed there is a lack of “good faith” in the Landlords’ application. First, the Tenant argued that due to the Landlords failing to institute an increase in monthly rent, the Landlords decided to serve an N12 notice. Second, the Tenant argued the school year period in Kuwait is the same as in Canada, that is from September to June, and so the Landlords wanting to move into the unit in the winter of 2018 (LL#3) flies in the face of the SPP’s testimony that she wants to set up for school in September. 15. The Landlords submitted that the academic year in Kuwait begins in April and ends in March, so their initial emailed notice (LL#3) is in line with the Kuwaiti academic year. 16. The Tenant testified that his wife went to India on May 30, 2018 for her mother’s medical condition and impending surgery and is currently scheduled to return at the end of August. If the Landlords are successful with their L2 application, he requested a termination date of mid-September 2018, so that he can coordinate a move-out with his wife being present. 17. The Landlords confirmed that the unpaid rent for July 2018 is hereby waived in respect of the compensation they are required to pay. As well if the Landlords are successful with their application, they indicated they would apply the last month’s rent deposit to the last rental period ordered. Analysis and Determinations: 18. With regard to the L2 application, I was sufficiently persuaded by the Landlords that their son, AOR, genuinely intends to move into the rental unit for at least one year, along with SSP and then his remaining siblings. 19. I also find that the Landlords have paid the Tenant the required compensation pursuant to subsections 48.1 and 55.1 of the Act. 20. The testimonies and submissions concerning the failed attempt to raise rent illegally were, on a balance of probabilities, a separate set of communications and circumstances. It is evident that the December 8, 2017 email well predates any indication of a requested rent increase, and this strongly suggests to me that the later failed attempt has no real connection to the Landlords’ earlier stated intention to move into the unit. 21. I gave the aforementioned determination to the parties present and having considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, I find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until August 31, 2018, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. 22. With regard to the L9 application, it is clear that after the waiving of July 2018 rent, the balance is zero. However, the issue of the $190.00 filing fee still needs to be determined. 23. It is the normal practice of the Board to award a landlord its cost of filing an application in any instance when the Landlord is successful with its application. The reason for this is found in the relevant statutory provisions combined with the Board’s Rules of Practice and Interpretation Guidelines. 24. Specifically, I refer to sub-sections 204(2) and 74(2) of the Act, as well as to Board’s Guideline No. 3 entitled “Costs”, and Rule 27.1 of the Board’s Rules of Practice. 25. However, Members do have the limited discretion granted under subsections 204(1) and 204(2) of the Act to order that the cost of filing an application not be paid. 26. In this particular case, I believe again that the conflicting testimonies about the failed attempt to raise rent, and the Landlords’ subsequent refusal to accept the then lawful rent, place me into a grey area where the limited discretion that Members have, may be exercised for this case. 27. Given all of the testimonies and evidence before me, I can easily find that the Landlords unilaterally refused to accept $1,600.00 from the Tenant on April 29, 2018 in respect of rent that became due on May 1, 2018. While the parties provided conflicting testimonies about past due rents, TT#3 provides the only documented evidence of two-way communication between the parties surrounding the “rent arrears” around the time of L9 filing. In my view, I find it more likely than not that the Landlords did not accept the Tenant’s May and June rent payments, which then was followed by the Landlords filing their L9 application on June 22, 2018. Simply put, how can the Tenant be considered in arrears if the Landlords refused to accept lawful rent payments from the Tenant? 28. Based on all this, I am unable to find that the Tenant was clearly in arrears at the time of L9 filing, and therefore I am electing to use my discretion under subsections 204(1) and 204(2) to deny the cost of the application in favour of the Landlords',\n",

The Landlord complied with Order CET-74655-18 and CEL-75019-18 by paying to the Tenants the $8,860.00 rent abatement on June 29, 2018. Unbelievably, the Tenants did not apply any portion of the payment towards the arrears. The Tenant’s son stated that they put the money aside to make sure they comply with the Order to pay rent on the first of the month from July 2018 to June 2019. 7. The Tenant’s son gave evidence that his parents are self-employed but are currently sick and suffering from depression. He has a sister who works and helps to pay the rent along with him and there are two other siblings who attend university. The arrears of rent started in March 2018 after his sister had surgery and his parents fell ill. Section 82 At the hearing the Tenants raised a number of maintenance issues pursuant to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). Several of the maintenance issues the Tenants attempted to raise have already been addressed in Order CET-74655-18/CEL-75019-18 issued on May 30, 2018. That Order awarded the Tenants a rent abatement of $8,860.00 and directs the Landlord to complete detailed repairs on or before September 30, 2018. The principle of re judicata means that once the Board as issued a final order about a specific maintenance issue, a party cannot ask the Board to issue another order for that same issue. For this reason, the complaints about the front porch steps and mold are not considered in this order. The Tenant’s son gave evidence that the air conditioning was not working and the technician sent by the Landlord identified a carbon monoxide leak during an inspection. He notified the Tenants about the leak but did not shut off the furnace. The Tenants, alarmed by a possible carbon monoxide leak, contacted a heating/cooling company who reported on July 13, 2018 that the furnace had a crack; there was carbon monoxide spillage and the furnace and air conditioning needed replacement. The Tenants forwarded a copy of the report to the Landlord on July 16, 2018. The Tenants also contacted Enbridge who identified a potential safety issue and shut off the furnace on July 18, 2018. Enbridge instructed the Landlord to correct the problem within 35 days. According to the Tenants, the furnace was replaced by the Landlord on July 25, 2018. The Landlords denied there was a carbon monoxide leak based on the report of his technician who installed a carbon monoxide detector on July 16, 2018. There was some back and forth argument between the parties on whether or not the furnace was a rental. That argument is irrelevant to my determination that there was a problem with both the air conditioning and the furnace. However, I am satisfied that the Landlord acted within a reasonable time to rectify the problem by having the furnace replaced within 12 days of been notified. As a result, there will be no abatement of rent awarded the Tenants. The Tenant’s son stated that they were forced to stay home from work on five different dates to let the Landlord’s contractors into the rental unit to carry out repairs but the contractors did not always show up and the Tenants lost wages from missing work on those days. The days mentioned by the Tenant’s son are July 16, 18, 25 and 27 2018. The complaints of the Tenants regarding missing work are frivolous and appear to be an effort to either distract from the nonpayment of rent issue or are being made in hopes of getting a rent abatement. The evidence before the Board is that the Tenants do not currently work and even if they did, they are not obliged to be home when served with a notice of entry. The testimony of the parties and the text messages tendered as exhibits establish that on July 16 and 18, 2018 the Landlord’s technician and Enbridge visited to install the carbon monoxide detector and inspect the furnace on an emergency basis and the Tenants were home at the time. On July 27, 2018, the Tenants failed to confirm an appointment and the technicians did not show up as a result. The Tenants email to the Landlord on July 22, 2018 informing the Landlord that all repairs must be suspended until after the hearing of this application is unreasonable given the fact that the Landlord must meet the deadline of September 30, 2018 for completion of all ordered repairs. The Tenant’s son complained that on July 25, 2018, the Landlord droped off a dishwasher to be installed at a future date. Emails exchanges between the parties show that on that date the Landlord’s technicians installed a new fireplace, dehumidifier and air conditioning\",\n",
       " \"I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. RPE testified that her husband no longer lives in the home but she is able to keep up with the payment of the rent because she has two jobs now. She requested to be given two months to pay off the arrears. I have some concern about the Tenants’ ability to keep up with the payment of the rent at $3,200.00 monthly. However, the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (‘Act’) is intended to be remedial in nature and the payment plan is not onerous on the Landlord. Therefore, the Tenants will be given a chance to pay off all that they owe in two months. Section 82 At the hearing the Tenants raised a number of maintenance issues pursuant to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). RPE gave evidence that the backyard was like a forest overgrown with weeds and was so unkempt that a neighbor called the city of Caledon about three weeks ago to lodge a complaint. The city issued a work order against the Landlord. The swimming pool in the backyard was taken over by snakes and frogs and looked like a swamp. The landlord gave evidence that at the start of the tenancy, the Tenants signed an addendum to the lease agreement which stated that the care and maintenance of the pool will be undertaken by the Tenants. There is a city bylaw that the pool must be opened every summer and the Tenants failure to do so prompted a report to the city. The Landlords confirmed that they were ordered by the city to clean the pool and maintain the backyard by August 8, 2018 after which the city will return for another inspection. The pool was cleaned at the Landlord’s expense a day prior to the hearing. Section 20 (1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 provides that a Landlord is responsible for providing and maintaining a residential complex, including the rental units in it, in a good state of repair and fit for habitation and for complying with health, safety, housing and maintenance standards. Section 4 of the Act states that any provision in a tenancy agreement that is inconsistent with the Act is void. Therefore, despite the tenancy agreement purporting to make the Tenants responsible for the maintenance of the pool, I find that obligation lies with the Landlords who have failed to maintain the residential complex in a good state of repair. RPE further gave evidence that the deck is falling apart. While the Landlord hired a contractor in April 2018 who placed two planks in specific spots to repair it, there are still areas of the deck requiring repairs and this prevents them from going out on the deck. The Landlords disagreed with the Tenants that the deck is unsafe and provided a video of the male Landlord walking around on the deck. The Landlord however, did not dispute the Tenant’s testimony that there are two specific areas outside the scope of the video that need repairs. The Landlord corroborated the Tenant’s evidence when she provided an email from a deck contractor stating that it will cost $300.00 to fix the new hole on the deck. The Tenant is not seeking rent abatement for the poor state of the swimming pool. However, they will be awarded a rent abatement for the lack of proper maintenance of the deck from June 2018 when the Tenants started complaining about the state of the deck until August 2018. This amount will be 5% of the monthly rent of $3,200.00 for three months totaling $480.00 and will be deducted from the total arrears owed by the Tenants. The Landlords will also be ordered to perform the needed repairs to the deck. Furthermore, the backyard although unkempt with weeds and overgrown bushes, did not prompt a complaint from the Tenants to the Landlords. The Landlords were forced to maintain it after the city of Caledon intervened due to a call from a neighbor. The Landlord will be ordered to maintain the grounds of the rental unit. Laundry The Tenants gave evidence that in April 2018 when they moved into the rental unit, the washer and dryer smelled very bad. The Tenant informed the Landlord of the smell. The Tenants then proceeded to make a rent-to-own arrangement for a new washer and dryer with monthly payments of $200.00. The Landlords stated that at the time the last Tenant moved out, they hired someone to clean the rental unit including the washer and dryer. The female Landlord further stated that the Tenant informed her she would replace the washer and dryer and did not give her an option to clean or replace it herself. As the payments being made by the Tenants gives them the option of one day owning the washer and dryer, I believe that they entered into the agreement for that purpose. Further, the Tenants did not ask the Landlord to have the old laundry equipment cleaned before entering into this arrangement. Finding that the Landlords are responsible for the Tenants’ $200.00 monthly payments would be absurd in the circumstances\",\n",
       " 'Having considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, I find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until August 31, 2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act',\n",
       " \"With the additional days added for mailing, the termination date in the N4 notice is not at least 14 days after it was deemed received. 6. Since the N4 notice is not valid, there is no jurisdiction to terminate the tenancy under the L1 application. The Landlord requested an order for the rent arrears owing. 7. There is no dispute that the Tenant owes $2,350.00 to the Landlord up to August 31, 2018. The Tenant was having financial difficulties earlier this year and wanted to use the last month's rent deposit to cover the rent he did not pay in March/April 2018. 8. The Tenant was not aware that subsection 106(10) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, (the ‘Act’) states that the last month's rent deposit must be applied to the last month of the tenancy. Now that he is aware of that, he stated that he can pay the amount owing by September 10, 2018. 9. The Landlords collected a rent deposit of $2,350.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlords. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 19, 2017. Persistent Late Payment of Rent 10. The Tenant initially stated that he did not receive the N8 Notice of Termination. The Landlords provided proof it was sent by registered mail and signed for when received by the Tenant. Therefore, I am satisfied that the Tenant received the N8 notice. 11. The Tenant has persistently paid the rent late. The rent is due on the first day of each month. The rent was paid late every month from October 2017 to May 2018. 12. The Tenant stated that he had a high paying job in the United States which he lost last year and this led to financial difficulties from December 2017 through to May of this year. 13. The rent for June, July and August 2018 were all paid on time. This is not disputed. The Tenant now has a new full-time job and stated that he can pay the rent on time from now on. 14. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. The Tenant is ordered to pay the rent on time for a one year period. If the rent is not paid on time as ordered below, the Landlords can request to terminate the tenancy under the provisions of section 78 of the Act. Lock Change 15. There is no dispute that the Tenant changed the lock on the door giving entry to the rental unit without the Landlords’ consent. 16. The Tenant and his wife have five children. To make it easier for his kids to access the unit, the Tenant changed the key lock to a new modern lock which has a key pad so the door can be unlocked by pressing a number code instead of using a key. However, this lock can also be opened by a standard key if needed. 17. The Tenant gave the Landlords a copy of the key to the new lock at the hearing. 18. However, the Landlords would like the lock changed back to the original lock that was on the door when the Tenant moved in. 19. The unit is a townhouse located in a condominium complex. The Landlords stated that the condominium corporation requires that the same lock be used on all entrance doors and the key pad lock is not permissible. The Tenant requested proof of this but the Landlords were not able to provide any evidence of this. 20. A picture was provided of the new lock. It is the same colour as the old lock, matches the door handle and is not unsightly in any way. 21. In any event, the Landlord provided insufficient evidence to support the amount claimed to change the lock back to a lock similar to the one that used to be on the door. They had no receipts or invoices to support the amount claimed. 22. Subsection 35(3) of the Act states that the Board may order that the Tenant provide the Landlords with a key to the new lock or pay the Landlords the reasonable cost of changing the lock. 23. Since the Landlords have been given a copy of the key to the existing door lock, the key pad lock can remain on the door. However, since the Landlords object to the style of the new lock, the Tenant shall change the lock back to the original style of lock on or before moving out/vacating the rental unit. Damage to the Rental Unit 24. The L2 application regarding damage is based on an N7 and an N5 Notice of Termination with the same damage claimed. At the hearing, the parties agreed that the damage issue would proceed under the N5 notice which claimed negligently caused damage and the N7 notice claiming wilfully caused damage would not be considered. 25. The Landlords used to live in the townhouse before renting it out. They purchased it in 2015 and it was already about 13 years old at that time. The Landlords provided photos to show they kept the property in pristine condition when they lived there. 26. While I have no doubt that the townhouse is no longer kept in pristine condition and that there has been wear and tear resulting from the Tenant’s large family, section 89 of the Act requires that the Landlord establish undue damage. 27. The Landlord prefers that that Tenant fix the damage and is only seeking payment of an amount for damage if the Tenant fails to fix the damage. 28. Section 89 of the Act permits reasonable repair costs to be claimed. The Landlords are seeking $10,000.00 to repair the alleged damage. They provided a quote to support the amount. However, I am not satisfied that the cost claimed is a reasonable cost of repair. The quote was inflated in many areas. For example, a cost of $350.00 is quoted to re-align the door hinge on the cold room door, an additional $350.00 is quoted to re-align the doors hinges on some kitchen cupboard doors and $850.00 is quoted to reattach the missing insulation from one section of the unfinished basement wall. 29. The Tenant agreed that some of the items being claimed by the Landlord are damage that the Tenant is responsible for since either he or his five children were the cause of the damage. 30. The Tenant provided photographs at the hearing which established that the Tenant has fixed or remedied the damaged bedroom wall by removing the stickers/marks/coloring his child put on walls in one of the children’s bedrooms and has also re-attached the hanging smoke detector to the ceiling. 31. The Tenant has attempted to re-attach insulation in the basement that fell or was knocked down while his children were playing. However, the photos show a gap in the insulation or small areas of the wall that are not fully covered. Therefore, the Tenant is being ordered to reattach the insulation in a manner that fully covers the wall. 32. The Landlords, as the applicants, have the burden of proving the claims in their application. The Landlords failed to establish that the Tenant or his family were the cause of undue damage to the following: leaking kitchen tap; shifting laminate floor boards causing gaps in one area of the living room and in the master bedroom; kitchen cupboard doors not fully aligned; cold room door not fully aligned; condensation build up/leak in furnace; cracked tile around the master bathtub; and water leak mark on living room ceiling. 33. While there is no dispute the tap leaked until the Landlord replaced it or that there is a gap in a few laminate floor boards, the Landlords failed to establish that it was the result of any action of the Tenant or his family that caused these issues. 34. The Landlords argued that there must be extreme fluctuations in temperature in the home since a flooring contractor told them that could cause the floor boards to shift and create gaps. 35. However, this is mere speculation. There was no evidence to suggest that the Tenant sets the heating or cooling in the house to extreme temperatures. 36. The Tenant very reasonably argued that if he did so he and his own family would be uncomfortable by the extreme fluctuations. Also, it would be expected that the floor boards would be shifting in every room and not just in two areas of the home. 37. The Landlords believe that anything that goes wrong at the property after the Tenants took possession of the rental unit must have been caused by the Tenants. However, there is normal and expected wear and tear in a home. Also, things go wrong unexpectedly and items and equipment break down sometimes through no fault of anyone. 38. This belief is supported by the written tenancy agreement which states that the Tenants are responsible to maintenance fixtures and appliances and repair all wear and tear at their own expense. 39. Yet, section 89 of the Act is clear that the Tenant is only responsible for undue damage that they wilfully or negligently caused. Section 4 of the Act states that any term of a tenancy agreement that is inconsistent with the Act is void. 40. The Landlords provided insufficient or no evidence which would suggest that the Tenant or his family were the cause of the kitchen tap drip/leak or the condensation/leak in the ac/furnace. The Landlords’ estimate states that the kitchen tap had a small leak in the cartridge. It is not clear how the Tenant or his family could have caused this and it is more likely than not the result of normal wear and tear and break down of parts. 41. A few kitchen cupboard doors are not perfectly aligned with each other but that can be easily remedied by adjusting the door hinges. The photos the Tenants provided of the doors establish there is no undue damage to the kitchen cupboard doors. The same is true of the cold room door. 42. There is no dispute that there is a cracked tile in the tub deck around the master bathroom tub. The Landlords stated that the Tenant or his family must have caused it. The Tenant argued that it is the result of poor workmanship and shifting since the grout around the tile is missing and/or cracked. 43. There was insufficient evidence provide to conclude that the Tenant or his family negligently caused the cracked tile around the bathtub. 44. There is no dispute that there is a brown water mark/stain on living room ceiling. The Landlords believe there was a leak from the bathroom above the living room that caused the stain. 45. However, the Landlords’ home inspection report dated June 1, 2018 states that there were no signs of active leaking and further investigation is recommended by an expert. The report also notes loose shingles on the roof and recommends remedial work by a licensed roofer. This could be a potential cause of a water leak. 46. There is no dispute that the toilet in the main floor powder room overflowed. Some water seeped down into the unfinished basement below the bathroom. The Landlords did not establish any undue damage from this. The water that pooled on the concrete floor was either mopped up or evaporated over time. 47. It is not enough for the Landlords to prove that there is a defect in an area of the home. Section 89 of the Act requires that the Landlords establish undue damage and that the Tenant, his guests or his family caused it. This was not established for the majority of the items claimed. 48. The Tenant and/or his children caused undue damage to the toilet at the rental unit. The Tenant is responsible for the $270.01 cost of the fixing the clogged toilet in the children’s bathroom. The Landlords provided an invoice from Roto-Router to establish the amount. 49. The invoice from Roto-Router as well as the Landlord’s photos show that the toilet in the children’s bathroom was clogged with items such as a paper clip and a plastic food container. 50. It is more likely than not that one of the Tenant’s five children flushed the items down the toilet since they are the usual types of items you would expect to see stuck in the toilet. 51. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) of the Act. The damage that was established is relatively minor and does not justify termination of the tenancy. Tenant’s Request for a Rent Abatement 52. The Tenant argued that many of the items clamed as damage are actually maintenance issues that the Landlords are responsible for. He requested a rent abatement of 25% for the period from May to August 2018. 53. No rent abatement is warranted in the circumstances. Most of the times are nuisance or inconvenience type items such as misaligned cabinet doors and are likely the result of the heavy usage by the Tenant’s large family. Items such as a cracked tile or a brown mark on the living room ceiling do not impact on the Tenant’s ability to make full and normal use of the rental unit. 54. When larger issues were brought to the Landlords’ attention, such as the broken dishwasher, the Landlords responded promptly to fix the issues. 55. The Tenant argued that the three toilets at the rental unit need to be replaced since they clog frequently and must not be standard size. No evidence was presented to establish that the toilets are unusual in size. The Roto-Router invoice states that all toilets were augured and are in good working order. Any issues with clogging are more likely than not the result of heavy usage by the Tenant’s five children\",\n",
       " \"I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act\",\n",
       " 'Parties have a duty to mitigate their losses in accordance with section 16 of the Act. I find it very unlikely that the Tenant’s linens and mop could not be cleaned and reused. 26. There was surface mold growth on the wall in the furnace room. The Tenant stated that water had been pooling in this area which she believed to be the cause of the mold. The Landlord’s Agent acknowledged that the drain for the air conditioning unit had been clogged with dirt and debris, and once cleaned the water drained properly. The Tenant alleged that the mold on this wall affected the area on the other side of the wall where she stored some personal belongings. According to her, the items in her storage bins smelled like mold. 27. The mold in the furnace room was never addressed by the Landlord. In the last few months, the Tenant has advised the Landlord’s Agent via text messages regarding this issue. The Tenant remarked on the look and smell of the area affected. 28. The area affected by the surface mold is one wall behind the furnace, in a room which also houses the washer and dryer used by the Tenant. Other than the odour, I am not satisfied that the Tenant’s ability to use the laundry room was impacted. Therefore, I find that the Tenant is entitled to a lump sum rent abatement of $200.00 for this issue. 29. The evidence before me was insufficient to find that the Tenant’s storage was affected as a result of the mold issue. There was no dispute that the Tenant utilized the Landlord’s garage for storage and only had to obtain her own storage facilities when she was instructed to remove her belongings from the garage this past June. Also, the Tenant had no photos of her storage items allegedly removed from the storage area behind the furnace room because of the mold on the wall. 30. There was no dispute that the Tenant initially had use of the backyard at the residential complex. When the Landlord’s Agent was fed up with the Tenant failing to clean up after her dogs, as of June 12, 2018, he prohibited the Tenant from using the yard. 31. Based on the uncontested evidence before me I am satisfied that the Landlord’s Agent substantially interfered with the Tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex by prohibiting use of the yard as of June 12, 2018. 32. Therefore, I find that the Tenant is entitled to a lump sum abatement of rent totalling $200.00 for the period of June 12, 2018 to current. I find this amount to be appropriate in these circumstances given that this period of time was during the summer season when the Tenant would have fully utilized the yard for family gatherings, barbeques and other outdoor activities which normally take place outside. 33. Based on the evidence before me, I find it more likely than not that the Landlord’s Agent unlawfully entered the rental unit. I am satisfied that it has only been in recent months where the Landlord’s Agent has provided a written notice stating a date, reasonable timeframe, and reason for entry into the Tenant’s unit. A number of notices were submitted by the Landlord’s Agent into evidence, however the ones that are dated are between August 17, 2018 and September 14, 2018 only. Therefore, prior to this timeframe, I find it more likely than not that the Landlord’s Agent would simply text or call the Tenant to advise of any entries into the unit. 34. The Tenant’s evidence regarding the Landlord’s Agent’s entries was vague, however she did recall that if there was a notice it would be given the day prior and state an entry timeframe of the next day between 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. She further recalled at least three occasions where the Landlord’s Agent entered to show the unit with the tenants from the upper unit with proper sufficient notice. 35. Therefore, I find that the Tenant is entitled to a rent abatement of $150.00, representing $50.00 for each illegal entry. The Tenant was very upset at the Landlord’s Agent entering her unit and on one occasion her son was sleeping in the living area and woke up to a number of people standing over him. 36. I am not satisfied that the Tenant’s issues with parking amounted to a substantial interference by the Landlord. The Tenant acknowledged that she was aware upon renting the unit that parking is available only in tandem in a single driveway. There were no issues in the first few months of the tenancy simply due to the fact that the upper unit was vacant and the Tenant was the only one parking a car in the driveway. The Tenant agreed to this parking arrangement knowing that the upper unit would eventually be rented to other tenants who would also park a vehicle in the driveway. 37. The Tenant and her witness described an incident in the driveway between the Landlord’s Agent and the Tenant’s witness, wherein the Landlord’s Agent yelled at the witness and called him an outsider. There was no dispute that the Landlord opposed anyone else living with the Tenant in the rental unit and was upset that the witness was regularly there. I am not satisfied that this one encounter with the Landlord’s Agent rose to the level of substantial interference with the Tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit. 38. For the reasons above the Tenant is entitled to an abatement of rent totaling $1,170.00. 39. The Tenant is actively seeking out new accommodations for her and her two children. She hopes to have secured a new rental unit for November 1, 2018. 40. The Landlord is requesting payment of the rent arrears or eviction. 41. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until October 31, 2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. The Tenant will not have secured a new place prior to this timeframe, one month’s rent will be paid out from the Board’s trust account and the Landlord is holding a last month’s rent deposit. This delay is not unreasonable',\n",
       " \"However, I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. L1 Application 12. The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from June 1, 2018 to August 31, 2018. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 21, 2018. 13. The monthly rent is $1,000.00. 14. The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,000.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord. 15. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 8, 2018 to July 21, 2018. 16. The Tenant gave evidence that he tried to pay the rent on June 8, 11 and 13, 2018 but the Landlord refused to accept the rent. The Tenant’s witness testified that he was waiting outside when the Tenant tried to pay the rent on June 8 and 20, 2018 but the Landlord did not accept it. The Landlord’s evidence is that on June 8, 2018 the Tenant called while she was in the hospital with her son explaining that the rent will be late that month. On June 11, 2018, he threatened to kill her when she asked for the rent and on June 13, 2018 was verbally abusive towards her but never offered to pay the rent. 17. Based on the evidence before me, I am not convinced that the Tenant offered to pay the rent and the Landlord refused to accept it. The Landlord’s testimony was consistent with the information on her application that she was threatened when she asked for the rent on June 11, 2018. Furthermore, it is not disputed that the rent in arrears was in fact never received by the Landlord. 18. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act\",\n",
       " 'The Landlord replaced the leaking basement window in a reasonable amount of time and in accordance with Onyskiw there is no breach of section 20. The Tenant reported the issue on July 3rd and the window was replaced two and one half weeks later. The Landlord took steps on July 6th to clear debris from the window well and divert roof water away from the window to minimize any leak until the window was replaced. The window was scheduled to be replaced on July 14th however the contractor delayed the installation to July 20th because of rain. This claim is dismissed. Insulation 17. The Tenant’s claim that exposed insulation in the furnace room is toxic is dismissed. The Tenant did not provide sufficient evidence to support his claim. The Landlord said there is only sound proofing material in the furnace room which is not unsafe. Water leaks, mould 18. The Tenant testified that there are airborne mould spores in the unit because of water damage in the subfloor. He said there is a pungent odour in the entire unit as of January 2018. The Tenant displayed dark staining on the lower part of a wall in the living room which he said is mould. He submitted photos of the laminate flooring which shows dark staining and also submitted a photo of his DVD player which he said sustained water damage. 19. In early November 2017, a pipe leaked behind the closet wall. The Tenant said he shut off the water and reported the issue to the Landlord who repaired the pipe a few hours later. The Tenant said there have been six further leaks in the unit including on August 9th and August 17th. The Tenant claims damage to personal property including a DVD player, Xbox, DVD/CDs, comforters, couch legs and computer drives because of the leaks. 20. The Landlord testified that after the closet pipe leak, there was a second leak on August 9th because of a rain storm. A contractor attended the unit on August 13th to investigate the source of the leak and found a foundation crack. The wall had to be completely dry to seal the leak and repair was delayed until August 20th because of heavy rains on August 16th and 17th. The Landlord instructed the Tenant to keep a fan and dehumidifier running and use a towel to contain the moisture. The Landlord said his contractor advised him that the fan and dehumidifier were turned off twice when he came to the unit. 21. The Landlord did not breach section 20 regarding the pipe leak in the closet and the foundation leak. The Landlord responded reasonably and promptly and the evidence does not demonstrate that the Landlord could have known about either leak which resulted from a pipe behind the wall and a foundation crack behind drywall. The Landlord repaired the first leak in the closet pipe promptly. The Landlord’s contractor came to the unit on August 13th (regarding the August 9th leak) and August 20th regarding the foundation crack. The contractor confirmed there was one foundation crack as of September 1st and the crack was repaired on September 9th, 2018. The Landlord submitted an invoice from Shape Carpentry dated September 10th to support the completion of the repair. As any damage to the Tenant’s property was not caused by the Landlord’s failure to comply with his obligation to maintain the rental unit, the Landlord is not responsible for these costs. Furthermore, the amount of water leaking into the unit was minimal and did not present a substantial impact to the Tenant. 22. However the Landlord failed to maintain the laminate flooring in the unit in a good state of repair. The photos from the Tenant show that the flooring has sustained water damage from the leaks and is stained/discoloured. The issue is cosmetic and does not warrant an abatement however I am ordering repair. 23. Regarding the Tenant’s claim of mould in the unit, I am not satisfied that there is mould in unit. An email from TT, a municipal law enforcement officer dated September 10, 2018 indicates that she did not observe any visible mould during her inspection in early August 2018. A report from Shape Carpentry dated September 10, 2018 also states that no mould was observed during investigation of the foundation crack in the unit. The Tenant did not provide any other evidence such as an air quality testing report to support his testimony of air borne mould. Garage door key pad 24. The Tenant testified that the key pad on the garage door fails sometimes mostly in colder weather. He said attempted repair by the Landlord has not been successful. The Landlord said the only issue he became aware of related to the garage door was a malfunctioning spring which he repaired within four days of discovering it. 25. The Tenant has not provided sufficient evidence regarding any repair required to the garage door key pad. Washer 26. The Tenant testified that there is a smell of sewage from the washer because there is no p-trap. He said this appliance damages his clothing but he is able to use it. The Landlord denies any repair issue required to the washer. He inspected the appliance on July 6th, found a p-trap installed and did not detect any sewer gas odours. The Tenant has not provided sufficient evidence that there is any repair required to the washer. This claim is dismissed. 27. The Tenant testified that there is a missing dryer vent which creates high humidity in the unit and which he believes will cause mould. The Landlord testified the dryer is indoor vented into the unit with a lint catcher. The Tenant has not substantiated any repair required to the dryer vent such that the dryer must be vented outside. This claim is dismissed. Mice, maggots 28. The Tenant testified that there are mice and maggots in the unit. He said he took care of the mice by purchasing traps. He said the Landlord told him there was a sound device in the kitchen to discourage mice however he saw a dead rat under the kitchen sink and he continues to hear mice. He said he also saw maggots once for two days in early July and August 2018. He submitted a photo of the maggots. The Tenant sent the Landlord a text message on July 10th and August 9th reporting maggots. 29. The Tenant has not provided sufficient evidence regarding mice in the unit. There were no photos submitted of mice. It is probable there were some type of pests on the two occasions the Tenant described, however the impact was minimal based on the Tenant’s own evidence and the issue has not reoccurred since August 9th, 2018. This does not constitute a breach of section 20. This claim is dismissed. Relief from eviction 30. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act and find that it would not be necessary to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act because the Tenant said he could pay the amount owing by September 30, 2018 and as of the date of this order, this date is within the 11 days usually allowed to a tenant to repay any rent owing',\n",

No. 2792 (Div.Ct.), the Landlords in good faith require possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. 17. The Landlords waive the lawful monthly rent for September 2018, which represents the amount required to be paid to the Tenant in accordance with subsections 48.1 and 55.1 of the Act. This amount has been credited as a payment toward the rent arrears under the L1 application. Section 83 18.

Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 1, 2014 to August 10, 2018. 12. The Tenant paid $3,250.00 after the application was filed. 13. The Tenant maintained his dispute against the rent arrears and provided no information regarding payment any arrears found to be owing. However, he stated that an eviction would be extremely stressful on his family. 14. The Landlord requested final termination of this tenancy because of the rent arrears and persistent late payment of the rent. 15. Having considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, I find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction related to non-payment of rent (L1 application) until October 31, 2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. As well, I find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction related to persistent late payment of rent (L2 application) subject to the conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. 16. This is a long term tenancy of approximately four years.

       " 'In accordance with Ontario Regulation 516/06, the weighted useful life of a “hot water boiler” is fifteen years. 15. As per interim order CEL-82129-19 issued on February 11, 2019, the Landlord was ordered to install a fully functional hot water tank by midnight of February 13, 2019. There was no dispute that the Landlord installed a new hot water tank at the rental unit on February 26, 2019. TN argued that the Landlord breached the interim order and as such she is entitled to a 50% abatement for February 2019 as stated in the interim order. 16. It is not uncommon for a landlord to be ordered pursuant to an interim order to correct a possible serious maintenance breach such as an issue with hot water, which is a vital service. However, I find that the requirement to install or replace a water tank within 48 hours imposed a standard that was most likely impossible for the Landlord to meet. 17. The Landlord was able to have a new hot water tank installed and fully functioning within two weeks of the interim order. I find this timeframe reasonable given that the order had to be forwarded to the property manager, a hot water tank would have to be sized, ordered, delivered, and installed. There was also evidence that additional components for the tank had to be purchased separately and were done so at varying retailers. 18. Despite the fact that I find that the Landlord reasonably and substantially complied with the interim order. The Tenants’ issue was a lack of hot water in the rental unit as reported since November 9, 2018. Given the age of the previous hot water tank and that it was past its useful life, I find it more likely than not that the Tenants experienced issues with hot water at the rental unit from November 9, 2018 to February 26, 2019. 19. However, since TN still maintains that there are issues with hot water at the unit even after receiving a new hot water tank, I am not convinced that there was no hot water during the period of November 9, 2018 to February 26, 2019. I find it more likely than not that it is simply an issue of the Tenants expecting a higher standard than that which is reasonable and/or warranted. Especially, given the Landlord’s direct evidence of the water in a filled bathtub maintaining a temperature over 111 degrees Celsius. 20. Consequently, I find that the Tenant is only entitled to an abatement of rent of $592.50, representing a half month’s rent for the period of November 9, 2018 to February 26, 2019. This is the amount ordered in the interim order and conceded by the Landlord. Cracked window 21. There is no dispute that the window in the second bedroom is cracked. The best evidence before me regarding when the Tenants informed the Landlord of this issue was the Tenants’ request for maintenance form dated December 17, 2018. The Landlord only recently, on March 18, 2019, ordered a replacement window. Since it took over three months for the Landlord to respond to this issue, I find this to be unreasonable and it amounts to a breach of section 20 of the Act. 22. JM stated that this is a two pane window and only the interior pane is cracked. As such the rental unit is not compromised by the exterior elements. He confirmed that a new window has been ordered and they are awaiting delivery to confirm an install date. 23. TN disputed that the window is two panes, however the evidence before me was insufficient to refute JM’s testimony. He was candid and forthcoming. Also, since the invoice for the replacement window states “supply and install 3 sealed units to include low E and argon gas with super spacer,” I am satisfied that the existing window is also double pane window, why else would argon gas and a spacer be present. 24. TN stated that as a result of the cracked window she has been unable to use the second bedroom. Given that the window is a double pane glass, I am not convinced that this crack renders the bedroom completely unusable. However, I am satisfied that there is some impact on the Tenants by having this large crack in the second bedroom window. 25. Therefore, I find that the an abatement of rent of 5% for the months of December 2018, January, February, March and April 2019 to be appropriate in these circumstances. The Tenants are entitled to an abatement of rent totalling $296.25 ($1,185.00 x .05 x 5) for this issue. Toilet seat 26. There was no dispute that the toilet seat in the rental unit was broken. According to JM, the seat was floating as the attachments to the base were broken. The best evidence before me regarding when the Tenants informed the Landlord of this issue was the Tenants’ request for maintenance form dated December 17, 2018. The toilet seat was replaced on February 21, 2019. Since it took over two months for the Landlord to respond to this issue, I find this to be unreasonable and it amounts to a breach of section 20 of the Act. 27. TN did not provide specific evidence regarding the impact of this broken toilet seat had on the Tenants. I find it more likely than not that the impact was minor. Therefore, I find that the Tenants are entitled to a lump sum abatement of rent of $50.00 which is both appropriate and proportionate in these circumstances. Baseboard mold 28. TN stated that there was mold on the baseboards in the room that houses the hot water tank. She undertook to clean it. 29. The evidence before me was insufficient to find that this issue was reported to the Landlord. TN relied on four request for maintenance forms submitted for the period of November 2018 to March 2019. This issue is not mentioned on any of those forms. As well, there was no dispute that the issue was not addressed with the TN’s initial cleaning of the area. JM also stated that cleaned the area behind the hot water tank prior to the installation of the new hot water tank. Unclean and unpainted unit 30. TN alleged that when she moved into the unit, it had not been cleaned or painted. There was no dispute that this tenancy was to commence on November 1, 2018. However, there was no dispute that Tenants were in possession of the rental unit prior to this date. 31. VD stated that she found the rental unit insecure and occupied by the Tenants around October 18, 2018 during an inspection to get the unit ready for the new tenancy. 32. Given the uncontested evidence, I find it likely that the Tenants had or took possession of the rental unit early. As such, the Landlord did not have an opportunity to clean and prepare the unit. The Tenants occupied the rental unit for the period of October 18, 2018 to October 31, 2018 prior to the tenancy commencing and were not required to pay rent. I find it likely that the Tenants occupied the unit early in exchange for cleaning and painting the unit at their own costs. Harassment 33. TN stated that there were two occasions in November 2018 where the Landlord’s Agents, four people in total, showed up at the rental unit without any notice. TN confirmed that they were there to do maintenance checks. However, they did not enter the unit. 34. Based on the evidence before me, I am not satisfied that these two incidents amount to harassment. There was no dispute that the Landlord’s Agents were simply there to do maintenance checks. They did not enter the unit, therefore there was no unlawful entry either. 35. TN stated that the Superintendent is watching the cameras and making notes of her and her guests’ activities. There is no dispute that the common areas of the residential complex are equipped with cameras. 36. VD testified that as part of her duties, she reviews the videotape from the previous night. According to her, there were security issues in the past and now checking and following up on potential issues found on the videotape is standard protocol. She stated that TN is not singled out, all activities in the common areas are being monitored. 37. Based on the evidence before me, I am not satisfied that the Superintendent’s conduct amounts to harassment. While I understand that TN is upset at her activities being seen on camera, she was advised and is aware that the cameras are present and being monitored. Consequently, there is a reasonable expectation that activities in the area are monitored. Whether or not the Superintendent takes notes of the activities seen on the videotape on its own also does not amount to harassment. There was insufficient evidence before me that these notes were disclosed to anyone other than the Tenant. 38. There was insufficient evidence before me that the Superintendent or another agent of the Landlord harassed the Tenants’ guests or the Tenants by standing near their door. TN did not provide any specific dates when these alleged interactions occurred. 39. Given the above findings, the Tenant is entitled to an abatement of rent totalling $938.75. Section 83 40. TN had requested and hoped for a complete offset of the rent arrears as a result of the issues raised pursuant to section 82 of the Act. TN submitted that she is disabled and not capable of moving. She also mentioned that the year prior to residing at the rental unit she was living in a shelter. 41. The Landlord requested an order for payment of the rent arrears and eviction if not paid in the standard time frame. 42. Having considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, I find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. 43. This tenancy only commenced as of November 1, 2018 and the rent arrears claimed in this application are owing since December 1, 2018. The rent arrears owing are now substantial. TN offered no ability to pay the arrears. The Tenants also did not fully comply with the payment requirement in the interim order. Given the short history of this tenancy combined with the substantial rent arrears owing and no ability to pay, it would be unfair to grant any relief from eviction',\n",
       " \"Under these circumstances and in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), I find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act Section 82 12. At the hearing the Tenant raised issues pursuant to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). Tenant’s evidence 13. The Tenant acknowledged that he owes the Landlord rent and also that he only made a partial payment for the month of January. 14. He explained that he attempted to pay the Landlord in cash during the month of January, however, the timing did not work. He is prepared to pay the rent he owes but is upset that his daughter’s bed was damaged. 15. The Tenant produced photographs which show a white child’s bedframe with a significant crack. The Tenant alleges the Landlord son caused the crack to the bedframe while moving it during the flood repair. 16. The Tenant did not dispute the Landlord’s son’s characterization of the Tenants’ as unhelpful. Nor did the Tenant dispute the characterization of the Landlord’s son that the Tenants simply sat in the living room and refused to help when asked them to assist with removing the furniture in the room. The Tenant testified that it is the Landlord’s responsibility to repair damage caused by flooding. Landlord’s evidence 17. The Landlord did not attend the hearing, his son did it in his place. He explained that he was responsible for resolving the flooding issue that occurred in the rental unit last Christmas season. 18. The Landlord’s son explained that he was notified by the Tenants of the flood in their unit around December 29. He testified that when he arrived at the rental unit the Tenants did not cooperate with his efforts to resolve the flooding issue and instead stayed in the other room and offered him no assistance. He testified that he did in fact move the furniture in the affected bedroom, which is the bedroom occupied by the Tenants’ small child. 19. He conceded that he and the Tenant had had several arguments following the flood, and that he was frustrated by what he perceived to be the Tenants’ unwillingness to assist him. Analysis 20. I find that it is more likely than not that the Landlord’s son inadvertently caused damage to the bedframe while attempting to move it so that he could install dehumidifiers. 21. The Tenant is correct that it is the Landlord’s responsibility to repair damage caused by flooding. However, section 16 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act) also requires parties to take reasonable steps to minimize their losses. In this case, it was unreasonable for the Tenant to leave simply the bedframe in a flooded area and there is no reason that the Tenant could not have assisted by ensuring that his and his family’s belongings were safely removed. 22. The Tenant produced a receipt for purchase of a replacement bed from Pottery Barn in the amount of $550.00. Having regard to the lack of evidence before me that the bedframe could not be repaired, the age of the bed and the Tenant’s failure to minimize the damages, I find the Tenants are entitled to be compensate for 50% of the replacement cost ($275.00). This amount shall be deducted from the arrears of rent owing by the Tenants\",\n",

       " 'The Tenant stated that there were numerous on-going issues, however only the issues in the application can be considered at this hearing. In the application, the Tenant alleged the following: a) Unfinished renovations including: missing drywall, incomplete flooring, bathroom plumbing not completed; b) No heat; c) Water leak/penetration; and d) Mold. 3. Subsection 20(1) of the Act states the following: A landlord is responsible for providing and maintaining a residential complex, including the rental units in it, in a good state of repair and fit for habitation and for complying with health, safety, housing and maintenance standards. 4. In the recent decision in Onyskiw v. CJM Property Management, 2016 ONCA 477 (Onyskiw), the Court of Appeal for Ontario determined that a contextual approach should be adopted when considering a landlord’s potential breach of subsection 20(1) of the Act and a breach will not be found if the landlord’s response to a maintenance issue was reasonable in the circumstances. 5. The Tenant viewed the rental unit which was under renovation on August 17, 2017. At that time the parties entered into a tenancy agreement for occupation as of September 1, 2017. The monthly rent for the unit is $1,500.00. This application was filed on October 3, 2017. 6. The Tenant stated that on September 1, 2017, she was asked to move in later in the day to allow the workers to finish the renovations. Upon moving into the rental unit, the Tenant asserted that the unit was not usable. The drywall was incomplete; mudding, sanding and painting was still to be done. There was missing flooring in the hallway and kitchen. There was no working toilet. There were issues with both water and hot water in the bathroom. According to the Tenant, the unit was not livable for approximately three weeks. The Tenant submitted and relied on photographs taken by herself regarding the condition of the unit in the month of September 2017. 7. According to the Tenant, shortly after the completion of the unit, on September 26, 2017, she discovered a water under one of her daughter’s beds. She had removed a suitcase being stored under the bed and it was wet and moldy. She then also discovered a puddle of water on the floor in the master bedroom. The Tenant submitted that three mattresses which were on the floor in the bedrooms were damaged as a result of exposure to water and mold. 8. There was no dispute that the Tenant contacted the Landlord’s office regarding the issue of the water pooling. According to the Tenant, once the sub-pump was turned on there were no further issues of water pooling. Although, there was evidence of water damage in the corner of her children’s bedroom. Someone from the Landlord’s office attended and pulled away the trim and cut out drywall from this area. The Tenant stated that this area was not repaired until just before Christmas. 9. According to the Tenant, the heat at the rental unit was non-existent until October 16, 2017 when a working thermostat was installed. However, after this time she continued to have periodic issues with insufficient heat. Each time there was an issue with the furnace, the Tenant reported the issue and the Landlord’s contractor attended. The Tenant also confirmed that she was given space heaters to use from the Landlord’s contractor. 10. The Tenant’s witness and the Landlord’s former assistant, BB, testified that she was present on the Tenant’s move in date of September 1, 2017. She confirmed that the renovations at the rental unit were not completed at that time. She stated that drywall was still being installed and the bathroom was not finished. She also testified that she was the one who removed the trim in the corner of the bedroom after the Tenant reported a leak. She said the area was mushy and just fell apart when touched. 11. The Tenant’s witness, the upper unit tenant, LM, testified that there were issues with heat at the residential complex and it was constantly having to be turned up or down during this period of time. 12. AB acknowledged that the premises were under renovation prior to the Tenant taking possession. He stated that the unit was available for occupancy as of September 1, 2017. In support of this assertion, a copy of the occupancy permit and inspection report provided by the Town of Midland issued September 1, 2017 was submitted into evidence. In response to the Tenant’s photographs, AB submitted that the Tenant had access to the rental unit prior to taking occupancy and believed that some of the pictures submitted by the Tenant were taken prior to September 1, 2017. 13. AB also acknowledged that there was an issue with water penetration into the unit. He attended the unit to view the Tenant’s alleged damage to property. During his visit, the Tenant did not show him the damaged mattresses or any other items. He did see the area of the bedroom where some drywall and trim was removed. He confirmed that area would be fixed once the exterior work regarding the water penetration was completed. 14. The Landlord’s property manager as of mid-October 2017, RH, testified that he also attended the rental unit to view the Tenant’s damaged property. He confirmed that there were three mattresses stacked in one of the rooms, he could not determine their age however did notice that there was some pilling on the side of one of the mattresses. He further testified that there was no evidence of water damage/staining in the master bedroom. He confirmed that the corner area of the other bedroom still had exposed drywall. 15. RH acknowledge an issue with lack of heat reported by the Tenant. He recalled at least two other service requests regarding this issue. He had a heating company attend and address this issue each time service was requested. 16. The Landlord’s current service manager, LD, testified that he attended the rental unit approximately 6-7 times and had discussions with the Tenant regarding her issues. He testified that there are currently no outstanding maintenance issues at the rental unit. He submitted that the drywall and trim in the corner of the bedroom was addressed within one to two weeks of the repairs to the exterior being completed. He could not state a date for sure. He also acknowledged that there were additional drywall repairs at the rental unit related to a water leak from the furnace line. He believed the area of the living room was affected for this repair. In any event, he stated that both repairs were just cosmetic, nothing that would prevent the Tenant from living in the rental unit. 17. LD further acknowledged there were heating issues at the rental unit. He was not aware of any current heating issue. At the hearing, the Tenant stated that there was an issue the week prior, however LD confirmed under cross-examination that he was not made aware of that issue. LD testified that they responded to the Tenant’s reported issues in a reasonable time frame. LD further confirmed that the Tenant was supplied with secondary heating units. 18. Based on the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the Landlord breach section 20 of the Act as the rental unit was in disrepair during the month of September 2017. In this regard, I preferred the testimony of the Tenant’s witness, BB, who was on site on the Tenant’s move in date. While although, I am satisfied that the witness, BB, is emotional towards her former employer, I found her testimony regarding this issue consistent, credible and corroborated the Tenant’s evidence. In any event, other than the inspection reports and occupancy permit submitted, AB and the Landlord’s other witnesses did not provide direct testimony as to the condition of the rental unit in September 2017. 19. As a result of the disrepair in the rental unit at this time the Tenant’s belongings were piled in the middle of the rooms covered in plastic awaiting the completion of drywall and painting. The Tenant’s evidence was also uncontested as to the condition of the bathroom in September 2017, specifically having no working toilet for a few days, no hot water for a number of days, and no use of the shower for approximately two weeks. 20. The Tenant requested an abatement of rent totalling $4,500.00 equal to three month’s rent for all the issues in both applications. With respect to this issue, I find a 50% abatement for three weeks, being $562.50 ($1,500.00 x 0.75 x 0.50) to be more appropriate in these circumstances. 21. The Tenant’s uncontested evidence that all the repair issues related to this disrepair were completed within three weeks of the Tenant moving into the unit. A specific timeline for the completion of each of the repairs was not provided, however, the Tenant confirmed that some issues were completed prior to three weeks such as the toilet and shower. Therefore, I am satisfied that 50% abatement for this period is appropriate given that only the Tenant was able to occupy the unit during this time, as her children were sent to live with their father due to the condition of the unit. However, since the Tenant continued to live at the unit during this time, a full abatement of rent as requested was not warranted. 22. Based on the evidence before me I am not satisfied that the Landlord breached section 20 with respect to the issues related to heating. There was no dispute that the Landlord responded immediately to each of the Tenant’s complaints. As well, the Tenant was able to contact the Landlord’s contractor directly after hours to report any problems with the heat, which the Tenant had done on at least one occasion. She also confirmed that the contractor regularly attended the unit after she reported an issue. In accordance with Onyskiw, a breach will not be found if the Landlord’s response was reasonable in the circumstances. Not only did the Landlord’s contractor address the heating issues consistently and promptly, they also provided the Tenant with a secondary heating source, namely space heaters. 23. Based on the evidence before me I am satisfied the Landlord breached section 20 of the Act due to the disrepair of the drywall and trim in one area of the bedroom related to the water penetration. This area was not repaired by the Landlord for approximately two months. 24. The Tenant requested an abatement of rent totalling $4,500.00 equal to three month’s rent for all the issues in both applications. With respect to this issue, I find a 5% abatement for two months, being $150.00 ($1,500.00 x 0.05 x 2) to be more appropriate in these circumstances. The Tenant stated that this area was not repaired for approximately two months. The Landlord’s service manager disagreed and found that timeframe to be too lengthy but could not confirm a completion date. Therefore, I preferred the evidence of the Tenant. I find a 5% abatement to be appropriate as I am satisfied that having this area in disrepair had a minimal impact on the Tenant’s ability to occupy the premises. This was a small area in the corner of one of the bedrooms. A full abatement of rent for two months is not warranted. 25. With respect to the water penetration and mold allegations. It was uncontested that the Landlord acted immediately and effectively to address the water penetration issue. Other than this one time of water pooling in the bedrooms, there was no evidence provided by the Tenant that the issue was on-going. Therefore, in accordance with Onyskiw, I am satisfied that the Landlord did not breach section 20 of the Act as he acted reasonably with respect to the water penetration at the rental unit. 26. There was no evidence provided that the Landlord was aware of an issue with water penetration prior to the Tenant moving into the rental unit. The Landlord had recently purchased this residential complex and renovated the interior. This issue of water penetration was unknown until it occurred. Since, I am not satisfied the Landlord breached section 20 of the Act, consequently, I am not considering the Tenant’s request for costs to replace property that was damaged because the Landlord did not maintain the rental unit or residential complex. 27. In any event, the Tenant did not substantiate the replacement costs requested. She did not provide any receipts for the items claimed. She simply estimated their costs based on similar items found on the internet. As well, the Tenant confirmed that she received replacement mattresses at no cost. The amount for replacing three mattresses representing the majority of the total amount requested by the Tenant. 28. The evidence before me was insufficient to find that there is a mold issue in the rental unit. None of the witnesses who attended the rental unit testified to the presence of mold. And the Tenant only referred to mold regarding her property damage, which she confirmed she discarded. 29. The total abatement of rent with respect to this application is $712.50 for the period of September 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017 as stated above. Regarding CET-70509-17 30. The issue in this application is whether the Landlord harassed and/or threatened the Tenant, substantially interfered with the Tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit and withheld or deliberately interfered with the reasonable supply of a vital service, namely heat, water and hot water that the Landlords are obligated to supply under the tenancy agreement. Some of the allegations regarding substantial interference with the Tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit related to the Landlord’s failure to maintain the rental unit. Those issues were addressed in application CET-70370-17 above and any remedy given considered whether or not substantial interference with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit was affected. 31. Subsection 21(1) of the Act states the following: A landlord shall not at any time during a tenant’s occupancy of a rental unit and before the day on which an order evicting the tenant is executed, withhold the reasonable supply of any vital service, care service or food that it is the landlord’s obligation to supply under the tenancy agreement or deliberately interfere with the reasonable supply of any vital service, care service or food. 32. Subsection 2(1) of the Act describes a vital service: means hot or cold water, fuel, electricity, gas or, during the part of each year prescribed by the regulations, heat. 33. Section 22 of the Act states the following: A landlord shall not at any time during a tenant’s occupancy of a rental unit and before the day on which an order evicting the tenant is executed substantially interfere with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or the residential complex in which it is located for all usual purposes by a tenant or members of his or her household. 34. Section 23 of the Act states the following: A landlord shall not harass, obstruct, coerce, threaten or interfere with a tenant. 35. There was no dispute that the Tenant’s issues with water/hot water at the commencement of the tenancy and heating during the tenancy were the result of disrepairs as pleaded and found in application CET-70370-17. Given this, as required by subsection 21(1) of the Act, I am not satisfied that the Landlord withheld or deliberately interfered with these vital services. 36. The Tenant alleged that the Landlord was responsible for a break-in at her unit on September 24, 2017 as the key to the Landlord’s lock box had gone missing. The Tenant also alleged that the person who broke into the unit was a former contractor for the Landlord. The Tenant’s witness, LM, testified she heard banging in the Tenant’s unit and the Tenant’s dog barking for long period of time on September 23, 2017. 37. The Tenant stated that she came home late on September 23, 2017 to find her animals uneasy and the lights on in her rental unit. She contacted the police to report a possible break-in according to the police report submitted into evidence. The Tenant confirmed that nothing was missing or disturbed. 38. The evidence before me was insufficient to find that the Landlord or a contractor/ employee of the Landlord was responsible for an alleged break in at the rental unit. The evidence regarding this incident was inconsistent. At the hearing, the Tenant testified that she came home to find her lights on and her animals uneasy. The police report stated that the Tenant came home to also find her door unlocked. This was not stated at the hearing. As well, the Tenant’s witness, BB, testified that the Tenant had provided her with a description of a person leaving the premises that night. The Tenant did not testify that she had seen a person leaving her unit nor was this reported to the police. 39. The Tenant also contacted the police on October 3, 2017 to report an unwanted person at her rental unit. According to the Tenant, she discovered “B,” who she believed was not supposed to be on the property, working on the exterior of the premises. She stated that she received an email from the Landlord advising of a property management change and that the old property management company personnel should not be at the premises. The Tenant’s witnesses, BB and LM, also confirmed the existence of this email. However, a copy of the email was not submitted into evidence. 40. The Landlord’s company divided the duties of construction and property maintenance to two different companies, one of which is owned and operated directly by the Landlord’s company. I find it more likely than not that the Tenant and her witnesses confused the message in the email. 41. In any event, I am not satisfied that this person working on the exterior of the rental unit substantially interfered with the Tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of the premises. The police confirmed with “B” that he was hired by the Landlord to work on the siding, yet the Tenant insisted that he leave the premises which he did. I find it more likely than not that the Tenant interfered with the Landlord’s ability to complete repairs to the exterior of the unit by forcing this authorized person to leave. The Tenant confirmed that the person was not in her rental unit. 42. The Tenant alleged that when AB attended her rental unit on September 29, 2017, he was unprofessional and threatened her with an eviction. She stated that AB clearly just wanted to get this meeting at the rental unit “done and over with.” According to her, he kept stating “what’s the issue” even though she directed him to the issue right in front of him. Then he left abruptly and told her to deal with the property manager. She also stated that he threatened to evict her. 43. The Tenant’s witness, BB, testified that AB had asked if she would attend with him on this date, when she responded “no,” he screamed at her to “get the Tenant out.” BB also confirmed that during her employment with the Landlord that AB had only attended one other rental unit. 44. AB contended that he doesn’t attend rental units, this is the property manager’s role. However, since the Tenant was so unhappy, he felt he should attend personally to inspect the unit and review the Tenant’s issues. While at the unit, AB stated that the Tenant maintained there was water damage in the other bedroom (master), he asked her to show him and she never did. 45. According to AB, the Tenant was having trouble speaking as she was very emotional. When she started texting on her phone, he decided to leave. She came out in tears asking him to come back into the unit. He returned and viewed the corner area of the one bedroom that had some drywall and trim removed because of the water penetration. He confirmed with her that they are completing a foundation repair and then would repair this area. He will let the property management know to follow up. 46. AB denied that he threatened eviction. He stated that he told her to pay her rent into the Board in trust and she should call property standards. The Landlord’s witness, RH, also testified the Tenant regularly challenged him on everything he was saying or doing during their interactions. 47. The evidence before me was insufficient to find that the Landlord harassed or threatened the Tenant with an eviction on September 29, 2017. I find it more likely than not that the parties were simply at odds with respect to the issues at the rental unit. I also find it more likely than not that the Tenant advised AB in this encounter that she would be filing an application with the Board given the time of her file date which would lead AB to advise her to pay her rent into the Board to avoid an eviction. 48. The Tenant has failed to prove on a balance of probabilities regarding the issues in this application that the Landlord or the Landlord’s agent harassed and/or threatened her or substantially interfered with her reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or that of another family member. Consequently, the application is dismissed. Regarding CEL-71395-17 49. The Tenant did not dispute the rent arrears of $7,500.00 owing to February 28, 2018 as claimed by the Landlord. 50. The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from October 1, 2017 to February 28, 2018. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective November 14, 2017. 51. The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,500.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord. 52. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 1, 2017 to November 14, 2017. 53. The Tenant would like to continue the tenancy. She believed that there would be no rent arrears owing given the issues in her application. However, if rent arrears are found to be owing she stated that she would need approximately one year to pay off the outstanding amount. She is on ODSP and receives CTC for her three children. She currently does not receive any support payments for the children. 54. AB submitted that the rent arrears are substantial. The Tenant has not made any payments towards the rent since paying first and last month’s rent at the commencement of this tenancy. He submitted that he has previously attempted to negotiate rental payments with her to no avail. 55. Having considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, I find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. 56. This is a young tenancy, the Tenant only moved into the rental unit as of September 1, 2017 and did not pay any rent since that time. The rent arrears are substantial, I am not satisfied that there is a reasonable expectation that the Tenant can pay the rent arrears in a reasonable time frame. A one year repayment plan is not reasonable given that the Tenant has only lived in the rental unit for six months',\n",
       " \"I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance withsubsection 83(2)of theResidential Tenancies Act, 2006(the 'Act'), including the failure of the Landlord to maintain the rental unit in a good state of repair and fit for habitation as described below and the reasons for the rent arrears being directly related to substantial maintenance problems and I find that it would be fair to grant relief from eviction pursuant tosubsection 83(1)of theAct. Harassment and Interference with Substantial Enjoyment – T2 Application 5. The T2 Application is largely the same as the T6 Application, except for the complaint that the Tenants received too many N12 notices and it was claimed the N8 notice was served in retaliation for the Tenants’ complaints. 6. Counsel for the Landlord explained in writing that the N12 notice sent with his letter dated March 7, 2018 had an incorrect termination date on it thus necessitating the need for it to be rescinded and replaced with a correct N12, which he did in March 2018. 7. I am satisfied the Landlord was not acting in bad faith with respect to the N12 notice served on March 8, 2018 and replaced four days later, and the N8 notice to terminate the tenancy served on March 12, 2018 for persistently late payment of rent. The Landlord was entitled to serve the notices to enforce his rights under the Act – the Tenants having had a history of being late with rent payments. Further, I accept the explanation of counsel for the Landlord regarding the need for a replacement of the N12 initially given to the Tenants. Thus, I am not satisfied the Landlord acted so as to substantially interfere with the Tenants and harass them with respect to the N8 and N12 notices. Maintenance – T6 Application 8. ArM said at the time the Tenants took occupancy of the 2,500 square foot house with their daughter and two sons on January 23, 2016, they informed the Landlord’s Realtor/Agent, JT, that there were some maintenance problems with the unit which they later identified in a follow-up email to JT dated May 15, 2016 regarding clogged eaves troughs, washroom drains clogged, dishwasher not working, and fireplace not working. The Tenants alleged JT took pictures of some of the maintenance problems but nothing was done to fix them. 9. The Landlord had bought the house that constitutes the rental unit in the spring of 2015. According to an email sent to the Landlord’s father by LC, a real estate agent who represented the vendor on the sale of the house to the Landlord, and dated April 19, 2018, she confirmed that the house needed work when it was bought by the Landlord. 10. LC, who had been looking for alternative accommodation for the Tenants, volunteered in emails in April and May 2018 that the Tenants had not demanded the Landlord fix the obvious and serious maintenance problems because they were afraid they would have to vacate the rental unit because they did not want to live in a house under construction and there were no other suitable places for the right rent. She also wrote she was frustrated with the male Tenant that he would continually put his family’s health in harm’s way. LC was not called as a witness. 11. It would appear LC was not fully informed regarding Tenants’ complaints to the Landlord for as early as May 15, 2016 as stated above 12. By January 2017, Tenants’ complaints regarding maintenance problems such as the need to repair or remove the mould, fix the bathroom, the window screens, fireplace, dishwasher, dryer, main entrance steps that led to dead mice and insects that they had shown JT and their demand for reimbursement of $300 for a pest control invoice the Tenants paid, appear to have triggered the issuance of a notice of termination of the lease and a demand for payment. I am satisfied the Tenants have timely notified the Landlord by writing and by showing him these many maintenance problems. 13. On behalf of the Landlord an invoice was presented dated February 5, 2016 and issued by the handyman he used regarding work at the rental unit, including a charge of $100 with respect to mould in the basement and $1,000 for repairing the shower and the faucet in the master bedroom. An email written by JT with regard to the work charged by that invoice indicates that on February 29, 2015 the handyman had finished much the same work that is outlined in his February 5, 2016 invoice. Nevertheless, the Tenants disputed the handyman fixed those problems because water splashed everywhere in the master bathroom when the upper shower or lower water faucet is turned on and the Tenants complained they have to take a bath in the common bathroom. Indeed, the handyman is quoted as having told JT the faucet is too old and the valve inside is loose. He is also reported as having said to replace the water faucet, some part of the bathroom wall and tiles have to be opened up. 14. JT acknowledged in an email written in June 2017 that the Tenants continually reported damages but despite evidence to the contrary, she maintained they were remedied by the contractor. JT also wrote that due to the many requests for repairs, and those repairs having been needed because of damage caused by the Tenants, on January 19, 2017 the Landlord gave the notice to end the tenancy on March 31, 2017. She also wrote that the Landlord has decided to make major renovations so that the rental unit will be habitable and therefore he would like the Tenants to move out as soon as possible. 15. JT testified at the hearing but was generally uncooperative and refused to answer a relevant question put to her under cross-examination. I did not find her testimony compelling. 16. The handyman was called to testify regarding the work he did at the rental unit but his evidence was vague and lacked coherence to such an extent that I find it was unreliable. 17. The Tenants presented two invoices, both dated May 12, 2017 issued by the same numbered company owned by a relative of theirs for what appears to be the same work but at different prices. AbM said a relative of theirs did the repairs described in the invoices, such as fixing the toilet leak and the shower faucet and the sink drain, but he was unable to satisfactorily explain why there are two invoices for the same work at different prices. There was no record of payment for the work. In these circumstances, I am not satisfied the work outlined in those invoices was performed for a fee. 18. I am satisfied the Landlord has had notice since the time the Tenants took possession of the premises and shortly thereafter of the serious need to perform repairs or replacements with respect to the following matters. Porch Steps and Eaves Trough 19. AbM said the whole left side of the concrete porch stairs are broken and it is that side of the stairs that are needed to enter the house because the entry door is to the left of the centre of the stairs. After the mailman slipped and fell on the porch in December 2017, the Tenant contacted the City of Mississauga on January 30, 2018 regarding the poor state of repair of the porch steps and landing and the inside of the unit. 20. Photographs taken by an inspector from the City of Mississauga show the three concrete front porch steps have deteriorated to the point where they allow water to leak into the cold cellar and room located under the living room of the residential unit. Water pools on the front concrete landing at the top of the steps due to the eaves trough allowing water to spill out onto it. The work needed to fix the concrete porch is estimated by a contractor hired by the Landlord to cost $25,000. 21. As stated, in an email to the Landlord’s rental agent dated May 15, 2016, ArM informed her about the eaves troughs needing cleaning, the washroom drain requiring unclogging and the dishwasher and fireplaces requiring fixing but none of that was ever done. 22. There was no evidence tendered on behalf of the Landlord to contradict the fact that the porch steps, concrete landing and eaves troughs are in serious need of repair. Mould and Water Damage 23. There are two bathrooms on the second floor. The children’s bathroom has problems. A City of Mississauga Inspection Report dated January 19, 2018 states that an inspection revealed, and the photographs attached to the report support, that there are: (a) visible mould on the second-floor bathroom walls, ceiling and floor; missing or broken tiles and floor boards; and no exhaust fan; (b) mould and water damage in main floor living room ceiling; cracks and splits in the drywall which AbM said is due to a leak from the bathtub above; (c) mould visible in the cold room and on the cold room door along with signs of moisture such as the ceiling beams wet and water leaking in from outside front porch area; (d) lots of dead pests on basement floor of cold room; and (e) ceiling damage in laundry room from washroom above and floorboard appeared wet. AbM said it was due to a leak in the toilet above. 24. The City of Mississauga issued an order dated February 14, 2018 requiring the owner to do the following by March 30, 2018 : (A) provide a report from a qualified professional indicating any mould/moisture levels and what remedial action is recommended and where such action is recommended to carry it out in a reasonable time frame; (B) repair and (or) replace the damaged sections of ceiling in the living room and laundry room area; and (C) provide a report from a qualified professional indicating the level of moisture and the point of entry and what remedial action is required to repair the cold room and basement so that they are free from moisture as water is evident on their walls, ceilings and floors and where remedial action is recommended to carry it out in a reasonable time frame. 25. On behalf of the Landlord an estimate dated March 17, 2018 by a numbered company carrying on business as Kleen Condition was presented. It indicates the need for, and estimated cost of, mould remediation and associated repairs in the second-floor bathroom totalling $5,600. With respect to the living room and laundry area, Kleen Condition estimated that to remove and replace damaged sections of drywall ceilings of approximately 32 square feet and remediate the mould to exposed joist and subfloor would cost $3,600. 26. Regarding the cold room, the work required in the interior, including mould remediation of its walls, ceiling and floor, totals $3,600. The estimate for the required remediation work for the basement is $2,750. The removal and disposal of mould debris is estimated to be $1,500. In total the repair and remediation work is estimated to cost $47,516.50 including HST. Water Drains 27. The estimate by Kleen Condition does not appear to address in most instances what remedial action is required so that the damaged areas are free from water. For instance, there is no recommendation with respect to the washroom drains in the second floor bathroom which AbM says are leaking. Dishwasher and Fireplace 28. In addition, there is no response from the Landlord regarding the broken dishwasher and fireplace despite repair of these items having been asked of the Landlord early on in the tenancy. Second Floor Bathroom 29. The landlord has been put on notice that the exhaust vent is ineffective and without that, because the casement windows in the bathroom cannot be opened in the winter, moisture builds up. The Landlord has also been timely informed that tiles are broken in the corner under the window. 30. In addition the tile floor near the tub is broken and boards underneath are exposed. Main Floor Bathroom 31. AbM said the main floor bathroom sink leaks and has been the source of constant complaints to the Landlord. He said the handyman did not repair it and although the Tenants had someone fix it for them twice, still it leaks. 32. In addition, the exhaust fan is old and ineffective. Carpeting on Main Floor 33. The Tenants are waiving their complaint with respect to their having to remove the main floor carpet due to mould as they consider it a form of pay-back for the financial kindness the Landlord extended to the male Tenant. Health 34. ArM suffered from gall stones and had to have her gall bladder removed. The Tenants cat has stopped eating a full meal. The Tenants blame these health problems on the mould allowed to build up in the premises. In the absence of further evidence I cannot find that the existence of mould in the rental unit caused ArM’s gall stones and damage to the gall bladder or the refusal of a thirteen-year-old cat living in the unit to eat a full meal. Here, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that the mould in the rental unit was of a kind and quantity that would produce gall stones and damage a gall bladder and make a cat ill. Thus, the burden of establishing that mould in the rental unit caused ArM’s gall stones and damaged her gall bladder and injured the cat has not been met. Tenants’ Repairs 35. As stated at the hearing the Tenants presented two invoices each dated May 12, 2017for repairs. AbM said the person who provided these invoices is a family member. I am not satisfied these invoices represent work done for the Tenants and paid for by them. Each invoice shows the same work had been done but at different prices. The person who did the work did not testify. Remedy 36. Even if the Tenants did not push the Landlord hard to maintain the rental unit out of fear they would not be able to afford a similarly sized and situated house to rent, I find that the Landlord had adequate notice of the maintenance problems and is in breach of his maintenance obligations undersection 20of theAct resulting in his substantial interference with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit by the Tenants or by a member of their household. 37. The Tenants are asking for rent abatement equal to 66.00 % of the monthly rent of $2,500 for one year which totals $19,800. The lack of proper attention for so long on the part of the Landlord to serious maintenance problems that the Tenants have been obliged to endure and the reliance on clearly inadequate attempts at repairs with respect to some of those problems, in the circumstances, I find, warrant a substantial rent rebate equal to 30% of the rent for 12 months which totals $9,000.00\",\n",
       " \"I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenant is in a significant amount of arrears and, by her own admission, she is not interested in continuing to live at the residential unit. 12. With respect to the Tenant’s contention that she paid her rent for the months of September and October 2016, it was her responsibility to either obtain a receipt from the Landlord or provide some other form of proof of payment, such as a bank withdrawal slip. I cannot accept her word over that of the Landlord in the absence of any supporting documentation. 13. However, I find that the Tenant is entitled to a rent abatement of $1,000.00 for the difficulties that she experienced during the course of the tenancy due to the Landlord’s failure to complete necessary repairs in a timely fashion. I am satisfied that the evidence establishes that the Landlord was not in substantial compliance with his obligation under s. 20 of the Act to maintain the residential unit in a good state of repair. The Landlord’s contention that it completed all of the repairs required by the Bylaw Enforcement Officer’s report in a timely fashion does not appear to be supported by the evidence\",\n",

The Landlord’s Legal Representative was open to the possibility of the Tenant preserving her tenancy if the Tenant can void the L-1 portion of the application as set out in the order and pay her rent on or before the first day of each month for the next twelve months. Determinations: L-1 application/N-4 notice 1. The Tenant has not paid the total rent she was required to pay for the period from December 1, 2016 to February 28, 2017. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective December 19, 2016. 2. The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 3. The monthly rent is $1,252.49. 4. The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed. 5. The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,199.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord. 6. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 1, 2013 to December 19, 2016. 7.

L2 APPLICATION 7. The Landlords claimed the Tenants broke a bedroom window on the second floor. The first-named Landlord submitted a picture of the broken window. The window has two panes of glass and the outside pane was broken. The first-named Landlord stated she believed the Tenants broke the window because the window was not broken until after the Tenants moved in. 8. The Tenants stated they did not know the window was broken. They have a curtain in the window and since the broken pane is on the outside they did not come into contact with it. The Tenants further stated that the first-named Tenant deals with installing windows for a living and he would not have left the window broken had he known of it. 9. On any application before the Board the person making an allegation bears the burden of proof. This means the Landlords must lead sufficient evidence to establish that the Tenants broke the window. Here, the Landlords are basing their allegation on assumption only which means the Landlords have failed to meet their burden of proof. As a result, no remedy will issue\",\n",
       " \"I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until September 30, 2017, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. 5. The Tenant says that he started to withhold his rent because he was confused by the many notices of termination he received. The Tenant also says that he bought a stove for $1,800.00 to replace the allegedly faulty one in his unit and this expense increased his arrears. The Tenant is on a very limited income but he has applied for disability benefits due to his mental health concerns, addiction troubles and physical disabilities. The Tenant is concerned that, if he were to be evicted too soon, he may be homeless and have no place to live. 6. The Tenant is seeking relief in the form of a lengthy 34-month payment plan during which he would pay the monthly rent as well as an additional $100.00. In the alternative, the Tenant is seeking relief from eviction in the form of delay until September 30, 2017, to allow him time to acquire new benefits and attempt to pay off the outstanding arrears, or find a new place to live. 7. The Landlord sympathizes with the Tenant’s position, particularly since he has lived in the rental unit for approximately 10 years. While the Landlord is not agreeable to the 34-month payment plan, the Landlord’s representative does agree that a delay until September 30, 2017, is reasonable, provided that the Tenant be required to pay both August and September’s rent. 8. Based on the evidence before me, I am satisfied that it would not be unfair to delay the eviction until September 30, 2017. This delay should give the Tenant sufficient time to either obtain disability benefits, or find a new place to live. As a result, and in light of the Landlord’s right to receive August and September’s rent, the order will be remedial in nature and will require the Tenant to pay the arrears and any new rent if he wishes to void the order\",\n",

I say this for the following reasons. 19. What is happening here is an unfortunate development for everyone concerned. The Tenants have two young children about 7 and 8 years old. The arrangement between the Tenants prior to marital breakdown was that the second named Tenant would be the primary earner while the first named Tenant attended school. 20. When the Tenants separated the second named Tenant stopped paying rent; the first named Tenant only discovered that fairly recently. 21. He has a part-time job that pays a nominal amount only and no current capacity to pay rent. He has just finished his schooling so could obtain work but he says that when his spouse left she took with him all of his government identification. As an immigrant it is difficult if not impossible to obtain work without proof of permanent residency. He says he has an immigration lawyer helping him obtain replacement identification but he cannot say how long that will take or how long he might expect to continue to be unemployed. 22. Unfortunately the Tenants have not negotiated a separation agreement with respect to the obvious support issues that arise here. 23. The first named Tenant wishes to remain in the unit but if he has to move because of lack of income he wants to be able to stay until the end of the children’s school year. They continue to live in the rental unit and attend school close by. But the child tax credit has not yet been redirected to him. 24. The first named Tenant says his church has been very supportive and they are trying to find the family somewhere else to stay or help out with the rent but nothing has come of that yet. He has $200.00 in his bank account and his family is not in a position to financially assist him. 25. The Landlord’s agent says the unit is a condominium unit owned by a private individual or individuals who are not named as the Landlord in this application. The mortgage is on the verge of going into default and the Tenants have also defaulted on the utilities due under the tenancy agreement. 26. Although I understand why both the Landlord and the second named Tenant seek speedy termination of the tenancy, it seems to me that granting the standard 11 day eviction order requested by the Landlord will render the first named Tenant and two young children homeless just before the end of the school year. That is a hardship that outweighs the financial concerns of the others involved here. That being said, and to try and eliminate some of the prejudice to the Landlord, an order will issue permitting the Landlord to file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) immediately. The Landlord’s agent says such an order will not speed up eviction if the Tenants fail to return vacant possession to the Landlord on or before June 30, 2017. It seems to me that is up to the Sheriff’s office, but an order will also issue directing the Sheriff to expedite enforcement once June 30, 2017 passes. 27.

       " \"In particular, the Landlord’s legal representative submitted the Landlord served the NORI in accordance with section 116 of the Act and it was not disputed the Landlord complied with this provision, which states: 116. (1) A landlord shall not increase the rent charged to a tenant for a rental unit without first giving the tenant at least 90 days written notice of the landlord’s intention to do so. (2) Subsection (1) applies even if the rent charged is increased in accordance with an order under section 126. (3) The notice shall be in a form approved by the Board and shall set out the landlord’s intention to increase the rent and the amount of the new rent. (4) An increase in rent is void if the landlord has not given the notice required by this section, and the landlord must give a new notice before the landlord can take the increase. 12. The Landlord’s legal representative further submitted the Landlord is relying on subsection 119(1) of the Act, which reads as follows: 119. (1) A landlord who is lawfully entitled to increase the rent charged to a tenant for a rental unit may do so only if at least 12 months have elapsed, (a) since the day of the last rent increase for that tenant in that rental unit, if there has been a previous increase; or (b) since the day the rental unit was first rented to that tenant, if clause (a) does not apply. 13. Subsection 194(2) of the Act states: Despite subsection 3(1) and subject to subsection (3), a settlement mediated under this section may contain provisions that contravene any provision under this Act. 14. For the reasons that follow the Landlord is, in my view, permitted to increase the Tenants’ monthly rent in accordance with the NORI served to the Tenants on October 27, 2016. 15. In Crown Trust Co. v. Rosenberg, [1986] O.J. No. 2683 (“Crown Trust”), Galligan J., in considering subsection 2(1) of the Tenant Protection Act, a provision identical to subsection 3(1) of the Act, prohibited contracting out even if it is for the benefit of the tenant.At paragraph 11 Galligan J. states as follows: In attractive and sophisticated arguments, counsel for the landlord contended that the words ‘to the contrary’ in these sections referred to the mischief which the legislation was intended to redress. They contended that the mischief intended to be redressed by both pieces of legislation was the perceived inequality of bargaining power between tenants and landlords. Thus they contended that the parties could effectively agree to terms, which, so long as they increased tenants’ rights, or at least did not impinge upon tenants’ rights, would not be an agreement or waiver to the contrary, as contemplated by s. 82(1). 16. And, further, at paragraphs 14, 15, 16 and 19, as follows: It is my opinion however, that there is no ambiguity in the provisions of ss. 82(1) and 2(1) of the Acts which would entitle me to engage in the exercise of searching out the mischief addressed by the Legislature when it enacted the two pieces of legislation. Indeed the proposition advanced on the landlord’s behalf, when followed to its logical conclusion, proposes that I should rewrite the sections so that they read that the legislative provisions are to apply notwithstanding any agreement or waiver to the contrary, entered into by the tenant. In my opinion, I can do no such thing. I am unable to find anything in either Act that would lead me to think that a landlord can bargain away his statutory rights, but that a tenant cannot. It is interesting to compare ss. 126 and 127 of the Residential Tenancies Act, because very similar language is found in both of them. Section 126 says that where a landlord desires to increase the rent permitted under the statute he may make an application for certain relief. Section 127 says that a tenant who desires to dispute any intended rent increase, may make an application for relief. I don’t think that anyone would suggest that an agreement by a tenant to forgo [sic] his s. 127 rights for a given period of time would be enforceable in the light of s. 2(1) of the Act. I am quite unable to conceive how the rights given to the landlord in the preceding section in very similar language could be treated differently. I have come to the conclusion that the words ‘to the contrary’, when used in the two sections, do not refer to the mischief sought to be redressed by the Legislature, but refer to the application of the legislation. Thus an agreement to the contrary cannot affect the application of Pt. IV of the Landlord and Tenant Act or the application of the Residential Tenancies Act. …While a failure to abide by the terms of the proposed agreements might well be regarded with disfavour, I am of the opinion that to the extent that they conflict with, restrict, waive or modify the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act, they are legally unenforceable. [Emphasis added] 17. I also find the following comments of Killeen J., in Pinheiro v. Bowes, [1994] O.J. No. 115 (“Pinheiro”), helpful: [13] Judges must accept statutes as they find them if they are clear and unambiguous and catch the factual situation under consideration. [14] In my view, while s. 99 was largely created to protect tenants, it cannot be said to be contrary to public policy to enforce it in favour of a landlord. Section 99 provides a broadly-gauged protective rule for landlord-tenant relationships and must be enforced as it plainly reads and provides. On its face, it invalidates the lease proviso in issue and makes the tenant liable for one month’s additional rent. [Emphasis added] 18. Again, considering subsection 2(1) of the Tenant Protection Act, in Barber the majority of the Divisional Court cited Crown Trust and Pinheiro, with approval, and concluded: [17] In the present case, the effect of the so-called agreement on which the tenant seeks to rely would be to forever prohibit the landlord from exercising his right to a rent increase as long as the tenant remained in possession. Because the so-called agreement would amount to a contracting out of the landlord’s right to increase rent in accordance with the TPA, it runs afoul of ss. 2(1) of the statute. While there is provision in the TPA permitting landlords and tenants to negotiate increases and decreases in specific circumstances, none of those circumstances apply here and indeed no provision of the TPA permits a “rent free” agreement. [18] The policy rationale behind ss. 2(1) is to treat tenants and landlords equally. The subsection is designed to prevent parties from bargaining away or waiving their statutory rights no matter what the circumstances. Both Crown Trust Co. v. Rosenberg and Pinheiro v. Bowes found that the provision was meant to operate as a blanket prohibition. To permit a departure would create a significant loophole which could dramatically impair the entire scheme of the Act. [19] The appellant submitted the landlord was estopped from resiling from its bargain. Estoppel cannot override statute (see Harzuz Holdings Ltd. v. Peel (Regional Municipality), [2006] O.J. No. 1830). There is no need for the subsection to make specific reference to the doctrine of estoppel. In any event, it would be illogical to conclude that, although the TPA prohibits in very clear terms any agreement to the contrary or waiver of rights, it leaves open to the parties to accomplish the same thing through the doctrine of estoppel. In any event, the Tribunal does not have the jurisdiction to apply the principle of estoppel in the absence of specific statutory authority (see Klymko v. Lem, [2001] O.J. No. 156). [Emphasis added] 19. Subsection 194(2) of the Act illustrates that the Legislature turned its mind to circumstances where it is permissible to oust the provisions of subsection 3(1) of the Act—that is, where the parties enter into an agreement, which is the product of mediation at the Board, on consent. Here, clearly the facts do not give rise to the application of subsection 194(2). 20. Section 17 of Ontario Regulation 516/06 further illustrates where the Legislature saw fit to exempt parties from the application of the Act. Section 17 outlines payments made by a tenant to a landlord that will not be considered to be illegal fees under s.134 of the Act. Clearly, none of those circumstances apply here. 21. In my view, had the Legislature intended that other circumstances exist, where landlords and tenants could further abrogate their respective statutory rights, such as when negotiating the terms in a lease as is the case here, the Legislature could have, with relative ease, so specified as it did in other provisions of the Act. In this case, the Landlord’s rights impinged upon, and in fact annulled, by the lease are those accorded to him by subsection 119(2) of the Act and, as such, the above-noted term in the parties’ lease alters the law by taking away from the Landlord that which the Act grants. 22. As Killeen J. says, Pinheiro v. Bowes, above, triers of fact must accept statutes as they find them. Moreover, where the provision of a statute is clear and unambiguous, as is the case here with subsection 3(1) of the Act, it should be interpreted according to its ordinary meaning within the broader context of legislative intention, the object of the Act and the scheme of the legislation. 23. The Tenant stated he spoke with some of his friends and clients, who are lawyers, and submitted Barber should be distinguished because that case involved a month-to-month tenancy, which is not the case here. However, there is nothing substantive to distinguish the case at bar from Barber. In Barber, the landlord had given the tenant a letter indicating that the tenant’s rent would be frozen until the tenant decided to vacate the unit. However, the following year the landlord served the tenant with a notice of guideline rent increase. The tenant refused to pay the increase and the landlord applied to the Tribunal for an order for arrears and termination which was granted. The tenant appealed the decision, however it was upheld by Divisional Court. The majority of the Divisional Court held that the landlord was not estopped from increasing the rent despite the letter stating otherwise. 24. Section 1 of the Act states the purposes of the Act include protection from unlawful evictions and a balancing of the rights and responsibilities of residential landlords and tenants. It seems to me entirely inconsistent with one of the stated purposes of the Act, for the Legislature to then, concomitantly, contemplate making it lawful for parties to contract away a right codified in the legislation. This is especially so on a plain reading of subsection 3(1) and in light of the Divisional Court’s pronouncement in Barber, as already noted above, where the majority of the Court stated, in connection with the section in the predecessor legislation identical to subsection 3(1) of the Act, in part: The subsection is designed to prevent parties from bargaining away or waiving their statutory rights no matter what the circumstances. 25. The Court in Barber goes on to find that the provision was meant to operate as a blanket prohibition and, “To permit a departure would create a significant loophole which could dramatically impair the entire scheme of the Act.” 26. And I agree. To uphold the term(s) at issue in the lease would deny the Landlord, for a period of five years, his statutory right to raise the monthly rent in accordance subsection 119(1) of the Act while, simultaneously, amount to a licence for breaches of the Act by the Tenants, when Landlord chooses to exercise his statutory right to lawfully raise the rent. Again, this could not have been the intent of the Legislature. 27. Accordingly, the Landlord was entitled to increase the monthly rent as stipulated in the NORI, served to the Tenants on October 27, 2016, to take effect on February 1, 2017 and increasing the monthly rent from $2,000.00 to $2,040.00. 28. The Tenants have not paid $520.00 of the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from February 1, 2016 to February 28, 2017. The Tenants also owe the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application. 29. The total amount owing is $695.00 ($520.00 + $175.00). 30. The Landlord requested a standard order, according the Tenants eleven days to pay the total amount outstanding and continue the tenancy. 31. The Tenant requested a payment plan, whereby the Tenants would satisfy their arrears debt to the Landlord over a period of six months as the Tenants are on a fixed income. The Tenant explained he works part-time and his spouse does not work. The Tenant stated the Tenants’ gross monthly income is approximately $5,000.00. 32. I asked the Landlord’s legal representative for submissions going to section 83 relief and he stated he did not have anything further to add. No evidence was presented the parties have, in the past come before the Board on any issues arising out of the tenancy. Indeed, the Tenants’ uncontradicted evidence is the monthly rent, in the amount they believed to be the lawful rent, that is $2,000.00, was invariably paid in full and on time since the outset of the tenancy. 33. Having considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), I find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act\",\n",

The Landlord incurred charges of $60.00 for administration charges related to cheques tendered by or on behalf of the Tenant, which were returned NSF. The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $2,000.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord. 7.

WL requested a payment plan that would allow him to pay the arrears over time. He proposed paying the Landlord $100.00/month towards the arrears in addition to his rent. However, I find that this (or any) payment plan would not be appropriate in this situation. WL testified that he does not know where ED is currently living. Therefore, even though the Tenants are jointly responsible pay paying the arrears, it may fall on WL to do so alone. WL testified that his monthly income is $3,100.00 and his expenses are $1,000.00 in addition to the rent for a total of $2,840.00. Even if I accept the Tenant’s testimony about his financial situation without any documentation to corroborate it, I find that WL would barely be able to make the $100.00 monthly payments he proposed. Further, based on this payment plan, it would take WL (or the Tenants together) approximately 80 months to pay off the arrears. I do not think this is a fair or realistic plan for either party. Therefore, I find that conditional relief is not appropriate. 9. I am also not satisfied that relief from eviction is appropriate because the evidence suggests that WL cannot afford to pay the monthly rent. According to the application, which WL did not dispute, he paid $700.00 towards the rent in October, 2018, which is $20.00 short of half and he did not pay any rent in November, 2018. When WL was asked why he did not pay rent in November he testified that he had additional expenses that month, specifically winter clothes. Without any documentation before me to corroborate WL’s income, I am left to find that either WL did not prioritize his rent appropriately or the financial information he provided in his testimony is incorrect. There was no evidence before me regarding ED’s financial situation so I am unable to determine whether he can afford to pay some or all of the rent. 10. WL testified that if the application was granted, he would need 1-3 months to move out. By the time this order becomes enforceable, WL will have had a month to find alternative accommodations. I do not think it is reasonable to continue the tenancy any further and risk having the arrears continue to increase\",\n",

He also noted the presence of feces in the corners of the living areas and assumed these to have been deposited by unseen pets. 12.

The flooring throughout the rental unit was severely stained and damaged and requires replacement. This includes both the laminate and carpeted areas, the latter of which was severely stained by animal urine. At the hearing, the Landlord’s Legal Representative submitted a quote from The Carpet Place for $3,829.57 to supply and install new carpeting throughout the unit. c. The seals on the patio door had been destroyed. As the door was a one-piece item, the entire door requires replacement. d. As noted above, the refrigerator and chest freezer will need to be replaced due to excessively foul-smelling decomposition of abandoned food. As the Tenants had allowed the hydro service to be disconnected, there was no power to these appliances. As well, one of the refrigerator drawers was missing. e. An interior door had been forcibly removed and left outside the rental unit. f.

However, I am not satisfied that it would be unfair to the Landlord to give the Tenant until April 30, 2018, to find alternate accommodation on condition that the Tenant pays $600.00 on or before Monday, March 26, 2018, and pays the rent for April on April 1, 2018. The Tenant was adamant that he was about to receive funds that would allow him to make those payments. In reaching this decision I have considered the fact that the Tenant has a brain injury of which the Landlord must have been aware and the Landlord failed to provide the Tenant with receipts for rental payments\",\n",

The Landlord asserted he is seeking termination of the tenancy. Given that the Tenant has been in the rental unit for a long time, and a previous “pay on time” order was successful, I asked the Landlord why he felt another similar order would not be appropriate in these circumstances, if the Tenant repaid the outstanding arrears prior to the termination date. The Landlord testified that it has been financially and administratively challenging to deal with the Tenant’s persistent late rent payments. In addition, the Tenant has stopped communicating with the Landlord. The Landlord has sent emails and text messages to the Tenant, and has not received any reply. The Landlord has also dropped by the rental unit on two occasions with the intent of speaking with the Tenant, but even though the Tenant’s vehicle was there, the Tenant did not answer his door. In the absence of submissions from the Tenant, and considering the negative impact the Tenant’s actions have had on the Landlord, I am satisfied that it would be unfair to the Landlord to allow the tenancy to continue\",\n",

The T2 Application 11. According to the Tenant’s description of this issue in the T2 Application and the evidence submitted at the hearing, the problem related to a maintenance issue with the hot water heater rather than a situation in which the Landlord or its agent withheld hot water from the Tenant or wilfully interfered with its supply. 12. As a result, I find that the Tenant should have included this issue under the T6 Application rather than under the present T2 Application. As the Act provides different remedies with regard to a maintenance application compared to a T2 Application, the forms are not interchangeable. 13. Since the Landlord received notice that the Tenant intended to raise this issue at the hearing, the matter of the hot water heater has been addressed below under the proper T6 Application. 14. Therefore, I do not find that the Landlord, the Landlord's superintendent or the Landlord's agent withheld a reasonable supply of a vital service, care service, or food that the Landlord was obligated to supply under the tenancy agreement or deliberately interfered with the reasonable supply of vital service, care service, or food. The T6 Application – Water Leaks and the Kitchen Sink 15. The Tenant testified that she discovered that the kitchen sink was leaking when she moved into the rental unit on July 21, 2017. The sink is located on a kitchen island with cabinets. She notified the Landlord of these issues on August 20, 2017 and around the same time, she also discovered a maggot infestation that appeared to originate from under the kitchen island. On or about September 14, 2017, A.A.’s husband, O.A., attended at the rental unit to investigate and conduct repairs. She stated that he removed the sink and cupboards, but promised to return the next day to complete the work. However, this did not occur. Removal of the sink did not resolve the underlying leak issue. 16. At the hearing, she submitted photographs of the flooring that had been under the moved kitchen island, showing a considerable amount of food and other debris accumulated in this area. Other images show several maggots moving along what appears to be a baseboard or some other surface in the rental unit. She recalled that these photographs were taken at some point in September, 2017. She testified that in October, 2017, she discovered the remains of a one kilogram bag of dog food under the baseboards under the island. This and other garbage wedged into the flooring apparently provided a food source for the maggots. 17. She testified that O.A. did not return for five months and the issue was only resolved when she replaced the cabinetry at her own expense. She submitted a receipt from B.B., her own contractor. This document indicated that he installed kitchen cabinets, a new countertop, sink and faucet and completed all associated electrical plumbing and electrical work. He also installed a new dishwasher. The total that B.B. charged for this work was $600.00. The receipt indicated that the Tenant had paid $125.00 of this amount as of February 22, 2018, leaving a balance of $475.00 outstanding. The Tenant testified that she ultimately paid the full balance as A.A. refused to pay on the grounds that she had not authorized the work. 18. B.B. has known the Tenant for approximately twenty years. He has approximately twelve years’ experience in carpentry and related trades. He testified that A.A. sent him to pick up a new kitchen cabinet at Habitat for Humanity (‘Habitat’) for the rental unit at some point in February, 2018 and advised him that she had a credit with that agency. When he attended at Habitat, he discovered that no such credit was on file. Habitat also had no cabinet set aside for the Landlord as she had claimed. He testified that despite an agreement with A.A., A.A. only paid $125.00 of his $600.00 invoice for the work completed in the rental unit; he confirmed that the Tenant paid the balance. He ultimately obtained the cabinets for the rental unit at Habitat, but emphasized that these were not owned or set aside by the Landlord. 19. B.B. also confirmed that the state of the Tenant’s kitchen was “deplorable” and that she was using cutlery stored in boxes for meals as there was no usable kitchen in the residence. 20. The Tenant testified that she was understandably anxious over the presence of maggots in the rental unit. 21. While she waited on repairs to her kitchen and now removed sink, the Tenant was compelled to wash her dishes in the bathroom sink and tub, as confirmed by photographs submitted at the hearing. She testified that the kitchen island and leak issues were eventually resolved in early January, 2018. 22. A.A. did not dispute the Tenant’s evidence of the leak or the ensuing maggots in the kitchen, but emphasized that she opened up the part of the floor where they were discovered and waited one day to confirm that the problem had been resolved. I agree with A.A. that there was no logic in replacing the cabinetry until the maggots had been eradicated. However, on the evidence, she appears to have taken no further steps in September, 2017 to confirm that the problem was fully resolved when the Tenant did not advise her whether or not there were still maggots in the kitchen. 23. With respect to a serious health issue such as vermin in the rental unit, I find that it was incumbent on the Landlord to take proactive measures to confirm that these pests have been fully exterminated. 24. For this reason, I find that the Landlord should have entered the rental unit to resolve this issue as soon as possible. While A.A.’s consideration of the Tenant’s privacy while her mother was hospitalized is laudable, the parties agreed that the Tenant was absent from the rental unit for much of October, 2017. During that period, the Landlord could have easily completed the necessary repairs to the kitchen island in the Tenant’s absence with minimal disruption to her enjoyment of the residence. 25. As a result, I do not find that the Landlord resolved this issue in an appropriately timely manner and therefore breached its duties under subsection 20(1) of the Act for providing and maintaining a residential complex, including the rental units in it, in a good state of repair and fit for habitation and for complying with health, safety, housing and maintenance standards. 26. As I find that the Landlord’s breach caused substantial disruption to the Tenant’s ability to normally reside in the rental unit and significantly impinged on her use and enjoyment of the residence, I find that the Tenant is entitled to an abatement of rent structured as follows: a. Loss of use of the kitchen sink from August 20, 2017 to January 1, 2018 at 15% ($697.15); b. Loss of the kitchen island from September 14, 2017 to January 31, 2018 at 5% ($237.62); c. Maggot infestation in rental unit for one month at 50% ($525.00). 27. Since neither the Tenant nor B.B. were particularly specific in their recollections of dates, I have selected the narrowest ranges of dates provided in their evidence at the hearing as the most reliable evidence. This remedy is intended to include compensation for the stress suffered by the Tenant as a result of the Landlord’s delay in restoring her kitchen. 28. While the Tenant also requested compensation for her out of pocket expenses incurred to pay B.B. for his renovation work, the evidence indicated that the Tenant was not authorized to replace the dishwasher in the rental unit and did not lead evidence to suggest that this work related to a maintenance breach properly brought to the Landlord’s attention, let alone included as a cause of action in either application. As B.B.’s invoice failed to itemize the cost of the replacement cabinetry separate from the unauthorized upgrades, it is not possible to order compensation for the eligible items alone. As a result, this compensation will not be ordered. 29. Lastly, the Tenant requested an award of $500.00 in “non-pecuniary damages” based upon the stress she endured while the Landlord’s delayed repairing the issues in the rental unit. The Tenant most likely seeks an award of general damages pursuant to paragraph (9) of subsection 30(1) of the Act. As I noted above, the ordered abatement is intended to address the emotional consequences of the Landlord’s conduct. 30. As well, the threshold for imposing general damages would require extremely egregious conduct on the part of the Landlord. The leading authority on this issue is the Ontario Divisional Court’s analysis in Mejia v. Cagini.[1] In that case, an unquestionably toxic relationship between the parties culminated in an assault upon the tenant by three friends of the landlord, in the landlord’s presence. The Ontario Rental Housing Tribunal found the assault took place in the presence of the tenant’s family and that its purpose was to put pressure upon the tenant to vacate the premises. The tenant was required to attend hospital for treatment. The Tribunal did not find that the landlord had himself committed the assault, but found that he did nothing to stop it and that he was responsible for the actions of his friends. The Tribunal found that the landlord had thereby interfered with the reasonable use and enjoyment of the apartment by the tenant and his family and awarded general damages. 31. In light of all of the circumstances, I do not find that the Landlord’s conduct in the present case rises to the level of seriousness that would warrant an order of general damages apart from the ordered abatement. The Hot Water Heater 32. The Tenant testified that whenever it rains, the basement tends to flood. She offered no other details on the amount of water in the basement or its effect on her use of the space. However, between August 28 and August 29, 2017, the Windsor area received substantial rainfall, resulting in flooding of many homes, including this rental unit. The Tenant stated that she “lost everything in the flood” and that her washer and dryer as well as the hot water heater were immersed in over one foot of water. 33. The Landlord did not replace the heater for four weeks. In the interim, the Tenant states that she was forced to wash her laundry elsewhere, taking cabs about the city. While she described this out of pocket expense as “cabs were killer,” she did not explain why she was unable to use a more economical method of public transit. Although A.A. did not contest the Tenant’s evidence that the hot water heater was not repaired for four weeks, the Tenant did not offer any explanation why her laundry could not have been washed with cold water as she did not suggest that the washing machine was disabled by the flood. Although she estimated the total cost of commuting through Windsor to attend commercial laundries at $300.00, she was unable to substantiate this estimate with any receipts or other documentation at the hearing. 34. However, the Tenant acknowledged that she waited for two or three days before notifying A.A. of the flood in her basement as she presumed that A.A. must know that the house was affected. This necessarily delayed resolution of the issue and may have caused irreparable damage to the heater that could have been prevented had the Tenant contacted A.A. more promptly. 35. While the Tenant testified about high hydro bills and the Landlord’s slow and allegedly inadequate cleaning of the basement, as these issues were not mentioned in the applications, the Tenant denied the Landlord reasonable notice that she intended to raise these issues at the hearing. As a result, these issues will form no part of the order to follow other than as context for the deteriorating relationship between the parties. 36. A.A. testified that as soon as she was notified of the water in the basement, she attended at the rental unit. She attempted to contact a restoration company; however, as much of Windsor had been affected by severe flooding, none were available in short order. 37. However, when she and O.A. attended at the rental unit to inspect the damage, the Tenant’s boyfriend told them not to worry about the basement and that he would take care of it. While the Tenant was reluctant to allow A.A. to enter the rental unit or to assist her with cleaning the basement, A.A. insisted on addressing the issue as soon as possible to avoid further damage. She testified that she was able to remove most of the Tenant’s property from the affected area and cleaned approximately half of the basement. 38. In her own testimony, the Tenant expressed dissatisfaction with the assistance offered by A.A. and her husband, more in relation to the speed of their efforts. As she put it, they “moved like turtles.” 39. Despite numerous hisses and gasps of derision, the Tenant did not substantively contest A.A.’s testimony that her boyfriend largely commandeered the repairs to the basement, insisting on various supplies and interfering with the efforts of the Landlord’s contractors to replace the tank. This version of events was confirmed by a letter from E.P., A.A.’s regular contractor stating that when he initially attended at the rental unit to complete the work, the Tenant’s boyfriend interfered with his efforts and insisted that he complete the work himself. To that end, the boyfriend gave A.A. a lengthy list of materials that a later electrician deemed unnecessary and serving only to waste time. 40. Unlike the issues in the kitchen, the evidence with respect to the delay in replacing the water heater includes a significant element of interference by the Tenant and her boyfriend despite the Landlord’s concerted efforts to resolve the issue. As well, particular circumstances related to the widespread flooding of basements throughout the city at the time hampered A.A.’s reasonable access to remediation that could have been more readily available at other times. 41. Putting aside the Tenant’s failure to request a remedy for the items allegedly damaged in the basement by the flood itself, she also failed to demonstrate that the Landlord could have reasonably anticipated this event. In McQuestion v. Schneider, the Ontario Court of Appeal held that liability for injuries or damages could not be imposed on a landlord who had no knowledge or could not reasonably be expected to have knowledge of a maintenance problem.[2] The Court held that then subsection 96(1) of the Landlord and Tenant Act (now subsection 20(1) of the Act): … does not impose an absolute liability upon a landlord for any injuries or damages that may be caused by a latent defect, of which the landlord has no knowledge, nor could reasonably be expected to have had such knowledge. To alter the law so drastically as to impose strict liability on a landlord, regardless of his knowledge or constructive knowledge, would require much more precise language.[3] 42. In light of the all of evidence at the hearing, I find that the extreme flooding in August, 2017 was not reasonably foreseeable. While the Tenant testified that the basement was subject to occasional wetness, on the evidence, the sheer volume of water entering the rental unit in the last days of August, 2017 was unexpected and unforeseeable. There was also no evidence that the Tenant had even notified the Landlord of the more minor moisture issues in the rental unit. As a result, I do not find that the Landlord failed to meet its maintenance obligations under subsection 20(1) of the Act with respect to the initial flooding. As a result, the Landlord cannot be held liable for the Tenant’s initial losses caused by the flood itself. 43. In Onyskiw v. CJM Property Management Ltd. the Ontario Court of Appeal rejected a long-standing presumption that a landlord may be deemed immediately in breach of subsection 20(1) of the Act once a defect arises: 58. If the legislature intended an automatic breach of the landlord’s duty to maintain and repair as soon as a service was interrupted, there would be no need for the Board to make a determination as to whether the landlord had breached its obligation. The legislation would instead simply provide that where a service has been interrupted the landlord is in breach of its duty to maintain and repair and provide that the Board “may” award a remedy under s. 30(1) which authorizes a range of remedies including an abatement of rent. 59. The tenants’ position that the landlord is automatically in breach of its statutory obligation to maintain and repair even while something is being repaired also offends the legal maximlex non cogit ad impossibilia:that the legislature does not intend compliance where, for all practical purposes, it is impossible: see Côté,The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada, at p. 479. 60. Applying general principles of statutory interpretation, I would reject the tenants’ submission that, when the RTA is properly interpreted, a landlord is automatically in breach of its obligation to repair and maintain under s. 20(1) as soon as an interruption in service occurs.[4] 44. The prior leading authority on this issue was the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in Pajelle Investments Ltd. v. Herbold.[5] However, as the Court in Onyskiw held, in light of the evolution in the law in the decades since that case was decided, Pajelle also stands for the principle that a contextual approach is necessary when considering whether the landlord responded appropriately to a maintenance defect. Such a reading is appropriate having regard to the interpretive principle that legislation enacted to regulate an activity that is ongoing over an extended period of time invites a dynamic, as opposed to a fixed, interpretation.[6] 45. This contextual approach is also consistent with the Board’s Interpretation Guideline 5, which states as follows: If a landlord has done little maintenance for an extended period, and a serious condition results that takes some time to rectify, the landlord should be responsible for the tenants’ loss of use of their unit or the common facilities during the repairs. However, if the landlord has a reasonable program of maintenance, including preventative maintenance, and is acting responsibly to rectify a problem that requires extensive repairs, an abatement of rent should not be ordered. 46. The Tenant’s Agent relied upon an earlier decision of the Landlord and Tenant Board (the ‘Board’), CET-29301-14, issued on March 26, 2013. While past decisions of the Board are not binding on me, it is worth noting that this order predates Onyskiw. In CET-29301-13, the Member relied upon the now outdated contractual analysis of Offredi v. 751768 Ontario Ltd.[7] As a result, I find that this case is of no assistance. 47. Following the analysis in Onyskiw, I find that since the Landlord demonstrated a proactive program of maintenance and acted responsibly and in a very timely manner to resolve the Tenant’s concerns and was obstructed by the unreasonable actions of the Tenant’s boyfriend, it was not in breach of its responsibilities under subsection 20(1) of the Act with respect to the water heater. Other Issues 48. The tenancy agreement was signed by the Tenant and A.A. on July 20, 2017. On the second page of the contract, the parties agreed to the following additional conditions: Landlord agrees to supply the following: Screens (2) More Cupboards and Counter top for the kitchen. 1 window already ordered for the rear bedroom. Storm door (longer) 49. Both the Tenant and A.A. signed below this addendum. The Tenant acknowledged that the Landlord has replaced one double pane window. 50. However, none of these issues, or another problem with a door, were mentioned in either application. As a result, the Tenant failed to provide the Landlord with reasonable notice that she intended to raise these issues at the hearing. Consequently, these issues will form no part of the order to follow. 51. This order contains all of the reasons in this matter and no further reasons will issue\",\n",

I am satisfied that there have been some repair issues, as evidenced by the fact that the Landlord did do some work in response to the contact with the building department. However, the neither party was prepared to address those issues on the day of the hearing.

The L2 Application: 7. I have considered the totality of the Landlord’s evidence including the oral testimony of his current tenant, ST and a prior tenant, LG as well as the documents provided to the Board. I find on a balance of probabilities that the Landlord did not establish the allegations made in the Notice to End Your Tenancy for Interfering with Others, Damages or Overcrowding (N5) or the Notice to Terminate a Tenancy Early Illegal Act or Misrepresentation of Income (N6) and as a result termination of the tenancy is not warranted on this basis. 8. I have no doubt that the Landlord believes the allegations made in the notices provided to the Tenant and I have no doubt that the Tenant is smoking in the rental unit. However, the Landlords conclusion that the Tenant is smoking marijuana is based on a subjective interpretation of the smell of smoke and is not corroborated by any objective third party. 9. It is not clear to me that the smell of smoke, even if it is marijuana, is not coming from an open window or other entry to the residential complex. This is because the Landlord did not perform an inspection which found that marijuana was being smoked in the rental unit, and relied only on the smell throughout the building. 10. LG and ST testified that they often smelled what they believed to be smoke originating from the burning of marijuana. However, neither could state with certainty that the smell couldn’t be something else. 11. LG refused to move in to the upstairs rental unit as a result of the strong smell of smoke, but LG admitted that she never observed the Tenant smoking any substance within the residential complex. 12. ST testified that both cannabis and cigarette smoke were smelled within the complex “coming up through the vent” from the basement apartment. However, ST also admitted that, she could not verify the odours were caused by the Tenant, and did not observe the Tenant smoking any substance in the rental unit. 13. The Landlord also testified at this hearing. The Landlord stated that his wife and son told him the odour allegedly emanating from the basement unit was cannabis. This is second hand information and I did not consider it persuasive as a result. That is, the Landlord was unable to identify the smell personally and therefore cannot comment on the cause of the smell with clarity or certainty. I find this evidence insufficient to conclude on a balance of probabilities that the Tenant engaged in an illegal act in the residential complex. Therefore, the portion of the L2 application attributable to the N6 is dismissed. 14. Similarly, the Landlord sought to terminate the tenancy for substantial interference with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex as it relates to the other tenants surrounding this rental unit. Again, the evidence provided was insufficient in my view to determine that the Tenant was smoking marijuana in the rental unit and therefore, insufficient to conclude that the Tenant substantially interfered with the other tenants’ reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex. 15. The tenancy agreement between the Landlord and the Tenant does not prohibit smoking. Therefore, the fact that the Tenant likely smoked some substance in this rental unit is not sufficient grounds to terminate the tenancy in my view. As a result, the balance of the L2 application is also dismissed\",\n",

The Landlord submitted an email exchange between the Landlord’s Legal Representative and the Tenant, in which the Tenant agrees to a conditional order terminating the tenancy on a non-voidable basis on September 19, 2018, provided the Tenant repay the arrears in a payment plan set out in the email, pays her ongoing rent on time, and does not repeat any of the behaviours listed in the N5 notices (Exhibit # 2). The Landlord’s Legal Representative stated that the Landlord wanted to pursue an order with these terms, with the consent of the Tenant. 25. As the Tenant was not present to testify, I cannot simply order these terms on consent of both parties. However, since the Landlord proved his allegations about non-payment of rent, persistent late payment of rent, and substantial interference with the reasonable enjoyment of the Landlord and other residents at the residential complex, the Landlord is entitled to seek an order for repayment of the arrears and a non-voidable termination of the tenancy effective 11 days from the date of this order. The Landlord’s proposed plan allows for a significant delay in the eviction date, provided the Tenant makes the payments as set out below and abides by the conduct conditions.

I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. The Landlord advised that if the Tenant pays the arears to void the Application to Evict a Tenant for Non-payment of Rent and to Collect the Rent the Tenant Owes (L1), she would be satisfied with a conditional order allowing the tenancy to continue on condition that the Tenant pays the rent on time for the next 12 months\",\n",
       " \"I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until August 31, 2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. While I considered denying the eviction on the condition that the Tenant pay her rent of time for a year, ultimately I do not think that would be fair to the Landlord, as I am not convinced the Tenant will be able to make her rent payments on time until her financial situation stabilizes when her child tax benefit issues are resolved, which the Tenant stated could be as late as October 2018. However in consideration of the Tenant’s status as a single parent, and given that she has not yet made alternate housing arrangements, I find it would not be unfair to give the Tenant a few more weeks to find another place to live in time to enroll her son in school\",\n",
       " \"I must determine exactly when the Act began to apply to this tenancy. The Landlord testified that he moved out of the rental unit in January 2018, while the Tenant insisted he moved out in December 2017. With no other supporting evidence, I find the Landlord vacated on or before December 31, 2017, as the Landlord testified he turned the gas to the stove off sometime before January 1, 2018. 23. Therefore, I find the Act applies to this tenancy as of January 1, 2018, and the Board has jurisdiction to hear and make determinations on the Landlord’s application for rent arrears. Landlord’s L1 Application for Arrears of Rent 24. The N4 Notice of Termination claims rent for December 2017 through April 2018. The notice clearly sets out that over that period of time, the Tenant was charged $500 per month in rent, and made no payments. I have found the Act did not apply to the tenancy for the month of December 2017. As this is a very unique situation and only as of this order are the parties aware of the application of the Act to this tenancy, I do not consider the inclusion of December rent arrears on the N4 notice a fatal error that invalidates the notice. The notice otherwise substantially complies with the Act and is not confusing. It accurately sets out how much rent the Tenant was require to pay and the amount he paid the Landlord. Therefore, I find the Landlord was entitled to file his application for repayment of arrears and eviction of the Tenant. 25. The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from January 1, 2018 to July 31, 2018. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective May 14, 2018. 26. The Landlord’s claim for $500 in rent arrears for December 2017 is denied, as I have found the Act did not apply to the rental unit until January 2018 and the Board does not have jurisdiction to award these arrears. 27. The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 28. The monthly rent is $500.00 29. The Landlord is not holding a last month's rent deposit. 30. The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed. Tenants’ Rights Issue – Discontinuance in Services at the Rental Unit: 31. Section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (‘the Act’) allows Tenants to raise any issue that could be the subject of a tenant application tenant under the Act. In this case, the parties agreed that the Landlord took the washing machine and dryer with him when he vacated the rental unit. The Landlord has not replaced the laundry facilities. In the absence of laundry facilities, the Tenant has resorted to doing his laundry in the sink. 32. The parties also agreed that the Landlord turned off the gas to the only stove in the house The Landlord asserted that the Tenant only ever microwaved his food, so he didn’t think the Tenant would need the gas stove. The Tenant asserted that he has been incurring extra costs for take-out meals because he can’t use the stove to cook. At the hearing, the Landlord agreed to immediately turn the gas for the stove back on. 33. Section 130 of the Act sets out that a tenant of a rental unit may apply to the Board for an order for a reduction of the rent charged for the rental unit due to a reduction or discontinuance in services or facilities provided in respect of the rental unit or the residential complex. 34. In this case, I find that by removing the laundry facilities and shutting off the gas to the stove in January 2018, the Landlord discontinued two of the services that were previously provided to the Tenant as part of the rental arrangement. Therefore, I find that the Tenant is entitled to a rebate of rent of $200.00 per month for the months of January to July 2018; a total rebate of $1,400.00. This amount shall be applied to the rent arrears owing by the Tenant. 35. Assuming the Landlord has turned the gas to the stove back on as he promised during the hearing, the rent will be reduced by $100.00 per month starting August 2018 on an ongoing basis until laundry facilities are returned to the rental unit. If the Landlord has not turned the gas to the stove back on by July 31, 2018, the rent will be reduced by a further $100.00 per month starting August 2018 on an ongoing basis until the gas to the stove is turned back on. 36. The Tenant also asserted that he did not have a key to one of the doors in the rental unit from January to June 2018, that the Landlord interfered in the Tenant’s relationship with his daughter, and that the Tenant “had to” take care of lawn and snow maintenance at the rental unit. The Tenant did not prove that the Landlord was responsible for these issues, so these claims are denied. The Tenant also had claims about the Landlord’s conduct, including moving all the Tenant’s belongings when staging the house for sale. However, as this alleged conduct occurred prior to January 1, 2018, the rental unit was exempt from the Act at the time and the Board has no jurisdiction to consider this claim. 37. As the partially successful applicant, the Landlord is entitled to the application filing fee. Relief from Eviction 38. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until August 31, 2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. 39. The Landlord supports his spouse and infant child, and has suffered financial pressure since the Tenant stopped paying rent. The Landlord is financing two homes at this time. On the other hand, the Tenant is in his eighties, and has no support from his family because in the Tenant’s words, he would never ask them for help. The Tenant has lived in the rental unit for many years, and is clearly struggling with the concept that he may have to vacate the rental unit. I find it would not be unfair to extend the termination date to August 31, 2018, to allow the Tenant more time to come up with the rent arrears, or failing that, to allow the Tenant to pack his belongings and find another place to live. 40. This order contains all of the reasons for this matter, and no other reasons will issue\",\n",

The L2 Application 8. The Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due. Specifically, the rental ledger submitted at the hearing confirmed that since September, 2017, the Tenant has consistently failed to pay the monthly rent in full and on or before the first day of the month when it was due. The Tenant’s payment history during this period consists of partial payments and payments made well after the first of the month. As of the present hearing, the Tenant remained in arrears of rent. 9. As a result, the Landlord’s application for termination of the tenancy at the end of the term of the tenancy on the basis of persistent late payment is allowed. 10. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, including the request of the Landlord’s Legal Representative, and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. 11.

The Tenant said that the reason she had not paid her rent some months was because her rent was stolen and because she felt bullied by the exterminator and thought she was being evicted, she had put deposits on other premises but she had not secured them. She proposed to pay the arrears by a pay plan of $75.00 per month. Since that would take 22 months, I am not satisfied that it would be fair to the Landlord to grant the Tenant’s request. However, since the Landlord is holding a last month's rent deposit, I am not satisfied that it would be unfair to the Landlord to allow the Tenant a short extension until August 15, 2018, to either pay the arrears and costs or vacate\",\n",

The Tenant has had an interruption in her social assistance and then was involved in a motor vehicle collision which interfered with her ability to consult with her worker to arrange to be re-instated. As a result, she has only paid rent one month in the last 5. She did not look for alternate housing because she spoke with the Landlord early in August and understood from that discussion that the Landlord would be willing to negotiate a payment plan. The Landlord’s Legal Representative was unwilling to negotiate a payment plan because the parties had previously entered into a mediated agreement with respect to arrears and as soon as the mediated agreement was satisfied the Tenant stopped paying her rent. I am satisfied that it would not be unfair to the Landlord to give the Tenant some time to find alternate accommodation based on the Tenant’s promise to pay $900.00 on each of September 7, and September 20 and October 1, 2018, and to leave October 31, 2018.

The Landlord’s Counsel acknowledged that the eviction provisions in the L1 Application would be redundant should the Landlord enforce the eviction ordered by order SWL-19968-18, dated August 8, 2018. However, he stated a preference to maintain termination provisions in both orders out of an abundance of caution, given the highly contentious relationship between the parties. It should be noted that once the stay of order SWL-19968-18 has been lifted, the voiding options included in the L1 Application at paragraphs 8 and 9 of the order below would be rendered unenforceable. The Tenants’ Set Aside Motion 25. There was no dispute at the hearing that the parties signed the N11 Agreement on July 9, 2018 (the ‘N11 Agreement’) with a termination date of July 29, 2018 and that the Tenants did not vacate the rental unit on or before that date. 26. However, B.M. testified that he signed the N11 Agreement under duress and took the position that the Landlord and Tenant Board (the ‘Board’) should therefore set aside order SWL-19968-18, issued on August 8, 2018. Specifically, his written statement filed in support of the motion read as follows: The Landlord trapped me in forceable [sic] confinment [sic] and threatened me to sign a termination aggrement; [sic] I went striaght [sic] to the police and made and doccumented [sic] the harrassment [sic] in a police report with charges pending, the officer told him the L2 was null and void I have a police report the order is null and void [sic] 27. Significantly, the above statement was signed by only B.M. and not A.J.Y. As noted above, A.J.Y. did not attend the hearing or submit any statement to the Board recounting his own version of events. However, T.W. and B.M. largely agreed that A.J.Y. is significantly less assertive compared to B.M. and is to some extent subservient to his will. 28. By way of background, the tenancy commenced on May 1, 2018. Term 7 of the tenancy agreement, signed by the parties on April 28, 2018, assigns responsibility for payment of utilities to the Tenants: 7. Utilities to be paid by the Tenant(s) are electricity, water, sewage, and garbage removal. Any other services/utilities such as cable, telephone, and internet are the responsibility of the Tenant(s) to arrange and pay for. 29. B.M. testified that on June 22, 2018, T.W. attended at the rental unit to collect payment for an unpaid hydro bill. B.M. objected to his presence in the common areas of the residential complex, preferring T.W. to contact him first before approaching the rental unit. When B.M. answered the door, T.W. showed him a bill in T.W.’s name and demanded payment. B.M. informed him that he only had funds to pay the rent due in a few days. He testified that T.W. then reached through the door and tried to grab him by the shoulders, apparently intending to drag him from the unit and down the stairs. He stated that T.W. said, “I’ll take you to the fucking bank right now to pay this bill” and “blah, blah, blah.” He emphasized the accuracy of the latter quote later in the hearing. 30. Under cross-examination, B.M. reluctantly acknowledged that T.W. did not actually make contact with him when he reached through the doorway, but attributed this not to any shortage of violent intent on T.W.’s part, but to his own preternaturally cat-like reflexes as a professional skate boarder that allowed him to move quickly out of T.W.’s reach. 31. B.M. testified that he informed T.W. that he was assaulting him and stated that he was going to call the police immediately. He shut the door, but this did not deter T.W., who continued to stalk about outside the door, angrily threatening to evict the Tenants. B.M. stated that he was “so scared” and said, “Look man, settle down” and slid the requested funds under the door, pleading for T.W. to leave or he would call the police. 32. He told T.W. that because he took the hydro money, he was no longer responsible for payment of the rent for July, 2018. He told T.W. that he would be short on the upcoming rent and T.W. would have to wait until July 3, 2018 when B.M. was next paid. He took the position that this would be T.W.’s fault since he “stole” the hydro money. He stated that T.W. told him “that won’t do.” B.M. then advised T.W. that their relationship was now terminated due to T.W.’s conduct. B.M. stated that T.W. then presented him with the N11 Agreement. Needing to get to work and unable to “handle any of that crap,” B.M. initially refused to sign as he was an ideal tenant. However, according to B.M., since T.W. had B.M. cornered in the rental, he was “forced” to sign the N11 Agreement in order to escape and go to work. Eventually, T.W. left and B.M. was able to exit the rental unit. 33. However, he stated that T.W. then chased him while he tried to flee the premises in his car. He said that T.W. reached into the car, impeding B.M.’s ability to drive as both grappled for control of the vehicle. As B.M. noted, “This pissed me off” and he attended at the “cop shop” to disclose the T.W.’s “heinous crimes” and “savagery.” Why T.W. would have chased B.M. after had already obtained his signature on the N11 Agreement was not clarified. 34. Later, when A.J.Y. alleged that T.W. had been peeping through the window at him, B.M.’s anger built up. He stated that he has since refused to pay any further rent to the Landlord. As noted above, he blamed T.W. for the loss of his job, but did not explain how this occurred. B.M.’s account of these events also does not explain how the N11 Agreement came to be signed and dated by both Tenants on July 9, 2018, not June 22, 2018, despite his testimony that he alone signed the form when T.W. coerced his cooperation during the harrowing encounter on the earlier date. 35. B.M. testified that the police investigated his allegations by attending at T.W.’s residence and ordered him not to harass the Tenants. Although T.W. agreed that the police spoke with him, they simply recorded his version of events and did not take either party’s side in the conflict. Both he and B.M. agreed that B.M. was not privy to this interview. Instead, B.M. claimed that the officer later reported the substance of this exchange to him. As well, in his written motion to set aside the prior order, he claimed there were “charges pending” against T.W. 36. At the hearing, the Landlord’s Counsel submitted an occurrence report obtained by B.M. The report confirmed that the Stratford Police Service (‘S.P.S.’) investigated B.M.’s allegations that T.W. had assaulted him on June 22, 2018 and invaded the rental unit on July 10, 2018 to sexually harass A.J.Y. Having interview both B.M. and T.W., the officers concluded the report with the following: All parties were advised there were no grounds to lay charges at this time and that the matter at hand is a Landlord/Tenant Tribunal matter and not a police matter at this time. This concludes police involvement in this matter. 37. When the Landlord’s counsel confronted B.M. on the considerable disparity between the police report and his written claim that the police intended to charge T.W. with a criminal offence, B.M. was initially evasive. Eventually, he agreed that the police report did not reflect his version of events. He expressed displeasure with the S.P.S. since having paid to obtain the police report under the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Personal Privacy Act, he expected the police provide a report that reflected his version of events. 38. He also attempted to explain the lack of criminal charges against T.W. by stating that the police complied with his instructions not to “press charges” against T.W. Despite B.M.’s claims of a vast knowledge of the legal process, it would appear this latter story is derived more from American television than reality. Lastly, he speculated that the report may not correlate with his expectations because the building he entered to provide his complaint on July 10, 2018 may not have been a real police station. 39. Ultimately, I find that B.M.’s account of his interactions with the police regarding “charges pending” against T.W. is simply a fabrication and that the officers never ordered T.W. to stop harassing the Tenants or that they instructed T.W. not to enter the unit as he claimed at the hearing. Similarly, I find that his testimony that the officers offered a legal opinion that order SWL-19968-18, issued on August 8, 2018, was “null and void” is also not truthful. Nonetheless, despite the content of the police report, B.M. insisted that his version of events was accurate, asserting that whatever he says is by definition fact. 40. By contrast, I find that T.W. and M.G. offered a more persuasive albeit less exciting account of the events of June 22 and July 9, 2018. 41. T.W. testified that at the beginning of the tenancy, he had told the Tenants that they must set up an account with Festival Hydro to assume payment for the utilities as required by the tenancy agreement. 42. As they had not complied by June 2, 2018, the hydro bill for the rental unit came to him. He sent a letter to B.M., reminding him of his obligations under the tenancy agreement and informed him that the Tenants owed the Landlord $152.00. He agreed that he attended outside the rental unit on June 22, 2018 and requested payment of the outstanding hydro balance and that B.M. refused to pay on the grounds that he had no money. He offered to take B.M. to his bank to obtain the necessary funds, but vehemently denied even attempting to grab B.M. When B.M. announced his intention to delay payment of the upcoming rent to a date of his own convenience, T.W. simply stated that he was not happy with this turn of events. 43. On July 9, 2018, after the Tenants had failed to pay the monthly rent for June and July, 2018, T.W. invited them to his office and proposed two options to resolve the issue: they could sign the N11 Agreement or he would serve them with an N4 Notice to terminate the tenancy for unpaid rent. He denied ever blocking their path out of his office or using any threats or profanity in the course of this conversation. He stated that if the Tenants had wished to leave, they could have simply opened the door behind them. He agreed that the encounter was confrontational, but attributed the hostility to B.M. who assumed a belligerent attitude throughout the exchange, at one point offering to engage T.W. in a physical fight. 44. While B.M. incorrectly claimed that he could simply walk away from the tenancy and scoffed at T.W.’s request that they clean the rental unit before vacating it, both Tenants voluntarily chose to sign the N11 Agreement. 45. Having little reason to trust the Tenants after their repeated failures to live up to their obligations under the tenancy agreement, he asked M.G. to listen to their conversation from her desk out of view of the Tenants. While she could not see all parties during their conversations and missed some statements by the Tenants, I find that she substantially confirmed T.W.’s account of the events for both June 22 and July 9, 2018. 46. As noted above, B.M. chose not to cross-examine either T.W. or M.G. on their evidence, opting instead to berate them with his own version of events at them, maintaining his position that he and A.J.Y. are victims and entitled to unspecified but substantial compensation. 47. I find that B.M. intentionally conflated the events of June 22 and July 9, 2018 when he testified that T.W. obtained his signature on the N11 Agreement at the door of the rental unit on June 22 in order to falsely portray his acquiescence to T.W.’s demands as the product of duress and intimidation. 48. T.W.’s version of events is simply more logical and supported by the other evidence. I find that he left the rental unit after B.M. announced his intention to withhold the rent and later proposed the two options to both Tenants in his office on July 9, 2018. He proposed that the Tenants sign the N11 Agreement on that date, not June 22, 2018 as he would have had no reason to bring this form to the rental unit on June 22, 2018 since he only attended at their residence to collect on an unpaid hydro bill, not propose ending the tenancy. 49. I find that the Tenants voluntarily attended at T.W.’s office at his invitation on July 9, 2018 after the Tenants followed through with B.M.’s threat to withhold the rent for July, 2018. Presented with the two options described by T.W., both then signed the N11 Agreement precisely according to the testimony of both T.W. and M.G. This version of events is consistent with the date on the N11 Agreement as well as A.J.Y.’s signature obtained on the same date. Both parties agreed that A.J.Y. was absent from the rental unit on June 22, 2018 and B.M. did not challenge the Landlord’s evidence that he was present at the meeting on July 9, 2018. 50. In light of all of the evidence, I prefer the evidence of T.W. and M.G. to that offered by B.M. While B.M.’s testimony was inconsistent, unreliable and at times patently untruthful, T.W. offered coherent, detailed and internally consistent descriptions of the relevant events that was supported by M.G. and the documentary evidence submitted at the hearing. As a result, I find that the Tenants voluntarily agreed to terminate the tenancy on July 29, 2018 and that T.W. exerted no duress or coercion to obtain that agreement. 51. Having regard to all the circumstances, I therefore do not find that it would be fair to set aside order SWL-19968-18, issued on August 8, 2018. 52. This order contains all of the reasons in this matter and no further reasons will issue',\n",
       " \"I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. This is a very longstanding tenancy in which the Tenant has a track record of making payment on time. The Tenant’s income is very limited. I accepted the Tenant’s proposed repayment plan accordingly. The L2 Application: 10. The Tenant is alleged to have seriously impaired the safety of another person in the residential complex. I find that the Landlord did not meet the onus to show that the Tenant caused a serious impairment to safety on a balance of probabilities. I find that this allegation is not supported by the facts as presented in this hearing. 11. The incident giving rise to the L2 Application occurred in January 2018. The Tenant states that this happened in early January 2018. The Landlord's witness recalls this occurring in late January 2018. The distinction makes little difference. The Tenant admits the incident occurred, but disputes some of the details recounted by the Landlord's witness. 12. The Tenant and the Landlord's witness were friends, or at least friendly, for approximately ten years. The Tenant went out of town around Christmas 2017. After returning, the Tenant felt compelled to share his romantic feelings toward the Landlord's witness. 13. The Landlord's witness states that the Tenant was aggressive in pushing his face into her rental unit, but acknowledged that he did not enter the unit entirely. The Tenant disputes this, and states that he did not enter the Landlord's witness’ unit at all. Both the Tenant and the Landlord's witness agree that the Landlord's witness’ door was open at the time – the Tenant did not break and enter or force the lock. The Landlord's witness recalls this occurring at approximately midnight. The Tenant recalls this occurring at 8:00 or 9:00 p.m. 14. According to the Landlord's witness, the police were called after this event. The Landlord's witness did not provide a police report (although an incident number was read aloud) and the Landlord did not summons any representative of the police force who could have confirmed their attendance and the results of any investigation. The Tenant testified that the police did not make any contact with him regarding this incident. 15. The parties agree about the essential details of the event in question. The Tenant told the Landlord's witness, at the door of her rental unit (where they had often interacted), that he had romantic feelings for the Landlord's witness. The Landlord's witness told the Tenant that these feelings were not reciprocated and that his advances were unwelcome. The Tenant then left the area. 16. After this, the Tenant made no direct contact with the Landlord's witness until the date of this hearing. The Tenant seems to have received the Landlord's witness’ message clearly. 17. The Landlord's witness testified that the Tenant phoned the police “on her” twice after the initial incident. Once to complain of noise and once for a wellness check. The Tenant acknowledges having called for a wellness check on one occasion as he was convinced that the Landlord's witness was in distress or needed assistance. The Tenant denies having made any other contact with the police, and again no corroborating evidence was provided by the Landlord or the Landlord's witness. 18. I appreciate that the Landlord's witness felt uncomfortable when confronted with the Tenant’s amorous feelings. This was plainly an unsolicited and uninvited expression. The Landlord's witness was well within her rights to be annoyed, angry, upset, stressed and generally uncomfortable. If the Tenant were pushing his way into the rental unit, I would have no hesitation in finding that the Landlord's witness was justified in striking him, calling the police and taking whatever measures she felt were warranted in defending herself. However, it is unclear if the Tenant did more than simply stand in a hallway, express his feelings, and accept rejection. The Landlord did not meet the onus in demonstrating that the event in question occurred as the Landlord's witness recalled as this was disputed by the Tenant. There was no compelling reason to find one source of evidence more persuasive than the other. 19. The only aspect of the incident which appears to impact safety is the unproven assertion that the Tenant tried to force the door open. Other than this, the entire affair amounts to an unrequited expression of affection. This is not properly the basis for terminating a tenancy. 20. Perhaps if the Tenant continued in his unwanted advances it would have amounted to substantial interference with the Landlord's witness’ enjoyment of the rental unit. This did not happen and was not the basis of the application filed in any event. Certainly if the Tenant expressed an intent to injure or assault the Landlord's witness I would have viewed things differently. This was simply not in evidence before me. 21. The only aspects of the Landlord’s allegations which were proven on a balance of probabilities were those which were expressly admitted by the Tenant. The Landlord simply lacked the necessary evidence to demonstrate anything else. 22. It follows that the Landlord’s L2 Application is dismissed\",\n",

At the hearing the Tenants raised the following maintenance issues pursuant to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'): cockroach infestation and a broken front door locking system. The Tenant testified that on July 4, 2018, order SWT-17657-18 was issued by the Board with regards to the maintenance application he filed. The Landlord was ordered to hire a professional pest control company to address the cockroach infestation and to repair or replace the front entry door, the handle and lock. The Tenant stated that the front door is in a worse condition than before and that the current locking system moves and the door cannot be properly shut. The Tenant also testified that there are cockroaches running around everywhere in his rental unit and can even be found in the fridge and oven. The Landlord gave evidence that after he received the order, he hired a renovation specialist who strengthened the lose lock with longer nails. He stated that the female Tenant checked the door afterwards and was satisfied with it. He further stated that on July 11, 2018, he contacted a professional pest control technician who attended the unit to treat it for cockroaches and recommended a total of three treatments. The Landlord followed up with a second treatment with the superintendent on October 2, 2018. Analysis Section 20 (1) of the Act states that a Landlord is responsible for providing and maintaining a residential complex, including the rental units in it, in a good state of repair and fit for habitation and for complying with health, safety, housing and maintenance standards. Order SWT-17657-18 issued on July 4, 2018, orders the Landlord to hire a professional pest control company to treat the unit and to repair or replace the front entry door, and fix the door handle and lock as necessary. With regards to the cockroaches, I find that the Landlord partially complied with the order. A pest control technician was hired but only one treatment was conducted even though three treatments were recommended. The second treatment was carried out by the Landlord and the superintendent who are not professional pest control technicians three months after the first treatment. More importantly, the Landlord has not adequately addressed the issue as the infestation has continued. With regards to the front door, order SWT-17657-18 found that the front door was deteriorating and could no longer hold the lock and door handle properly and the Landlord was ordered to repair or replace the door. The Landlords repair efforts were inadequate. He strengthened the lock with longer nails but this was a temporary fix as the Tenant’s evidence is that the lock is still loose and the door does not shut. The Landlord is in breach of the portions of the order relating to the extermination of the cockroaches and repairing the front door. Order SWT-17657-18 authorizes the Tenant to deduct $35.50 per month or 5% from the monthly rent until the repairs are completed if the Landlord fails to carry out the repairs on or before July 15, 2018. As a result, $35.50 for the months of August, September, October and November for a total of $142.00 will be deducted from the rent arrears the Tenants owe. The Landlord will be ordered to replace the front door and to contact the pest control technician again and follow through with any recommended treatments at the recommended times\",\n",

I am not inclined to order the Tenants to pay their rent in guaranteed funds based on a one-time cheque error. The Landlord’s records show the Tenants have made cheque payments 12 times in the past 16 months, resulting in only one incident of a cheque not clearing.

       " 'I find that the N4 notice of termination was served in accordance with the notice requirements contained in subsection 59(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act). B. IS J. M. A TENANT? 6. JM attended the hearing as a named Tenant and testified that she moved into the rental unit on May 31, 2019 and was kicked out of the rental unit by the other Tenants on June 2, 2019, with the first-named Tenant taking her keys. She stated that the third-named Tenant’s fiancée didn’t like her, which resulted in a dispute between the Tenants, so the two Tenants decided to kick her out. Since then, she has had no access to the rental unit, although some of her items remained in the rental unit. 7. Her evidence was that she informed[FE(1] the Landlord shortly thereafter that the Tenants had kicked her out. She stated that she wasn’t even aware of the hearing date until she called the Landlord who told her to attend. This was not contested by the Landlord. 8. The Landlord takes the position that as she signed the lease with the other Tenants, that this was a joint tenancy. The Landlord did not receive a notice from the Tenants to terminate the tenancy, the Landlord did not kick JM out of the rental unit and the Tenants did not agree to take JM’s name off the lease. Thus, JM should still be held accountable for the outstanding rent as the Tenants are joint and severally liable. 9. I asked the Landlord to submit a copy of the lease on or before August 30, 2019. As of the date of this order, the lease has not been submitted. However, JM’s evidence was that she signed the lease agreement with the other two Tenants for the rental unit. 10. Subparagraph 87(1)(b) of the Act says: 87. (1) A landlord may apply to the Board for an order for the payment of arrears of rent if, (a) the tenant has not paid rent lawfully required under the tenancy agreement; and (b) the tenant is in possession of the rental unit. [Emphasis added.] 11. Therefore, question before the Board is whether JM was in possession of the rental unit when the Landlord’s L1 application was filed on August 1, 2019. 12. The leading and definitive case on the meaning of the phrase “in possession of the rental unit” is the Court of Appeal’s decision in 1162994 Ontario Inc. v. Bakker, 2004 CanLII 59995 (ON CA) (“Bakker”). It says at paragraphs 18 to 22: [18]…I think the requirement that the tenant be \"in possession of the rental unit\" at the time of the application reflects a determination that rent arrears disputes can be resolved efficiently and fairly through the Tribunal where the tenant at the time of the application continues to have some connection with the rental unit and, therefore, some relationship with the landlord. Situations where that connection has been severed and the relationship gone are best resolved through the more formal court processes. [19] Some further assistance in defining \"tenant in possession\" is found by an examination of s. 86(2). That subsection provides that a landlord may be compensated for \"the use and occupation\" of a rental unit after notice of termination of the lease. A landlord can only be compensated, however, if the tenant is \"in possession of the rental unit\" when the landlord\\'s application is made. This suggests that a \"tenant in possession\" is a person who was using or occupying the rental unit at the time of the application but does not necessarily indicate that the phrase is limited to users and occupiers. [20] Possession is a difficult concept to define. Both in common and legal parlance, it connotes some form of control over the thing said to be possessed: e.g. D. D, B. N, The Dictionary of Canadian Law 2nd ed., (1995) Carswell at p. 916; The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, Vol. II (1973) p. 1635. Clearly, possession in s. 86(1)(b) is not limited to immediate physical control. For example, a tenant who locks up a rental unit and leaves on an extended vacation, continues to exercise sufficient control over that rental unit so as to qualify as a \"tenant in possession\" for the purposes of s. 86(1)(b). In my view, possession of a rental unit refers to some form of control over that unit as demonstrated by factors such as access to, use of, or occupation of the unit. [21] There will be cases, although I would not think a great many, where a determination of whether the tenant was \"in possession of the rental unit\" at the time of the application will raise a difficult issue. In those cases, the Tribunal will have to decide, based on the evidence, whether there is a sufficient connection between the rental unit and the tenant to permit a finding that the tenant was \"in possession\" of that rental unit. [22] In this case, there was no connection between Bakker and the rental unit at the time the s. 86 application was commenced. Bakker exercised no control over that unit. He had unequivocally, completely, and permanently vacated the unit more than two years before the application. [Emphasis added.] 13. As can be seen from this extract, questions of possession are to be determined on a case by case basis. In this case, the Board is to determine what sort of control JM exercised over the unit at the time the application was filed, whether she had access to it, used it for any purpose, or otherwise had a connection to the rental unit. 14. Given the evidence before the Board, I am satisfied that JM was not in possession of the rental unit on August 1, 2019, when this application was filed. 15. I say this because the evidence is uncontested that the two other Tenants removed her from the rental unit and took her keys, giving her no access or control of the rental unit. The only connection JM has to the rental unit is with regards to her belongings still being in there, only because she does not have the means to go and remove these items. I do not find that she has a real connection to the rental unit just because some of her belongings are still there. 16. Further, the Landlord’s evidence was that they were aware of the situation. Prior to JM’s removal of the rental unit, the hydro bill was in JM’s name. Since she was removed, the hydro bill went into the first-named Tenant’s name until it was cut off at the end July 2019. 17. As JM was not in possession of the rental unit when the application was filed she cannot be named as a party because Board lacks the jurisdiction under s. 87 to order JM to pay anything to the Landlord. Her name will be removed from this order. 18. As JM was removed as a party and the other two named Tenants were not present at the hearing, the merits of the Landlord’s application were heard on an uncontested basis. APPLICATION FOR ARREARS OF RENT 19. The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2019 to August 31, 2019. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 31, 2019. 20. The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,200.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord. 21. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from June 26, 2019 to July 31, 2019. 22. The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed. 23. The arrears and costs owing to August 31, 2019 total $2,575.00. 24. Since the hearing the rents for September 2019 through to January 2020 have also come due. 25. An order shall issue accordingly. 26. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the \\'Act\\'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Landlord is unaware of any circumstances that would justify relief from eviction. 27. This order contains all of the reasons for my decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued',\n",
       " \"I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant the conditional relief from eviction the Tenant seeks. 11. The Tenant’s own testimony indicates she cannot afford the repayment plan proposed. The Tenant says her mother is living with her and has agreed to help out. That is the only way the Tenant could remotely afford the proposed repayment plan. But the Tenant’s mother has no legal obligation to pay the Landlord, and did not attend the hearing to testify as to her willingness to support the Tenant. 12. When I explained this to the Tenant she suggested maybe a more modest repayment plan would be appropriate. 13. This is a relatively new tenancy. The application indicates it started in the fall of 2018. Given the large amount owing to the Landlord, a more practical repayment plan would last longer than the length of the tenancy to date and that seems most unfair to the Landlord. 14. More importantly perhaps, the Tenant’s behaviour to date suggests she cannot be relied on to comply with any promises to pay the Landlord. No payment has been made since August of 2019. She says she has been using her income to pay off debts and loans. She appears to be judgement proof. 15. So the Tenant essentially asks the Board and the Landlord to trust her when she has proven most untrustworthy in the past. 16. Given all of the above, I am satisfied that it would be unfair to impose on the Landlord any form of repayment plan. The Tenant’s promises to pay are unreliable; and it is unfair to expect the Landlord to carry such a large debt simply because the Tenant decided to pay off other debts and loans rather than honouring her obligation to the Landlord. 17. That being said, I am mindful of the difficulties moving and the presence of two young children in the rental unit. Some delay in eviction may be justifiable. But any significant delay would be highly prejudicial to the Landlord as he has exhausted his savings as a result of the Tenants’ behaviour. Therefore, I find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until March 31, 2020 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. But in order to minimise the prejudice to the Landlord, the Landlord will be authorised to file the order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) immediately. 18.

I say this for the following reasons. 9. The Tenant cannot actually afford the repayment plan she proposes based on her own evidence concerning her income and expenses. She says the short fall would be covered by her mother but her mother has no legal obligation to support the Tenant nor does she have a legal relationship with the Landlord. At best the Tenant could afford $300.00 a month which would require more than a year of payments to get to a zero balance. 10. The Tenant is in receipt of ODSP and has custody of one grandchild and is seeking custody of another. Her daughter passed away in February of 2019. The Tenant has lived in the rental unit for about two and a half years as of the hearing before the Board and says this is the first time the Landlord has brought an application concerning the tenancy. 11. The Landlord says the Tenant’s non-payment is causing financial hardship. He is losing his job at the end of November, 2019 so the repayment plan would simply prolong his financial distress. 12. As stated above, the Tenant cannot afford the repayment plan she proposes. Given that and the Landlord’s evidence concerning his own finances, it would be unfair in all of the circumstances to grant the relief requested. Given the passage of time since the hearing before the Board, the Tenant has essentially gained by default much more than the two months delay of eviction that she sought in the alternative. 13. Given all of the above, the Board’s standard voidable eviction order shall issue. 14. This order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued\",\n",

The problem with the Tenant’s proposed repayment plan is that after his expenses are subtracted from his income, he is left with $30.00. Thus, it is unclear how the Tenant will be able to come up with another $500.00 to pay towards the outstanding arrears. 17. Repayment plans are granted in order to allow a tenant to catch up on the arrears while continuing to pay their monthly rent. Here, based on the Tenant’s own statements, a repayment plan would seem to be unrealistic and put the Tenants in further financial distress. 18. Therefore, I cannot grant the Tenant’s request for a repayment plan. 19. The Tenant stated he required more time than the standard eleven days. However, he did not provide the Board with any submissions on how much time he required, and no other circumstances were disclosed with respect to why the Tenant required more than eleven days.

       " \"69 of the Act, an application like this one is based on a notice of termination served in accordance with the Act. As the N5 here was not in accordance with the requirements of the Act, the application must be dismissed. The Board does not have the jurisdiction to evict a tenant based on an invalid notice. 4. With respect to the L1 application, the parties dispute the amount of rent owing. In particular, they dispute how much the Tenant paid to the Landlord in the month of July, 2019. 5. The Tenant says that on July 3, 2019 the Landlord and her spouse were at the residential complex cutting the grass and she paid to the Landlord $1,835.00 in cash. She says that payment represents $1,035.00 she withdrew from her bank account, $700.00 paid to her by her roommate, and $100.00 the Tenant borrowed. According to the Tenant, both her roommate and her father were present when this occurred and her roommate counted out the money for the Landlord. 6. The Tenant offers in corroboration: a copy of her bank records showing withdrawals on July 2, 2019 totaling $1,035.00: and a letter from her roommate that says the roommate gave $700.00 to the Tenant on July 3, 2019 and she saw the Tenant count all of the money before handing it to the Landlord. 7. The Landlord says the Tenant did not give her any cash on July 3, 2019. 8. There is no dispute that on July 5, 2019 the Landlord told the Tenant that July's rent was unpaid. When the Tenant replied that she paid it, the Landlord told her she must have memory problems and to look for it. 9. On July 6, 2019 the Tenant texted the Landlord saying that she was looking for the missing cash and could not find it in the house or in her dad's car. The Tenant says she did this because she did not know what else to do or say. 10. The next thing that happened was the Tenant paid $500.00 to the Landlord via e-transfer on July 13, 2019. 11. Then August rolled around. On August 4, 2019 the Tenant sent the Landlord a text which explains the payment she was making that day. That explanation includes July’s rent and deducts the $500.00 e-transfer but not the $1,835.00 allegedly paid in cash on July 3, 2019. The Tenant says she did this because she could not prove she paid the $1,835.00. 12. So the question here is whether or not I believe the Tenant when she says she gave the Landlord $1,835.00 in cash on July 3, 2019. 13. Given all of the evidence before the Board, I am not satisfied that amount was paid. I say this because the texts of July 6 and August 4, 2019 both contain statements by the Tenant that contradict the assertion that money was paid. If the money had been paid there was no reason for her to state she was looking for it; and there was no logical reason why the Tenant would not have deducted it from the balance owing on August 4, 2019. Although the Tenant offers explanations for these texts, in the face of the Landlord’s denial and the absence of corroborating testimony from the Tenant’s father or roommate, I am not prepared to make a finding that the cash was paid. 14. I would also observe that the bank records may show a withdrawal from the Tenant’s account, but they do nothing to prove the amount was given to the Landlord. 15. Further, the letter from the Tenant’s roommate is hearsay so its contents must be given little to no weight. If the Tenant wished to rely on her roommate’s evidence she should have summonsed her to testify. I would also observe that the letter actually contradicts the Tenant’s own oral testimony. The letter says the Tenant counted out all of the money whereas the Tenant says her roommate did. 16. Given all of the above I find that the rent arrears owing for the period ending November 30, 2019 total $1,588.79 as of the date of hearing before the Board. 17. The Landlord incurred costs of $190.00 for filing the application and is entitled to reimbursement of those costs. 18. The total amount owing under this order for the period ending November 30, 2019 is $1,778.79. 19. The lawful monthly rent is $1,800.00. 20. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction in the form of the repayment plan requested by the Tenant. I say this because the Landlord was content to accept a payment plan whereby rent is paid on the first and arrears are to be paid at the rate of $400.00 per month on or before the 20th of the month until the balance owing is paid. 21. Please note that the order below includes rent charged for the period ending July 31, 2020 due to the delay in issuance of this order.

The family has been travelling back and forth to another community to receive care and were unaware that there is some funding available for medically necessary travel through the Ontario Disability Support Program (‘ODSP’). The first-named Tenant has cut back on work to assist him. Heart surgery has been postponed because the Tenants face the threat of homelessness. 8. The Tenants provided testimony with respect to their income and expenses. That indicates they can afford the payment plan proposed. But based on their evidence they should not have fallen behind to the degree they have. They freely agree with that assessment. They cannot explain exactly what has happened to all of their income, it is a mystery, so they have arranged for budget counselling through ODSP. 9. They have also reached out to the Community Homelessness Prevention Initiative (‘CHPI’) to apply for assistance. They have been told that if the Board grants a repayment plan CHPI will contribute towards the repayment of the rent arrears in the amount of $2,500.00 paid directly to the Landlord. 10. The Tenants have fallen behind in the rent before. But the Board’s records show that prior to this application there was only one previous application for non-payment of rent (in Board file TEL-52064-14) and that was withdrawn through mediation. 11. The Landlord showed me a payment history during the hearing which I read into the record. Essentially the Tenants make sporadic payments, fall behind, then pay extra. But nothing at all has been paid since the application was filed on November 14, 2019. 12. The Landlord says previous N4s have been served, informal repayment agreements have been made and breached, and the Tenants have not had a zero balance owing since February of 2019. Essentially the Landlord has not pursued the arrears aggressively. The Landlord is aware of the second-named Tenant’s health issues. 13. Given all of the above, I agree with the Tenants’ representative. The balance of fairness suggests the Tenants should be given an opportunity to save the tenancy. It would not be unfair in all of the circumstances here to grant the relief requested. The Tenants have mostly paid off rent arrears before without the necessity of Board intervention, they have a realistic and not particularly long repayment plan, being evicted at this point would be a greater than usual hardship because of the second-named Tenant’s health issues and need for surgery, and the repayment plan would put a fairly large sum in the Landlord’s hands fairly quickly. 14. So an order shall issue granting relief as requested. 15. This order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued\",\n",
       " \"I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. 3. NW testified that while her monthly ODSP benefit had historically been $1,642.00, her shelter allowance was canceled from November 2019 onwards, reducing her total monthly benefit to $900.00. This is because the Tenant lived in her sister’s home for an undisclosed period after KW’s death to support the Tenant through the grieving process. However, the sister failed to disclosure to ODSP that she charged rent to the Tenant for this period. 4. From this testimony I deduced that the Tennant asserts that ODSP discounted her housing allowance under the misunderstanding that her housing costs discontinued effective November. 5. NW testified that she did not become aware of this change in a timely way because, perhaps through the effects of Alzheimer’s Disease, KW had forgotten to follow through on his commitment to notify ODSP when the Tenants moved from their prior city of residence to the present one, where ODSP is administered through a different office. 6. The Tenant requested a payment plan, whereby, starting February 1, 2020, she would pay $782.00 toward the outstanding balance until it was satisfied, as well as the monthly rent. 7. The Tenant testified that her monthly expenses, inclusive of her phone, hydro, toiletries and internet is $200.00. 8. Both KA and I expressed skepticism of the proposal’s viability, given that it would leave the Tenant with almost no disposable monthly income. 9. In response, the Tenant testified that she had made an arrangement with her brother, (BW), to move in effective February 1, 2020, and make up any short fall in rent payments. 10. BW testified in corroboration of this arrangement, whereby he will contribute $760.00 monthly, and more as needed, from his monthly ODSP payment of $1,170.00. 11. KA opposed the proposal, given that, in this young tenancy, the Tenants have paid only $20.05 in rent in three months. Further, KA was doubtful that ODSP would continue paying a housing allowance benefit to BW were he move into the unit other than as a tenant. Given the amount of the arrears, it is unlikely that the Landlord would agree to amend the lease to add BW as a tenant. 12. I shared some of KA’s concerns. However, KA’s speculative skepticism about BW’s future benefit notwithstanding, if put into action, the Tenant’s aggressive proposal would resolve the arrears in a very timely way. I was also mindful of NW’s tragic personal circumstances that arose on the cusp the arrears. As such, I orally ruled in favour of the proposal, at which time KA confirmed that starting February 1, 2020 and continuing on the first day of each month, the Tenants will pay $782.00 towards the outstanding balance, as well the monthly rent, until the outstanding balance is satisfied. NW also confirmed that the Tenants understand that If they fail to make any of these payments, the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants\",\n",

I say this for the following reasons. 9. The Tenant says she lives in the rental unit with her daughter who is currently not contributing to household income. While her daughter was in college, her father was helping to support her but that stopped when she decided to take a break from college. 10. The Tenant became unemployed about five years ago, went back to work, had an accident about two years ago and stopped working. She is in receipt of Ontario Works. About two weeks prior to the hearing before the Board she started working part time. 11. The Tenant has been at the Board with respect to this tenancy three times. In August of 2019 she was given an opportunity to save the tenancy with a repayment plan. She had to borrow money to make those payments and in October of 2019 she failed to pay rent in full because she was repaying that loan. 12. The fundamental problem with the Tenant’s request for relief is that the Tenant cannot in fact afford the re-payment plan she proposes. She cannot afford the unit. Currently her total monthly household income is about $1,200.00. Her monthly rent is $1,126.83 and her other expenses total about $445.00. So she cannot afford to pay new rent let alone something towards the rent arrears. 13. As a result, I find that it would be unfair to impose on the parties a repayment plan that will inevitably fail. It would simply result in additional legal proceedings and expense. 14. That being said, the Tenant has clearly fallen on hard times and is trying to meet her obligations to the Landlord. The Landlord is not averse to delaying eviction until March 21, 2020. Therefore, in all of the circumstances I am satisfied it would not be unfair to delay eviction until March 21, 2020. That will give the Tenant the opportunity to try and borrow the amount outstanding or find a new home to live in. 15. The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,126.83 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord. If the tenancy ends as a result of this order, this amount shall be deducted from the total owing. 16. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from March 1, 2019 to November 19, 2019 totalling $14.68. If the tenancy ends as a result of this order, this amount shall also be deducted from the total owing. 17. This order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it.

I say this because the Tenant’s representative says that he although the Tenant is not currently working, he believes the Tenant can make a payment now of $1,500.00 to the Landlord and is arranging to borrow funds from family. He has an uncle, for example, who may be willing to advance him $2,000.00 to $3,000.00 in the next two weeks. The Landlord is unaware of any circumstances that would warrant relief from eviction. 21.

       " \"This application is based on a N7 notice of termination served on the Tenant pursuant to section 66 of the Act. 4. Section 66 of the Act permits a landlord to give a tenant a notice of termination if, a) an act or omission of the tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the tenant seriously impairs the safety of another person, or has seriously impaired the safety of another person; and b) the act or omission complained of occurs in the residential complex. 5. The Landlord testified to the following: • The rental agreement specified the unit was non-smoking and the Tenant was fully aware of the stipulation. • The Tenant began smoking marijuana in his bedroom on May 12, 2020. • The Landlord asked the Tenant several times to stop smoking in the rental unit and even erected a no-smoking sign in the unit. The Tenant was not receptive (swore at the Landlord) and told the Landlord to call the police. • The complex contains a forced air heating system so any smoke from the basement travels through the vents and enters the Landlord’s unit above. • The Landlord’s spouse suffers from high blood pressure and the Tenant smoking marijuana causes her blood pressure to rise. • The Landlord is asthmatic and diabetic. When he smells the marijuana it causes him to have significant difficulties breathing including an asthma attack. • When the Tenant has been smoking marijuana the Landlord and his spouse have had to open all of their windows and leave their unit until the smell is gone. • The Tenant was smoking marijuana in his bedroom on May 19, 2020 which caused the Landlord’s wife’s blood pressure to spike. • On May 21, 2020 at approximately 5:00 a.m. the Landlord and his spouse were awoken by the smell of smoke. The Tenant was smoking marijuana in his bedroom which caused the Landlord’s spouse’s blood pressure to spike and the Landlord had an asthma attack. The Landlord was going to call an ambulance but he used his prescribed puffer and went outside and was able to breath properly again. • The Landlord and his wife were examined by their physician, Dr. H.S. on May 25, 2020. He wrote letters for the Landlord and his spouse supporting their claims that the Landlord’s spouse is “…suffering nasal discomfort and elevated blood pressure…” and the Landlord’s “…asthma is exacerbated due to tenant smoking marijuana at home.” • The Tenant has continued to smoke marijuana in his bedroom almost daily since the N7 was served and the Landlord is very concerned for his health and the health of his wife. They have placed towels in all the air vents and under their door in an attempt to keep the smoke from entering their unit but their efforts have not been effective. • The Landlord has suffered sleepless nights due to the Tenant smoking marijuana in his room and is concerned it will cause him to have an accident at work. He is in the fire restoration industry and sites are often dangerous. He must be well rested in order to perform his job properly and safely. • Nobody has witnessed the Tenant smoking marijuana in the rental unit because he locks himself in his room but said the smell of marijuana originates from the Tenant’s room. • The other two tenants residing in the basement with the Tenant do not smoke and have complained to the Landlord about the smell caused by the Tenant. • The Tenant has not smoked marijuana in his bedroom since June 03, 2020 at 1:45 p.m. as he has rarely been at the rental unit; stops in for a few minutes then leaves. He has not given the Landlord any indication he intends to vacate the unit and in fact has told the Landlord the only way he is leaving is if the Board orders him out. • The Landlord tendered photos of prescribed medications, blood pressure monitoring machine, covered air vents a no smoking sign and texts sent to the Tenant in support of his testimony. 6. KKB testified that he resides in one of the other bedrooms in the basement of the complex. He has never observed the Tenant smoking marijuana but no other tenant smokes and the marijuana smell definitely comes from the Tenant’s bedroom. He described the smell as tremendously strong and it fills the entire basement. He believes the smell causes his blood pressure to rise. 7. Based on the uncontested evidence before me, I find on a balance of probabilities the Tenant has seriously impaired the safety of the Landlord and his spouse by smoking marijuana in the rental unit on a regular basis. I find the Landlord has proven on a balance of probabilities the Tenant does smoke marijuana in the rental unit; the testimony of the Landlord and KKB are consistent in that the Tenant locks himself in his room and the smell of marijuana originates from this location. Further, they both testified nobody else smokes in the rental unit. I also find the Landlord has proven on a balance of probabilities, he and his spouse have pre-existing medical conditions that are being significantly impacted by the Tenant smoking marijuana in the rental unit; resulting in spiked blood pressure, breathing difficulties and an asthma attack. The Landlord’s evidence is supported by 2 letters written by the Landlord’s physician after examinations of the Landlord and his spouse. 8. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. IS THIS MATTER URGENT? 9. In light of the COVID-19 situation, on March 19, 2020 the Board suspended until further notice the issuance of all eviction orders, unless the matter relates to an urgent issue such as a serious and ongoing health or safety issue at the residential complex or a serious illegal act that occurred at the residential complex. 10. In addition, on March 19, 2020, the Chief Justice of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice issued an order suspending the enforcement of Board eviction orders by the Sheriff unless the court orders otherwise upon leave being granted to a party by the court pursuant to the court’s procedures for urgent motions. 11. The burden is on the landlord, as moving party, to establish that this is an urgent situation which requires eviction of the tenant in the middle of the pandemic. In this case, the Tenant has continued to smoke marijuana in the rental unit despite repeated requests by the Landlord to stop. Based on the uncontested evidence before me, the act of smoking marijuana in the rental unit is seriously impairing the health and safety of the Landlord and his spouse. While the Tenant hasn’t smoked marijuana in the unit since June 03, 2020 the Landlord testified it was due to the Tenant not staying at the unit for long periods. However, at any point the Tenant could return for longer periods and again engage in the same behaviour. He has indicated to the Landlord he will not stop smoking marijuana in the rental unit and will not vacate the unit unless ordered to by the Board. Consequently, I find the health risk posed by the Tenant’s conduct is both serious and ongoing. 12. The Landlord has satisfied the test for an urgent eviction presently being applied due the Covid-19 pandemic. I find the Landlord has demonstrated the Tenant poses an immediate, serious health or safety concern for himself and his spouse. Therefore, I find that the tenancy should be terminated despite the current Covid-19 pandemic. Other claims made by the Landlord. 13. The Landlord’s L1 application about rent arrears was not heard due to lack of time. The application will be scheduled by the Board to be heard at a later date as non-urgent hearing\",\n",
       " 'Therefore, I must find that the Tenant voided the N5 notice in accordance with section 64(3) of the Act.

The Tenant says she fell into arrears because she lost her job two years ago, spent one year receiving Employment Insurance Benefits and has now gone back to school under the “Second Career” program where she receives an income of $1,300.00 per month. 9. The Tenant lives in the rental unit with her daughter who is 26 years old and helps to pay for the cable, internet and groceries. The monthly rent is $1,062.35. 10. The Tenant also says that she owns a car and experienced some mechanical problems, which also contributed to the level of arrears. 11. The Tenant would like relief in the form of a payment plan which would see her contribute the remaining $237.65 from her monthly income and pay off the arrears in 15 months. 12. The Tenant says that her school program ends in June 2017 and she already has two potential employment opportunities arranged for when she graduates. The Tenant provided no documentary evidence to support her claim that she will graduate in June or that she will be employed once she graduates. 13. The Landlord says they have been to the Board 6 times with the Tenant since 2010. There have been orders and payment plans, but the Landlord says they have been more than accommodating and this tenancy now needs to end. 14. Based on the evidence before me, I am not satisfied that the Tenant can afford the rental unit nor can she afford to pay the now substantial outstanding rental arrears. Even though the Tenant’s income is enough to cover the monthly rent, it is not enough to cover her other monthly expenses even with her daughter’s help. 15. Also, I am not satisfied that this situation will improve once the Tenant graduates from her program.

The Tenant is seeking relief in the form of a short delay to gather all the required funds. The Tenant says that her loans are now paid off, she is working full time and she has qualified for significant monetary relief from the rent bank which will help her pay off the arrears. 9. The Tenant produced a letter from the Toronto Rent Bank dated January 24, 2017, which confirms that she has qualified for $1,963.16 and this will be processed within 7-10 business days. 10. As this amount exceeds the outstanding arrears and as the date of this order is already 10 business days from the date of the letter, the Tenant should have no trouble paying the outstanding arrears within the standard 11 days that the Landlord is seeking. 11.

The Tenant’s circumstances in this matter are very difficult. The first-named Tenant says that the second-named Tenant has not lived in the rental unit for some time. The Tenant is 7 months pregnant and lives in the rental unit with her 4 year old son who attends school and daycare in the neighbourhood. The Tenant is expecting to give birth at some point in March 2017. 9. The Tenant could not really explain why she has fallen into arrears. She says that she was robbed in December, but that incident did not explain why she had fallen into arrears in November. The Tenant says that she was injured at work and has been making less income. However, even on her modified salary and including her tax benefit and other business income, the Tenant still makes $3,268.00. Based on this income, the Tenant should be able to afford the monthly rent of $1,177.60. The Tenant simply had no explanation for how she has found herself with so much outstanding rent. 10. The Tenant is seeking relief from eviction in the form of a payment plan that would see her pay off the outstanding arrears in approximately 12 months. She says she has no family to assist her and no other place to live. 11. The Landlord’s representative is not agreeable to such a lengthy payment plan and she says that the Landlord has filed approximately 11 applications with the Board during this 3 year tenancy. The Landlord is seeking a standard eviction order which would see the Tenant evicted within 11 days of the date of this order.

Both parties here have sympathetic personal circumstances. 7. This tenancy began on August 1, 2016. The monthly rent is $1,100.00. The Tenant lives there with her 14 year old daughter. 8. The Tenant is a single mother who was working full-time and going to school full-time when a bout of the flu developed into full blown pneumonia in November of 2016. She became too ill to work and then was hospitalised for a few days. 9. In October of 2016 the Tenant short-paid the rent by $50.00. She cannot remember why but she believes this happened because her work hours were shorter than expected. She spoke to the Landlord about it and planned to make up the short fall quickly but then became very ill. 10. By the end of November, 2016 the Tenant was ready to return to work and to school but her employer had decided to hire someone to replace her in the interim so she had no job. Her employment had been “under the table” so she was not eligible for Employment Insurance. Her child support and the child tax benefit total $714.00 monthly and she could not afford to pay rent. She is also in arrears to the Landlord for utilities. 11. The Tenant now has a new job and has temporarily withdrawn from her school program. She started working on January 27, 2017. Her total income is sufficient to pay rent and $500.00 towards her debt to the Landlord every month. At that rate it would take the Tenant more than nine months to pay off the rent arrears alone. 12. The Landlord is also experiencing financial difficulties. He is 65 years old and just started receiving Canada Pension Plan. That and his rental income from two rental properties are his only sources of income. 13. The residential complex has three residential units in it but only two are rented to tenants. The third is occupied by a relative who is not a tenant; he does not regularly pay the Landlord rent although contributes something occasionally. 14. The income from the other two tenants is insufficient to cover all of the fixed monthly costs the Landlord has to pay for mortgage, property taxes and insurance. So the Tenant’s non-payment of rent and utilities has resulted in the Landlord having to draw on his line of credit. His other rental property is a single family home. The rent on that unit is sufficient to cover the operating costs and provide a small income. 15. So the problem is that the Landlord is experiencing financial hardship and the Tenant’s repayment plan is simply too lengthy to be fair given his income profile unfair. 16. That being said, the Tenant should be granted some relief as her illness was unanticipated and beyond her control. Further, the Landlord collected a rent deposit of $2,250.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord. This amount is well in excess of what the Landlord was legally allowed to collect as a rent deposit from this Tenant. Neither party raised this as an issue at the hearing. 17. Given all of the above it seems to me that the fairest thing to do is to issue a standard voidable eviction order but give the Tenant additional time to pay or find a new place to live. 18. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from August 1, 2016 to December 19, 2016 in the amount of $17.39. If the Tenant vacates the rental unit as a result of this order, this amount and the deposit shall be applied to the rent arrears owing. 19.

The rental unit is a 4 bedroom house where the Tenant lives with her two adult sons. One of the Tenant’s sons recently lost his job and is currently not making any income, and the second son is employed but only making a minimal income. 9. It became clear to the Tenant at the hearing that she cannot afford the rental unit. The monthly rent is $2,000.00, the Tenant’s other monthly expenses total $1,677.00 and she has a monthly income of $3,000.00. 10. The Tenant understands that she needs to move out of the rental unit, but she is seeking relief in the form of a 6 week delay of eviction. The Tenant is a senior citizen and has a minor physical disability. 11. The Landlord’s daughter says that the Landlord has experienced financial hardship as a result of the Tenant’s inability to pay the monthly rent for the last few months. The Landlord is seeking a standard order which would see the Tenant evicted within 11 days from the date of this order. 12. Based on the Tenant’s inability to afford the rental unit, as well as the extensive arrears I find it would not be unfair to delay the eviction by two weeks until February 21, 2017\",\n",

It is clear from the evidence that the Tenant is able to pay rent on time, has a prior history of doing so, and is committed to retaining her tenancy. The only reason March’s rent is outstanding is because she thought she was being evicted and he deposit would cover the rent. As long as rent is paid on time into the future, there is no prejudice to the Landlord and this tenancy can and should continue. 17. This order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it.

The L2/N5 Damage Claim 17. The Landlord filed an application to terminate the tenancy because he says the Tenants wilfully or negligently flushed baby wipes down the toilet and damaged the septic system. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the damage 18. The Tenants admit that they hosted a guest from the city for several days who was unfamiliar with how a septic system works. The guest repeatedly flushed baby wipes down the toilet every time she used the washroom and washed her hands. The Tenants admit that it was the guest’s actions that caused damage to the septic system and required the system to be pumped. 19. According to subsection 62 (1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 20016 (the ‘Act’), “A landlord may give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy if the tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person whom the tenant permits in the residential complex wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to the rental unit or the residential complex.” [Emphasis added] 20. While it is true that some baby wipes are flushable, a reasonable person knows or ought to know that not all baby wipes are flushable and the Tenants’ guest should have known that flushing wipes down the toilet can clog any toilet, particularly a toilet that runs on a septic system. 21. Based on the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the Tenants’ guest negligently damaged the septic system and the Tenants have breached their obligations under the Act. 22. However, I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. 23. This is clearly a situation where the Tenants’ guest caused damage to the septic system through no fault of her own. The Tenants’ guest was unfamiliar with the system and did not realize the damage she was causing. 24. In addition, because the guest’s actions took place in the privacy of the washroom, the Tenants had limited knowledge of what she was doing and did not have an opportunity to correct their guest’s behaviour. 25. Based on these circumstances, I find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction. 26. However, I am satisfied that the Tenants should reimburse the Landlord for the costs associated with their guest’s actions. 27. The Landlord says that he had to pay a septic system company $175.00 to have the tank pumped in order to remove all of the baby wipes. 28. The Landlord provided the Board with a copy of a receipt from the company who pumped the tank and the Landlord also called a witness to testify as to why it was necessary to pump the tank. 29. Based on the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the septic system had to be pumped in order to remove the baby wipes and I am satisfied that this service cost the Landlord $175.00. The Tenant should compensate the Landlord for these costs and an order will issue accordingly. The N5 Interference Claim 30. The Landlord says that the Tenants have substantially interfered with his lawful right, privilege or interest because CW has been damaging another tenant’s corn crops by driving his ATV through the farmer’s field. 31. The Landlord owns the rental unit, which is a house and a yard. The Landlord also owns many acres of farmland which surround the house and which he has rented to a tenant farmer. 32. The lease between the parties clearly states that the Tenants rent only the house and the yard. The corn fields around the house are not “common areas” and the Tenants are not permitted to access those fields. 33. According to subsection 64(1) of the Act, “A landlord may give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy if the conduct of the tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the tenant is such that it substantially interferes with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex for all usual purposes by the landlord or another tenant or substantially interferes with another lawful right, privilege or interest of the landlord or another tenant.” [Emphasis added.] 34. Based on the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the corn fields surrounding the residential complex do not form part of the residential complex. The Tenants do not rent the corn fields, they are not permitted to access the corn fields and the corn fields are rented by another tenant. 35. As the corn fields do not form part of the residential complex, subsection 64(1) does not apply to this situation and, even if it is true that the Tenants are trespassing in the fields or damaging the corn, the Board has no jurisdiction to address that situation. The Landlord’s remedy with respect to this issue lies elsewhere. As, a result, the part of the Landlord’s application for eviction that is based on the allegations concerning the corn fields is denied. 36.

The Tenant can pay the rent arrears owing by the end of the month but his sole source of income is social assistance so paying back the filing fees will take some time. He can afford to pay $50.00 a month towards those fees. The Landlord does not vigorously oppose this proposal of the Tenant’s so an order will issue accordingly. 12.

Only the Tenant’s wife, FH, provided testimony on behalf of the Tenants. As the hearing progressed, and in response to the Landlord’s testimony, it became clear that FH withheld information from the Board, provided misleading information to the Board and changed her version of the facts on several occasions. 9. In particular, FH admitted that she provided incorrect information to the Board regarding who is currently living in the rental unit when she failed to mention that her daughter’s boyfriend was living in the unit and is contributing to the household income. She admittedly withheld information from the Board regarding her monthly income and failed to mention that she receives $1,000.00 each month from an inheritance. 10. FH also admitted that she provided misleading information to the Board regarding how she had fallen into arrears when she stated that her home had been “broken into” at Christmas time, when in actual fact, her home had not been “broken into” but her daughters friends had taken $5,000.00 from the home on two separate occasions. 11. FH also provided inconsistent testimony regarding whether she would like to leave the unit and how long it would take to find alternate accommodations. Near the end of the hearing process, FH admitted that she could likely pay the outstanding arrears within 11 days. 12. In the face of FH’s refusal to provide the Board with accurate information regarding who is living in the rental unit, the amount of her monthly income, how she fell into arrears and how long she needs to find a new place to live, and in light of FH’s admission that she is able to pay the outstanding arrears within the standard 11 day time period as requested by the Landlord, I am satisfied that it would unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act\",\n",
       " \"I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act\",\n",

The Tenant lives in the rental unit with 2 roommates who all share the monthly rent. The Tenant says that she has April’s rent ready to pay by April 1st, but she needs some time to gather enough money to pay the outstanding arrears. The Tenant then suggested a payment plan that would see the outstanding arrears paid off by June 21, 2017. 9. The monthly rent is $1,485.00 which means that the Tenant is responsible for $495.00 each month. The Tenant’s monthly income is $706 and all three roommates contribute to rent, groceries and monthly bills. 10. After discussing the Tenant’s income as well as her roommates income, it became clear that the Tenant does not require a delay until June 21, 2017, to pay the arrears. The Tenant then suggested a delay until April 30th to give her time to gather the outstanding arrears. The Landlord had no objection to this suggestion, provided that it was in the form of a voidable order. 11. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until April 30, 2017, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act\",\n",

The Tenant is seeking relief from eviction in the form of either a payment plan which would see the arrears paid off in 7 months, or a delay of 2 months so that he can get his affairs in order and find a new place to live. 17. However, if what the Tenant says is true and he has been withholding the rent since February 2017, there is no need for a lengthy payment plan as he should have the outstanding arrears ready and available to pay the Landlord. Also, there is no need to delay this eviction as the Tenant has admitted, if he is evicted, he will move to the western provinces with his family. The Tenant says that his father could take vacation time and help him move his belongings. 18. As the Landlord has already been waiting at least since February 2017 for any rent payments, I have considered all of the circumstances and I find that it would be unfair to grant any form of relief from eviction in this matter\",\n",
       " \"I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until May 31, 2017, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. If the Tenant does receive his expected cheque on May 27th, it is unlikely that he will be able to pay the outstanding arrears immediately because May 27th is a Saturday. Delaying the eviction until May 31, 2017, should give the Tenant every opportunity to pay the outstanding arrears if his cheque arrives. However, should the cheque not arrive or contain insufficient funds to pay the arrears, the Landlord will then have recourse in the form of an order for eviction. The L2 Application 11. There is no dispute between the parties that the Tenant has substantially interfered with their lawful right, privilege or interest because he has failed to pay the water bill for several months. The current outstanding balance for the water bills is $1,427.51. 12. Based on the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the Tenant’s conduct has substantially interfered with the Landlord's lawful right, privilege or interest. 13. Once again, the Tenant is seeking relief from eviction in the form of a two week delay. The total outstanding amount of arrears and water bills is $7,928.53 and the Tenant says that the cheque for $8,000.00 he is expecting on May 27th will pay for that entire amount. 14. For the reasons already stated, I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until May 31, 2017, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act\",\n",
       " \"I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant the relief the Tenant seeks although some delay is justifiable. I say this for the following reasons. 8. The Tenant has been ill off and on for a while. She produced medical records at the hearing that indicate in January of 2017 she had medical tests done that were inconclusive. She was then in hospital in March of 2017 for some sort of digestive or stomach issue and was released with a referral for additional testing. In March and April of 2017 she was unable to work for a number of days and presented sick notes for time off work. 9. Although this unfortunate medical history might support some sort of relief so the tenancy could continue, the Tenant does not actually want the tenancy to continue. She wants to move. 10. Rather, the Tenant wants the eviction delayed until July 31, 2017 because moving will take considerable time and because she does not want to take her possessions to a new rental unit until they have been fumigated and all pests removed. 11. She says moving will take time because neither the Tenant nor her boyfriend drive and the Tenant’s bail conditions prevent her from being at the unit unless accompanied by Toronto Police Services. But if I understand the Tenant correctly her major concern is that she will take an insect infestation with her to her new home should she have to move before her furniture is treated and all pests eradicated. 12. I believe the Tenant is of the view that an application she has filed with the Board will result in the Landlord being ordered to treat her furniture. The problem with that is it is not a sure thing that the Board will make such an order so the Tenant’s hopes in this regard are contingent on future events. As I suggested at the hearing the sensible thing to do in these circumstances would be to remove the furniture from the unit to storage, treat it there and then move it to her new home. 13. The real problem with the Tenant’s request for relief is that the Tenant is currently subject to bail conditions which require her to live with her surety so she cannot live in the rental unit. There is no indication that situation will change in the short term. 14. The Tenant has two children. One is with her living at the surety’s home where space is limited. The other is temporarily on vacation with his father. The Tenant’s boyfriend remains in the rental unit where he is packing up their belongings in preparation for moving. 15. Given all of the above, there is no real justification for granting the Tenant the relief she requests. She is not living in the rental unit and is already in the process of moving out. Whatever infestation problem she has can be dealt with more promptly and sensibly then relying on the possibility that the Landlord might treat the furniture in the future. 16. That being said, the Tenant is struggling with health issues, her children are young and in school, and not being able to return to the unit except with police may reasonably be expected to cause some delay in moving. As a result, I find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until June 20, 2017 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. This will give the family time to complete the current school year and additional time for the Tenant to pack her belongings and decide how to get her furniture fumigated if that is what she chooses to do. COSTS AND DISPOSITION 17. An order shall issue terminating the tenancy on May 31, 2017 pursuant to the notice of termination for persistent late payment of rent. 18. The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $951.98 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord. This amount shall be offset against the rent arrears owing. 19. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2017 to March 4, 2017 totalling $2.46. This amount shall also be offset against the rent arrears and costs due. 20.

The Tenant has young children. He is working full time. This amount of time should enable him to secure funding to pay the arrears of rent or find suitable accommodations. 6. The L2 application will be dismissed. The Notice of Termination served and filed by the Landlord does not comply with the requirements of section 48 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006. The termination date on a Notice of Termination under that section is required to be the last day of the rental period.

The Tenants have not been living in the rental unit on a daily or regular basis for some time.

The Landlord has a duty to accommodate the Tenant’s disabilities to the point of undue hardship. If he needs to smoke the marijuana and it is prescribed the Landlord must allow this to take place. The fact the smell bothers her does not, in my opinion, constitute undue hardship. 6. The Landlord stated she is allergic to smoke. If I believed that she was I could find the smoke was an undue hardship and that she could pursue termination of the tenancy based on this issue.

I say this for the following reasons. 6. This is a new tenancy. It began in October of 2016. The rental unit is a farm house. There is a barn on the property where the Tenants have horses. 7. The Tenant who attended the hearing says that he was in receipt of Employment Insurance benefits which ran out earlier than he anticipated resulting in the Tenants falling behind in the rent. He also says that three months prior to the hearing he obtained new employment and makes about $4,000.00 to $5,000.00 a month. 8. His spouse, the first named Tenant, works two part-time jobs until school end when one of her jobs also ends. So until the end of June she makes about $2,000.00 a month; after that her income drops to about $1,000.00. 9. The Tenants have two children ages 13 and 9 years old who are home schooled. The Tenants receive a monthly child tax benefit of $806.00. 10. The Tenant estimates the household monthly expenses other than rent total $3,500.00. 11. What this means is that since the end of February, 2017 the Tenants have had a total monthly income of $7,306.00. After monthly expenses the Tenant should have had $3,806.00 available every month to pay the rent. The monthly rent is $2,500.00. But they are currently in arrears of rent. When the Tenant who attended the hearing was asked why the Tenants are in arrears of rent given this income profile, the Tenant essentially indicated that the Tenants had other bills to pay. His truck broke down and needed to be repaired, and they were catching up on other bills. 12. The Tenants produced no corroborating documentary evidence with respect to income or expenses. 13. The Landlord is 85 years old. The rental unit is part of the family farm and she used to live there until it was unmanageable for her. She currently resides independently with her 92 year old sister in a small house in the city. She has no savings to speak of and is reliant on pension income from the government to make ends meet. The Tenants’ non-payment has caused her a great deal of stress. Her children occasionally have helped out by paying for things like her phone bill. 14. Recently, the Board heard another application between these parties filed by the Landlord seeking termination of the tenancy. That application is contained in Board file TEL-79321-17. In Board order TEL-79321-17 issued June 1, 2017, the Board grants the Landlord’s application but delays eviction until August 31, 2017. 15. Given all of the above I am not prepared to grant the Tenants the relief requested. 16. I say this primarily because the Tenants’ evidence with respect to their income is not credible. 17. If the Tenants were making as much as they say they did for the period in question then it is difficult to understand why they are in arrears of rent to the extent that they are. Further, the Tenants should have been able to produce documentary evidence in support of their evidence with respect to income and the expense associated with the truck but did not do so at the hearing. I draw a negative inference from that lack. Finally, even if accept the Tenants’ evidence with respect to their income and expenses it appears they have chosen to privilege other expenses and bills over the rent. That is a choice tenants are entitled to make but the prejudice it causes a landlord is a factor the Board takes into account; it is part of the Board’s purpose to uphold the rights of both landlords and tenants and that includes the landlord’s right to collect rent. 18. That being said the presence of horses on the property means that the Tenants will probably have to find a stable where they can board them. That will take additional time for the move. Given this fact, the financial and emotional pressures the Landlord is facing, and the Tenants’ alleged income profile, it seems to me that it would not be unfair to give the Tenants until June 30, 2017 to pay the Landlord what is owed or move. An order shall issue accordingly. 19. The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $2,500.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from September 29, 2016 to April 27, 2017 totalling $21.67. If the Tenants do not void the eviction order below by paying the amount outstanding then this deposit and the interest owing on it shall be applied to the rent arrears owing. 20.

The Landlord says that he has already received an order from the City by-law enforcement and he has been given a deadline of September 29, 2017, to remove the vehicle and clean up the yard or the Landlord will be penalized with a fine. 9. The Tenant says that he was storing the red van for a friend because he mistakenly believed that he had access to the entire driveway. However, after seeing the lease agreement at the hearing which clearly specifies that he only has access to one parking spot, he has agreed to have the vehicle removed as soon as possible. 10. At the hearing, the Landlord admitted that not all of the garbage in the yard belongs to the Tenant. The parties reviewed the Landlord’s colour photographs of the yard and the Tenant circled all of the articles that belong to him. 11. Based on all of the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the Tenant has interfered with the Landlord’s lawful right, privilege or interest contrary to section 64 of the Act by refusing to remove the red van from the driveway and the garbage from the yard. 12.

At the hearing, the Tenant appeared ready and willing to remove the van and his articles from the yard.

The Landlords’ application for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant based on the assertion that they require the rental unit for residential purposes must be dismissed. The notice of termination served on the Tenant does not meet the mandatory requirements of the Act. 9. Subsection 48(2) of the Act says: The date for termination specified in the notice shall be at least 60 days after the notice is given and shall be the day a period of the tenancy ends or, where the tenancy is for a fixed term, the end of the term. 10. This provision means that a notice of termination for landlord’s own use must provide a date of termination that is the last day of the period of the tenancy. 11. Here the period of the tenancy is monthly and runs from the 8th day of the month to the 7th day of the following month. This means the date of termination on the notice must be at least 60 days after the notice is given and fall on the 7th day of the month.

       " 'RELIEF FROM EVICTION 47. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act. 48. The Tenant says he wants to stay and asks for a repayment plan of $100.00 per month. The Landlord opposes this request on the basis that the Tenant is unlikely to comply with it and cannot afford the rental unit. 49. The Tenant has lived in the unit since May of 2017. He essentially took it over from friends who were renting from the Landlord; the Landlord did not actually rent the unit to the Tenant but let him stay because he knows the Tenant’s family and felt sorry for him. 50. As stated above, the Tenant is in receipt of ODSP. He makes about $1,080.00 a month. The monthly rent is $750.00. His other expenses include hydro ($50.00), a pay and go phone ($15.00), and car insurance ($150.00). He cannot say how much he spends on food but relies on the food bank. He lives alone in the rental unit but his child visits on weekends. 51. The Landlord says the Tenant has never paid rent on time. He says the Tenant told the Landlord’s wife that he just had other bills to pay. The Tenant corroborated that statement in part by saying that although he withheld the rent because of disrepair he no longer has that money to give the Landlord. He used it for truck repairs. 52. The Landlord also says that the Tenant’s non-payment means he has to juggle things to pay his bills. His wife manages the books and the Tenant’s behaviour has caused friction between them. The Landlord’s wife is 70 years old, she has been ill and she has suggested more than once that maybe they should just sell their rental units. She does not want to discuss it; the Landlord gets upset; and the situation is frustrating. 53. Given all of the circumstances here I agree with the Landlord that it appears the Tenant cannot afford the rental unit. At the time of the hearing of the review request the Tenant was four months in arrears of rent and had no money in the bank to pay towards the rent arrears. His income and expense profile and the undisputed evidence of the Landlord with respect to his chronic late payment indicate it is highly unlikely that the Tenant could or would comply with his proposed repayment plan. 54. I would observe at this point that although the rental unit is in disrepair and the Landlord should have inspected the unit back in November of 2017, I am not prepared to make a finding that the Landlord is in “serious” breach of the Landlord’s obligations within the meaning of s. 83(3)(a). The Landlord is in breach of the Act but it is not so serious as to trigger mandatory relief from eviction. 55. That being said, the Tenant suffers from an anxiety disorder, has fallen on hard times and the Landlord is in fact in breach of the Act. The Tenant is not eligible for housing stabilisation fund and it will be very difficult for him to locate new housing. 56. Given all of the above, I find that it would be unfair to impose on the Landlord the repayment plan the Tenant proposes but it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 28, 2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. An order shall issue accordingly. 57. This order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued',\n",

       " 'I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. I say this for the following reasons. 12. The Tenant wants to stay in the rental unit. She says she can repay the rent arrears over time by borrowing the money from her boyfriend. He did not attend the hearing to testify nor did the Tenant produce any corroborating documentation to support this assertion. 13. The Tenant has lived in the rental unit since May of 2016. She lives there alone. The Tenant says she left work about eight months ago and was in receipt of Employment Insurance sick benefits which ran out after 15 weeks. She then applied for and started to receive Ontario Works. She intends to apply for disability benefits but has not yet done so. She says she has an anxiety disorder and suffers from PTSD. Her monthly income from Ontario Works is about $733.00. The monthly rent is $965.00. 14. The Tenant testified in great depth at the hearing about flooding in the rental unit that resulted in disrepair. In response to my questions she stated that she did not wish to raise a claim under s. 82 of the Act; rather she was talking about the flooding and disrepair in the context of relief from eviction. 15. Her primary complaint is that the flooding resulted in mould growth and the Landlord initially promised that when the tenant upstairs moved out, the Tenant would be re-housed temporarily in that unit so repairs could be completed. But when the tenant upstairs moved out, the Landlord moved in. 16. The Tenant takes the position that no mould remediation work should be done while she is in the unit because it will be a health hazard for her. She says she showed the Landlord her puffers to explain why and has refused to let the Landlord proceed with work. She says the Landlord laughed at her. The Tenant did not produce any medical documentation or evidence from a contractor in support of the proposition that there is mould or that remedial work will be a health hazard. 17. The Landlord says she moved into the unit above because she is planning on selling the home where she was living. She also says once she regains possession of the Tenant’s basement unit she has no intention of re-renting it. 18. She also states she has tried to do repairs to the basement unit but the Tenant refuses to co-operate. 19. The Landlord says the Tenant’s non-payment is causing her financial hardship. The utilities are in the Tenant’s name and she is in arrears of those as well. 20. The Landlord produced text messages at the hearing that corroborate most of her evidence. 21. Given all of the above, I find that it would be unfair to grant the Tenant relief from eviction. Her income is insufficient to afford the rental unit let alone pay off the rent arrears or pay for utilities as well. Given her financial situation it would be unfair to the Landlord to permit the tenancy to continue. 22. As for the state of the rental unit, there is nothing in the evidence that would suggest the disrepair to the rental unit or the Landlord’s behaviour with respect to the disrepair constitutes a serious breach of the Landlord’s obligations under s. 83(3) of the Act. The evidence is simply insufficient to meet that test. 23. Given all of the above, the Board’s standard voidable eviction order shall issue. 24.

With respect to the Landlord’s L2 application, before the Tenant left the hearing room she admitted that she had damaged the fire alarm horn in her unit as it was making noise. 7. The Tenant should have contacted the Landlord immediately for action on this rather than taking it into her own hands. 8.

In particular, I have considered that the Tenant has lived in the rental unit since 2014 along with his adult son who has special needs. The Tenant’s income is substantial and he can clearly afford the monthly rent. 8. However, the Tenant says that he has fallen on hard times recently when his father passed away on December 24, 2017. During that same time period, the Tenant says he had to give financial assistance to his ailing mother, as well as his daughter who recently gave birth. Also, during this same time period, the Tenant says that his vehicle required $5,000.00 in repairs and he discovered $800.00 in unpaid parking tickets. For all of these reasons, the Tenant says he has fallen into arrears, although he was able to pay December’s rent in full. 9. The Tenant says that he expects to be able to pay all of the outstanding arrears when he receives his tax return. The Tenant provided the Board with copies of his 2013 and 2014 tax assessments which confirm that he has received a substantial return in the past. However, as the Tenant will not likely obtain a tax return for several months, it would be unfair to the Landlord delay this eviction while the Tenant waits for that return. 10. The Tenant also says he had an ongoing verbal agreement with the Landlord and his son which allowed him to pay his rent late almost every month. Neither the Landlord nor his son were present at the hearing to confirm this arrangement although the Landlord’s representative says that there was no such arrangement. Based on the evidence before me, I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the parties had an ongoing agreement which allowed the Tenant to pay his rent late. 11. The Tenant is seeking relief from eviction in the form of either a payment plan or delay of between 1 to 2 months. I determined at the hearing that the Tenant’s proposed payment plan was incoherent and he was unable to explain to me the precise terms of his proposal. Also, as the Landlord is a retired gentleman who relies on this rental income as a means of monthly support and as the arrears are close to $7,000.00, I find that it would be unfair to delay this eviction by more than one month. 12. Based on the circumstances of both parties, I find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 28, 2018, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act, subject to the Tenant’s ability to void this order by paying the outstanding arrears. In addition, if the Tenant is able to void this order, I find that it would not be unfair to require the Tenant to pay his rent in full and on time for a 12 month period, subject to the Landlord’s right to file for eviction in the event of a breach.

L8 application 6. The Tenants altered the locking system on a door giving entry to the rental unit without the Landlord's consent. L2 application 7. The Landlord’s L2 application is based on an N5 notice. 8. The Landlord’s testimony is that there is black spray paint on the walls, windows and walk way on the outer part of the unit. The Landlord’s testimony is also that the storm door has a dent and the side door frame is damaged. 9. The Landlord testified that the Tenants promised to clean the spray paint and fix the door but they never did. 10. The Landlord testified that the Landlord has not seen the Tenant spraying the paint or damaging the door. 11. The Tenant’s testimony is that the rental unit was vandalised around Halloween and someone sprayed paint on the walls and damaged the door. The Tenant testified that the paint was not sprayed by them and the door was not damaged by them. 12. The burden of proof is on the applicant. I have considered all of the relevant evidence provided at the hearing and find that the Landlord did not provide sufficient relevant evidence to prove that the walls were sprayed by the Tenants or the door was damaged by the Tenants.

With respect to the Landlord’s L2 application, this part of the application was based on an N5 notice that was given to the Tenants on December 22, 2017 with a termination date of January 8, 2018. 8. This is a total of 17 days while the Act states that it must be a minimum of 20 days. 9. As a result the notice was found to be void and was dismissed without prejudice. 10. Under the L2 application the Landlord also requested damages but was unable to provide sufficient evidence as to what the problems were and what the costs were and this matter too was dismissed. 11. With respect to the Tenants T2 application, the Tenant raised two main issues. 12. The first was over noise complaints that they had against others who also live in the rental complex. 13. The Tenants in this application actually have other tenants living both above and below them. 14. Starting in October of 2017 the Tenants started experiencing higher amounts of noise complaints about the other tenants and informed the Landlord of the issues. 15. As far as the Tenants are aware there has been no action taken. 16. The Landlord claims that he was well aware of the complaints from all parties and was doing his own investigation. 17. The problem with this is the Landlord has never told the Tenants what is going on and in fact the only action the Landlord actually took was to give the Tenants an n5 notice which was dismissed as above. 18. One of the other parties involved is also related to the Landlord which makes the lack of transparency even worse. 19. It is clear that all parties are having problems with each other but it was also clear to me that the Landlord had made his mind up as to who to get rid of and no further information was given to them 20. This is not right and I have therefore assessed a 5% rental abatement against the Landlord for the months of October through to April. 21. This then is 7 x 5% x $1,565.50 = $547.93. 22. The other issue that the Tenants raised in the T2 application dealt with a heating issue however they were unable to provide any evidence of any problems encountered and therefore this matter was dismissed. 23. Therefore, I find that the Landlord interfered with the Tenants and substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenants or by a member of their household. 24. With respect to the Tenants T6 application, the only matter here was over what the Tenants referred to as a flood of the lower area however again no evidence of how this affected them was produced. 25. The Landlord agreed that there had been a water pipe issue that had been quickly repaired and that the Tenants were not affected in anyway. 26. As there was no evidence of how the Tenants could have been affected this matter was dismissed. 27. The Reasons contained in this order constitute all of the reasons used in making my decision\",\n",

The Landlord provided evidence that during the relative short tenancy beginning in January 2017 the Tenants were late 10 times in the first 12 months. The Tenant does not dispute this, although some of the late payments were only late by a day or two. 7.

APPLICATION FOR SUBSTANTIAL INTEFERENCE, DAMAGE AND OVERCROWDING 3. The Landlord served the Tenant with three Notices of Termination (‘Form N5’) under sections 62, 64 and 67 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). All three Form N5s are fatally flawed as outlined below. 4. A Form N5 essentially sets out all three notices under the sections noted in paragraph 3 on the same form. Each ‘reason’ as listed in the Form N5 corresponds with a section of the Act. Reason 1 relates to section 64 issues, reason 2 is section 62, and reason 3 is section 67. With each reason there are two choices which are to indicate whether it is the first or second notice under that applicable section. 5. In this case, all three Form N5s the Landlord served on the Tenant set out the following notices: a) Second notice under section 64; b) First and second notice under section 62; and c) Second notice under section 67. 6. None of the Form N5s gave the Tenant an opportunity to first remedy the situation in seven days. For this reason, I find no first notice of termination has been given; therefore, a second notice cannot be served. 7. The Landlord’s Form N5s are all deemed invalid. AGREEMENT TO TERMINATE THE TENANCY 8. The Landlord and the Tenant entered into an agreement to terminate the tenancy at the time of entering into the tenancy agreement. 9. Subsection 37(5) of the Act states, An agreement between a landlord and tenant to terminate a tenancy is void if it is entered into, (a) at the time the tenancy agreement is entered into; or (b) as a condition of entering into the tenancy agreement 10. The Landlord submitted another piece of paper which simply has a rental period listed. 11. Based on subsection 37(5) and the letter lacking in pertinent information, there is no agreement to terminate the tenancy; therefore, this claim must be dismissed. DAMAGE CLAIM UNDER SECTION 89 12. The Landlord’s application claims damages to a carpet in the amount of $100.00; however, provided no evidence of the damaged. 13. When asked, the Landlord stated that the carpet is dirty. This is not damage. As a result, the Landlord’s claim is dismissed. 14. This order contains all of the reasons for my decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued\",\n",

This allows the Tenants to pay the amount they have withheld in order to remain in the unit. If the Tenants fail to make the payment, the tenancy will be terminated. If the Tenants comply and make the payment required, they can remain in the rental unit and pay the monthly rent on the first of each month as they have claimed they can. 12.

The notice shall provide a termination date not earlier than the 20th day after the notice is given pursuant to subsection 64(2)(a) of the Act. 17. In this case, the Landlord only provided 15 days.

The Tenant entered into a “rent to own” agreement with the Landlord and paid a substantial deposit as part of that agreement. Also as part of that agreement, the Tenant has been paying extra money each month that has accumulated to approximately $14,000.00. 6. The Tenant lost his job in December 2017 and he thought he could continue to pay his rent by deducting money each month from those accumulated funds. The Tenant requested that the Board order the Landlord to offset the outstanding arrears from these funds, but I explained to the Tenant that the Board has no jurisdiction over the rent-to-own agreement and no power to offset those funds. 7. The Tenant says that he needs 2 months to find a new place to live. He and his family have established a home for themselves over the last four years; the children attend school in the area, they are accustomed to their surroundings and it will be a major undertaking to move all of the belongings they have accumulated over the last 4 years. 8. The Tenant says that he expects to become employed shortly, but he provided no evidence to the Board in support of his testimony. 9. The Landlord’s representative says that the arrears are already substantial and there is no guarantee that the Tenant can continue to afford the rental unit. Despite having paid a deposit towards the rent-to-own agreement, the Tenant did not pay a last month’s rent deposit which means that any delay that is granted by the Board may possibly lead the arrears to accumulate. 10. Based on all of the circumstances, I find that it would not be unfair to delay the eviction for the 2 months the Tenant has requested. This is a long-term tenancy in which this large family is experiencing financial hardship due to a loss of income as well as an unsuccessful rent-to-own agreement. I am satisfied that they will require additional time to find a new place to live and I find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction for 60 days after the hearing date which is June 13, 2018, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act\",\n",
       " \"I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. L2 Application 6. The Tenant was given a first Notice of Termination under section 64 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2016 (the ‘Act’). The termination date was February 16, 2018. The notice cites the Tenant’s failure to allow the Landlord access to the electrical room to check the wiring associated with an emergency power loss. It also sets out the Tenant’s failure to pay the portion of the utility bills that he is responsible pursuant to the lease agreement. This notice was not voided. 7. The Landlords gave a second Notice of Termination, served on February 14, 2018 with a termination date of March 1, 2018. The second notice sets out the issue of overcrowding in contravention of the lease agreement; non-payment of utility bills; interference with access to the basement for repairs and maintenance and unpaid rent. 8. Based on the uncontested evidence before the Board, I am satisfied that the Tenant has substantially interfered with the Landlord’s lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord. 9. The Tenant has failed to pay the Hydro and Enbridge Bills as required under the lease agreement. The Landlord has provided a copy of the lease agreement along with copies of the Toronto Hydro Bills and Enbridge Bill as supporting evidence at the hearing. 10. The Tenant owes $539.70 for Hydro and $436.40 for Enbridge for the period of November 2017 to April 2018. The Landlord has repeatedly asked the Tenant to pay his bills but he has failed to do so. 11. The Landlords provided a copy of the Lease Agreement signed by the Tenants and Landlord, along with copies of the outstanding Utility Bills for March and July 2017. The Landlords also provided convincing evidence of attempts to contact the tenant and in an effort to resolve the outstanding amounts owing. All documents were entered as Exhibits at the hearing. 12. The Landlord testified that he had to pay all of the Tenants’ outstanding utility bills in order to preserve his name and keep his property secured. He has suffered significant financial impairment from the tenants’ failure to comply with the terms of the lease and tenancy. 13. The Tenant or a person permitted in the residential complex by the Tenant has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit by damaging the basement drywall and the shower glass sliding door. The uncontested evidence of the Landlord was provided at the hearing. I find that the damage is not due to normal wear and tear. 14. The Landlords will incur the costs of $850.00 to repair the damage. 15. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act\",\n",
       " 'I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act. 15. The Tenant is a plumber. He lives alone but he has four children and visitation rights so they are in the unit weekly. 16. He fell behind in the rent when he did a job and did not get paid. The Tenant says when he found out about the legal proceedings he tried to pay the arrears to the Landlord but the Landlord would not accept partial payment. 17. The Tenant initially stated at the hearing that he has $4,000.00 right now and an additional $2,000.00 coming very soon. But he then showed me his account balance on his cell phone which only shows he has $2,300.00 He then stated his girlfriend was willing to provide him with $2,200.00. 18. The Tenant cannot really explain why he was persistently late paying the rent the entirety of his tenancy. He says he is forgetful sometimes and he would often find the office closed when he went after hours to pay by debit. 19. In March of 2018 the Tenant made a consumer proposal in bankruptcy. For some unknown reason the Landlord was not identified as a creditor and was unaware of the bankruptcy proceedings. 20. Given all of the above, I find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. Even if the Tenant were able to pay off the rent arrears, his behaviour indicates it is highly unlikely he will start paying rent on time. The Tenant seems to have more difficulties with his financial situation than he can explain and his evidence is simply insufficient to support the assertion that he can or will pay rent on time in the future. As a result, it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction and the Board’s standard eviction order shall be issued. 21. This order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued',\n",

       " \"I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. 14.

There is no convincing evidence before the Board establishing that the Tenants can afford the rental unit based on their combined incomes. The repayment plan proposed by the Tenants does not address new rent as it becomes due and in fact, they cannot afford to pay the rent and the arrears simultaneously based on the numbers provided at the hearing\",\n",
       " 'As the Landlord has not increased or decreased the rent in accordance with the Act that is still the lawful monthly rent for Board purposes. 16. The Tenant paid $1,200.00 after the application was filed so the arrears of rent owing for the period ending June 30, 2018 as of the date of the hearing on June 6, 2018, total $3,690.00. 17. The Landlord incurred costs of $175.00 for filing the application and is entitled to reimbursement of those costs. 18. So the only real issue between the parties is the Tenant’s request for relief from eviction in the form of more time to pay. The Tenant wants more time to pay because he believes his income is about to change and he will be able to pay the arrears of rent and the monthly rent going forward. He asks that he be given until July 31, 2018 to pay the amount outstanding. The Landlord opposes the Tenant’s request for relief. 19. The residential complex here is a for profit care home with 152 beds and 100 employees. The Tenant’s rent is subsidized by the local municipality. Non-subsidised individuals pay between $3,000.00 and $4,500.00 a month. 20. The Tenant moved into the residential complex in January of 2017 into a different rental unit. He was subsequently moved to the unit he now occupies in the spring of 2017. 21. The Tenant says he was born and raised in the local area and he wants to stay. 22. The Tenant has multiple serious medical conditions. The letter from his physician states he is an insulin dependent diabetic and as a result of complications related to diabetes had a below the knee amputation. He has impaired executive functioning, a history of mild cognitive impairment, cirrhosis/end stage liver disease and a number of other health challenges. 23. The Tenant says that when he moved into the rental unit he did not plan to stay long term but his healing has not been going well and he ran out of funds. He says the only service he receives from the Landlord is food for $260.00. He applied for long-term care but was informed his condition was such that he is not yet eligible. He also applied for social housing. 24. The Tenant says that he has exhausted his savings. Part of the reason why he has not paid the rent to the Landlord is because he had to pay $3,000.00 for a prosthetic. He also had to pay for transportation home from the hospital more than once. 25. The Landlord provided a ledger that shows the last time the Tenant had a zero balance was December 5, 2017. Between August and December 2017 the Tenant was late paying the rent every month. 26. The Tenant is in receipt of Canada Pension Plan (‘CPP’) benefits and Old Age Security (‘OAS’). Together those total about $1,150.00 monthly. As the total charged for rent and food is $1,250.00 the Tenant cannot currently afford the rental unit. 27. About two months ago the Tenant says he applied for the guaranteed annual income supplement (‘GIS’) but has not yet been approved. He says that he tried to apply for GIS earlier but did not complete the application process correctly. He has been told that he should be approved and his entitlement would be about $400.00 to $600.00 monthly with an arrears back payment coming to him of $5,000.00. He has also been told he would be eligible for a supplement from the City’s Eviction Prevention in Community (‘EPIC’) program. 28. The Landlord says the other residents of the home have expressed resentment over the Tenant’s failure to pay rent as they are aware that the amount he has to pay is considerably less than the market rent they pay. Dealing with that resentment can be challenging. In addition, this is a for profit business so the Landlord must cover its overhead. The Tenant is also in arrears of his service fees for food. 29. Given the unavoidable passage of time that has occurred since the hearing was held, the Tenant’s request for relief is moot. In other words, the Tenant has gained the delay he seeks merely because of the delay in issuing this order. So having considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, I find that it would be unfair to grant additional relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenant has either obtained the funding he was seeking by now and will be able to void this order, or he has not, and has received the time he asked for to find a new place to move to. Further delay would be unfair to the Landlord. So the Board’s standard order shall issue. 30. This order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it.

As a result and absent any other evidence of the Tenant’s circumstances, I find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction with respect to the non-payment of rent application beyond the Board’s standard voidable eviction order but it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction if the arrears are paid in full subject to the conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. 9.

The Tenant requested some extra time before being evicted from the rental unit which has been achieved by virtue of the fact that this order was not written immediately after the April 11, 2018 hearing. 15. In consideration of the significant arrears and the Landlord’s reliance on the Tenant’s offer to terminate at the end of February, and the Tenant’s failure to provide reliable evidence of a viable repayment plan or intention to repay, I find the Landlord’s circumstances to be most compelling. 16.

APPLICATION FOR PERSISTENTLY LATE PAYMENT 5. I am satisfied the Tenants have persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due based on the following evidence. 6. The Landlord submitted a list dates when the Landlord served notices of termination on the Tenants beginning December 2016 for a total of six notices. 7. The Landlord also submitted a list of the following applications to the Board for this tenancy: TEL-20273-11; TEL-32954-13; TEL-63233-15; TEL-71591-16; TEL-84109-17; and TEL-81319-17. 8. The lease signed September 5, 2005, states that rent is due on the first of each month. 9. Even after the Tenants were served a notice of termination for persistently late payment of rent the Tenants continued their behaviour and did not pay their rent on time. 10.

The Landlord’s application alleges the Tenant changed the locking mechanism to the rental unit and failed to provide a copy of the new key to the Landlord. 11. The only evidence offered in support of this assertion at the hearing was a photograph showing some minimal marking of the face of the lock. That is insufficient to establish that it is more likely than not that the Tenant actually changed the lock. Absent evidence that the Landlord’s key no longer fits in the lock or works to open the door, the evidence is insufficient to support a finding that the Tenant altered the locking mechanism and failed to provide a key to the Landlord. 12.

L2 application 1. On February 27, 2018 the Tenant was served with a first Notice of Termination under section 64 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2016 (the ‘Act’) with a termination date of March 19, 2018. This notice was not voided because the Tenant and the Tenant’s guests contined to yell, scream, slam doors and swear during the nights and days that followed the notice. . .. 2. The Notice provides a log of dates and times of disturbing yelling, screaming, banging and swearing emanating from the Tenant’s rental unit. Overall there are 16 complaints from other tenants in the building dating back to September 2017, and two official complaint letters from the City of Oshawa By-Law enforcement unit dated September 2017 and February 2018. 3. Based on the uncontested evidence before the Board, I am satisfied the Tenant has substantially interfered with the other tenants' reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex and substantially interferes with a lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord by making loud and disturbing noise in the rental unit on a frequent basis. The tenancy is terminated for the reasons that follow. 4. The Landlord brought three witnesses to the hearing however due to time constraints only one witness testified. The Landlord confirmed that each witness experienced the same interference with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential premises. 5. Amy Ifurung, a tenant’s unit is very close to the Tenant’s unit, testified at the hearing. She moved into her rental unit in June 2017. From September 2017 onwards, she experienced frequent loud screaming and arguments between the Tenant and a female visitor. The language was abusive and disturbing and was occurring frequently at all hours of the night and during the day. 6. This was so frequent and concerning that the witness filed a complaint with the city of Oshawa. The first complaint was filed in September 2017 and the second noise complaint with the city was filed in January 2017. A third complaint was made to the city of Oshawa in April 2017. All complaints were documented and the Landlord has provided the letters from the city of Oshawa, Municipal Law Enforcement and Licensing Services in support of the application. 7. The witness testified to living in the rental unit with her 12 year old son. They are both unable to sleep due to the frequent nightly disturbances and the witness, who does shift work, testified that even during the day the fighting is so loud that she is unable to rest in between shifts. She has contacted the police on two occasions as they were afraid for their safety, and for the safety of the female who was screaming inside the rental unit. 8. The Landlord also provided emails and had recordings made by other Tenants of the disturbances. One of the tenants, wrote about having to leave the rental unit with her young son as the fighting was causing him great anxiety. The tenant writes of banging of doors and screaming, where she believed that someone had been locked in a closet. Numerous other testimonials are contained in the Landlord’s disclosure package providing details of the noise and the detrimental impact on them. 9. The Landlord requested termination of the tenancy. 10.

The Landlord delivered several notices to the Tenant requesting payments, as set out in the N5 notice that was served on the Tenant. The Tenant did not provide payment. 6. The Tenant’s conduct has interfered with a lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlords by failing to pay outstanding utility bills pursuant to the lease agreement. 7. The Tenant did not correct the problem by paying the outstanding bills during the seven days following the Landlords’ service of the N5 Notice of Termination. Therefore, the N5 Notice of Termination was not voided by the Tenant. 8. The update sheet provided by the Landlord indicates that the Tenant owes $157.65 to the Landlord for unpaid utility bills. The Landlord did not present evidence on how this nominal amount of arrears has affected his rights. 9.

The Tenant says she fell into arrears of rent when she lost her job in mid-January of 2018. She applied for Employment Insurance (‘EI’) which got “messed around” forever and a day leaving her with no income. 15. This testimony on the part of the Tenant is also not credible. The same text message discussed above dated December 21, 2017 says that the Tenant has not yet paid December’s rent because she is waiting for her EI to arrive. If the Tenant did not lose her job until mid-January of 2018 then she cannot have applied for EI prior to December 21, 2017. 16. The Tenant also says she is going through a divorce. Divorce proceedings started 6 months ago and she has a court date on May 28, 2018. She anticipates she may receive a divorce settlement, be in funds at that time and her assets will be unfrozen. No corroborating documentation with respect to these statements was filed into evidence. 17. The Landlord says the Tenant’s non-payment is causing him some financial difficulties. 18. The residential complex is a 15 unit building. The Landlord says he has utility bills and a mortgage to pay. He is a general contractor with his own business but lately he has not been doing contracting jobs because he has been working on the residential complex. He recently spent $5,000.00 for sewage repairs and bounced his cheque to the contractor. He owes money to hydro. He is three days late paying the mortgage and he has no line of credit. The Landlord produced no corroborating documentation with respect to these statements. 19. After the Landlord completed his testimony about his circumstances the Tenant called the Landlord a liar and despite my requests that she remain, she walked out of the hearing. 20. Given all of the above, I am not satisfied that it would not be unfair to delay the eviction as the Tenant asks. Her general lack of credibility means that I am not prepared to accept that as of May 28, 2018 it is more likely than not that she will have access to fund. Rather, I find that it is more likely than not that she will neither have the means nor the desire to pay the Landlord any more rent money and simply seeks to delay eviction as long as she can. As a result, the Board’s standard voidable eviction order shall issue. 21. The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $800.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord. 22. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 1, 2017 to April 7, 2018 totalling $14.70. 23. This order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued',\n",

THE APPLICATION FOR PERSISTENTLY LATE PAYMENT 8. The Landlord served the Tenant with a notice of termination which alleges that he has persistently late in paying his rent. However, as I explained to the Landlord at the hearing, the details on the notice do not substantiate the Landlord’s position. 9. The notice of termination says that the Tenant has been late paying his rent 3 times out of 6 from September 2017, to February 2018. 10. Based on the evidence before me, I am not persuaded that paying his rent late 3 times constitutes being “persistently late” as contemplated the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). For these reasons, the Landlord’s application is dismissed\",\n",
       " \"Relief From Eviction 17. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). The circumstances here are that, based on their monthly income and expenses, the Tenants cannot afford the rental unit. The Tenants have been living in the unit since July 2017 and they have already secured another place to live. The Tenants are seeking relief from eviction in the form of delay until July 5, 2018, when their new living accommodations will be available. 18. The Landlord says that he is experiencing financial hardship because the Tenants have not been paying their rent. The arrears are now substantial and they continue to grow. 19. Based on all of the circumstances, I find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenants cannot afford the rental unit, the arrears are now quite substantial and this is a relatively short-term tenancy. The Tenants also committed an act which interferes with the Landlord’s rights and compromises the safety of the other residents in the building. For these reasons, I find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction\",\n",
       " \"I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and for the reasons that follow find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. 9. This tenancy began in 2014. The Tenant moved in with his spouse but he now lives alone. 10. The Tenant works construction. He is a heavy machine operator. The Tenant says that he has experienced a number of work interruptions and periods of unemployment since 2016. In 2016 his employer went bankrupt and he was laid off for several months. He went onto Employment Insurance (‘EI’) and was mostly unemployed until October of 2017. The Tenant was laid off again in December of 2017 and was ineligible for EI due to insufficient weeks of employment. He did some work under the table, borrowed from friends, exhausted savings, and in February of 2018 applied for Ontario Works. He says that he returned to work the day before the hearing. 11. The Tenant says his monthly employment earnings will be between $2,700.00 and $3,000.00. His monthly expenses other than rent are about $1,245.00. This means the Tenant has between $135.00 and $535.00 a month available to repay the rent arrears. The Tenant states that he will have a roommate in June who will contribute $600.00 a month towards the household income. In addition, he has contacted the City’s EPIC program to apply for help paying off the rent arrears. 12. The Tenant produced no supporting documentation corroborating his testimony. 13. In response to my questions about the Landlord’s circumstances, the Landlord’s representative said this is the first application to the Board with respect to this tenancy although there have been numerous notices to terminate for non-payment of rent. There have been no warning letters about the dangers of paying rent persistently late. 14. So the issue for the Board is whether or not it would be unfair in all of the circumstances to grant the Tenant some relief from eviction. 15. The Landlord argues that none of the Tenant’s evidence is corroborated, without a roommate the Tenant cannot repay the rent arrears in a timely manner, and the Tenant does not have a reliable plan for the future. The Landlord seeks eviction. 16. What the evidence establishes is that despite financial challenges this is the first application to the Board about this tenancy in four years, so the Tenant has demonstrated the capacity to deal with difficulties in the past. In addition, the Landlord’s ledger indicates that in the 12 months during which rent was paid late, it was still paid within the first week of the month for 7 of those 12 months. Given these circumstances it seems to me that it would not be unfair to give the Tenant an opportunity to save the tenancy and start paying rent on time. 17. That being said, the precariousness of the Tenant’s earnings in the past suggests that a repayment plan would not be advisable. The nature of the Tenant’s employment appears to include regular lay off periods. The Landlord should not bear the burden of that kind of cyclical dips in the Tenant’s finances. 18. Given all of the above, an order will issue permitting the Tenant to avoid eviction for non-payment of rent by repaying the rent arrears to the Landlord by June 15, 2018. If the Tenant can achieve a zero balance by that point in time then it would not be unfair for the tenancy to continue subject to the requirement that rent be paid on time. 19.

APPLICATION FOR PERSISTENTLY LATE RENT 10. The Tenant has been persistently late paying the rent, which is due on the 15th day of each month. While the Tenant disagreed with the dates the Landlords submitted the Landlords provided copies of the EMTs received from the Tenant and the dates correspond to those payments. 11. It is clear the Tenant has not paid the rent on the 15th of the month for the last year. The Tenant argued that he waited to pay because the Landlords were reimbursing him for payment he made for a hood range for the stove; however, based on the Tenant’s own receipt from the purchase, he knew the cost of the reimbursement on February 10, five days prior to rent being due. 12. I am satisfied the Tenant has been persistently late paying his rent and a pay on time order shall issue. 13. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. APPLICATION FOR SUBSTANTIAL INTERFERENCE 14. At the hearing, the Landlord requested the consent of the Board to withdraw their application for substantial interference of reasonable enjoyment. 15. In accordance with subsection 200(4) of the Act, I consent to the withdrawal of this application. TENANT’S SECTION 82 APPLICATION 16. The Tenant claims that Landlords have imposed landlord type duties on him when he should not be put in that position. For instance, the Landlords wanted him to wait around for a contractor to install the stove, and wanted him to purchase the hood range for the stove. Now the Landlords want him to supervise the fixing of the dishwasher. 17. The Tenant told the Landlords in March 2018 that these types of issues were the responsibility of the landlord, but the Landlords have continued to ask the Tenant to perform the duties. The Landlords did not deny this and admitted to telling the Tenant to do these things. In April 2018 the Landlords told the Tenant to assist with the fridge repair. The first-named Landlord stated that he did not believe it was unreasonable and the Tenant should do these activities. 18. The fact is that the Tenant did perform these duties for the Landlords, but terminated that understanding when he told the Landlords they were to complete them. As of that time, the Landlords had no right to impose on the Tenant with any landlord related obligations. 19. Given the inconvenience the Tenant has expressed he has gone through purchasing items for the Landlords, being present to orchestrate repairs, and my knowledge of similar applications, I find a reasonable abatement of rent to be $200.00. This is based on the Landlords’ continued behaviour after the Tenant told them to cease. 20. This order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued\",\n",

APPLICATION FOR SUBSTANTIAL INTERFERENCE 5. The Landlords served the Tenant with a second Notice of Termination for substantial interference of reasonable enjoyment; however, the Notice does not indicate a rental unit. 6. Subsection 43(1)(a) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') states a notice to terminate a tenancy must indicate the rental unit. 7. This means the Landlords’ second Notice of Termination is invalid. The first Notice of Termination served on the Tenant had a termination date of February 11, 2018. The application was filed on April 26, 2018. The Act states a notice of termination becomes void 30 days after the termination date specified in the notice in subsection 46(1); therefore, the application could not be amended to address the first Notice as it is void. 8. Given the above, the Landlords’ L2 application must be dismissed\",\n",

The Tenant’s circumstances are exceptional and she has otherwise been a responsible Tenant. The Tenant was careful not to commit to a repayment plan that she could not afford and offered a reasonable repayment schedule that fit her particular current circumstances. The panel is confident that she intends to follow through on the repayment and keep her tenancy. 14.

I have considered that this is a long-term tenancy and the Tenant suffers from various medical conditions. I have also considered that the Tenant has paid her rent into the Board in trust for the last three months which means the arrears have not increased substantially since the application was filed. I find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until September 30, 2018, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. This short delay should provide the Tenant with adequate time to find alternate accommodations\",\n",
       " \"I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). In particular, I have considered that the Tenant has lived in the rental unit for approximately 9 years along with her three children ages 13, 11, and 6 years old. I have also considered that, based on the Tenant’s monthly income and expenses, the Tenant cannot afford to live in the rental unit. In fact, the Landlord’s agent confirmed at the hearing that this is now the 16th application for non-payment of rent that the Landlord has brought regarding this tenancy. The Board’s records confirm the agent’s statement. 11. The Tenant says that her mother repeatedly helps her with her monthly expenses and her mother will help her with any money she needs this month. The Tenant says she can pay the full amount of outstanding arrears by June 10th when both of her social assistance cheques have arrived. Although this leaves the Tenant with no money for any of her monthly expenses, the Tenant is confident that her mother can help her with whatever she may need. 12. The Landlord says this tenancy needs to end. The Tenant clearly cannot afford the rental unit and the Landlord should not be forced to repeatedly come to the Board in order to chase the Tenant for the monthly rent. I agree with the Landlord’s position. 13. Based on the evidence before me, I find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenant cannot afford the rental unit, but she refuses to move to a more affordable location. Instead, she relies on her mother’s help and delays paying her rent until the Landlord is forced to file an application with the Board. This pattern of conduct is unfair to the Landlord and the tenancy must be terminated. 14. For these reasons, I find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction, subject to the mandatory requirement that the Tenant pay the arrears within 11 days in order to void the eviction order. As the standard 11 day order requested by the Landlord actually gives the Tenant more time than she says she needs to pay the arrears, there is no reason to grant any further relief in the form of a delay. A standard order will issue accordingly\",\n",

With respect to the Landlord’s L2 application, the Landlord served the Tenant with two different notices. 7. The first notice was an N7 notice for serious impairment of safety of a person and also for use of the unit being inconsistent with use as a residential unit. 8. No evidence was presented at the hearing that was even close to either of these descriptions and the N7 notice was dismissed. 9. The Landlord also served an N5 notice. 10. The first matter under the loss of reasonable enjoyment was the fact that the Landlord is storing items in the basement. As this is clearly set out in the lease agreement between the parties this matter was dismissed. 11. The other issues were over smoking in a non smoking building and the Tenant not cooperating with inspections of the unit as allowed under the Residential Tenancies Act. 12. While there was no clear evidence on either of these matters, on the balance of probabilities it is possible that they may have occurred. 13. The tenant agreed at the hearing that these would never occur again and as a result a section 78 provision was placed in the order so that if the order is voided under the payment issues the section 78 clause will live on for a one year period. 14. The Landlord was warned at the hearing that if section 78 is breached and an eviction is applied for strong evidence would have to be shown at any hearing. 15.

The particulars of the notice indicate that beginning in April 2018 the Tenant made loud noises during the night which disrupted the Landlord and other tenant. 6. The Landlord alleges that the Tenant is also smoking marijuana in the rental unit which is entering the venting system and causing medical distress to the Landlord. A prescription for an inhaler was provided as evidence of the medical condition of the Landlord. In addition, the Tenant has a dog which is in violation of the lease agreement. The Landlord is highly allergic to pets. 7. The Landlord provided a copy of the lease agreement where it is set out that there is to be no loud noise, no smoking in the unit and no pets. 8. The Landlord’s uncontested evidence is that he spoke to the Tenant on several occasions about the conduct however the Tenant was non-compliant. 9. The Landlord also provided photographs of garbage strewn around the rental property by the Tenant. He has been unable to get the Tenant to clean up his mess. 10.

The Board has already issued an order terminating this tenancy for persistent late payment. The Landlord indicates it intends to enforce that order through the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) on or after November 11, 2018. That order is contained in Board file TEL-92736-18. The Tenant says she is prepared to move but wants more time. As I explained to the Tenant at the hearing, at the hearing of this application I do not have the power to alter the Board’s order in Board file TEL-92736-18. The Tenant indicated she had seen Tenant Duty Counsel and been given a referral but the Board’s records show no review of Board order TEL-92736-18 has yet been filed. 9. Given the above, there is no point in giving the Tenants additional time to pay the rent arrears owing. The tenancy is lost regardless of when the Tenants pay the Landlord the outstanding amount. At the hearing I indicated I would issue the standard order which is set out below. 10. I would note however for the record, that Board order TEL-92736-18 includes per diem compensation for the period starting September 1, 2018. Obviously that period overlaps with the period covered here. The Landlord is not entitled to collect rent for the same period twice, so it is the expectation of the Board that the Landlord will enforce Board order TEL-92736-18 only to the extent of obtaining eviction and collecting its costs of filing that application. But with respect to rent and daily compensation, the Landlord should only enforce this order. 11. This order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued\",\n",
       " \"I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until December 5, 2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. I say this for the following reasons. 10. The Tenant says he has lived in the rental unit since August of 2012. He lives there with his 18 year old daughter. In July and again in August of 2018 he had deaths in his family and travelled to the United States as a result. That is the primary cause for the Tenant being in rent arrears and needing time to pay. 11. The Landlord opposes the Tenant’s request because of the extensive history before the Board of prior applications involving this tenancy. The Board’s records indicate there have been at least seven prior applications for non-payment of rent as well as an application about a breached repayment plan. With respect to the latter of these the Board’s order warns the Tenant he is being given a “last chance” to put the Tenant’s financial house in order. 12. I understand where the Landlord is coming from. At some point in time a tenant’s history of failing to meet his or her obligations is so extensive that further relief becomes unfair to the landlord. Essentially a point is reached where enough is enough. 13. That being said, I would note that the Act does not permit the Board to say enough is enough on applications such as these. Pursuant to s. 74(3) of the Act the Board is mandatorily required to insert a clause in its order that gives the Tenant time to pay off the rent arrears and filing fee to save his tenancy. 14. Given the unavoidable passage of time between the hearing of this application and the writing of this order, the Tenant’s proposed repayment plan is only three additional days’ worth of delay. Given that I have no reason to doubt the Tenant’s evidence as to how the arrears occurred, it seems to me that under these circumstances giving the Tenant until December 5, 2018 to clear the rent arrears and costs would not be unfair to the Landlord. A standard voidable eviction order shall issue giving the Tenant until December 5, 2018 to clear the debt owing. 15. This order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it.

THE APPLICATION FOR PERSISTENTLY LATE PAYMENT 9. At the hearing, the Landlord requested the consent of the Board to withdraw their application. 10. In accordance with subsection 200(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’), I consent to the withdrawal of the application. THE APPLICATION FOR WILFUL OR NEGLIGENT DAMAGE 11. The Landlord served the Tenants with a notice of termination which says that the Tenants wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit contrary to subsection 62(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). The Landlord is also seeking monetary compensation for the alleged damage pursuant to section 89 of the Act. 12. As I pointed out at the hearing, the notice of termination and the claim for compensation do not contain specific dates, times or details regarding the Tenants’ alleged behaviour. 13. The notice of termination fails to comply with subsection 43(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') which says that a notice of termination given by a landlord to a tenant must set out the reasons and details for the notice. 14. In addition, the Divisional Court’s decision in Ball v. Metro Capital Property, [2002] O.J. No. 5931 stands for the proposition that the kinds of particulars that should be contained in a notice which is about a tenant’s behaviour should include “dates and times of the alleged offensive conduct together with a detailed description of the alleged conduct engaged in by the tenant”. As I explained to the Landlord, the notice here does not meet this requirement. 15. I also explained that the Tenants have the right to know the allegations before the hearing so they can be prepared to defend the application. For these reasons, I find that the notice of termination served on the Tenant pursuant to s. 62 of the Act fails to meet the mandatory requirements of the Act. The Landlord’s application based on subsection 62(1) of the Act and section 89 of the Act must therefore be dismissed. THE APPLICATION FOR OVERCROWDING 16. Subsection 67(1) of the Act says “a landlord may give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy if the number of persons occupying the rental unit on a continuing basis results in a contravention of health, safety or housing standards required by law.” 17. The Landlord served the Tenants with a notice of termination which alleges that there are six children living in the rental unit. At the hearing, the Landlord’s representative was unable to provide the Board with any by-law which prohibits the Tenants from having six children living in the rental unit. 18.

       " 'The Board has granted relief in the form of two separate conditional pay on time orders in the past and each time the Tenant has promised to pay rent on time into the future and to rearrange his financial affairs to ensure that happens. And yet that clearly has not worked. Under the circumstances, the only conclusion I can come to is that for whatever reason the Tenant does not take his obligation to pay rent on time seriously. In other words, granting relief in the form of yet another pay on time order will likely not change what appears to be a set pattern. As a result, an order shall issue terminating the tenancy for persistent late payment of rent. 22. That being said, if the Tenant pays off the rent arrears owing for the period ending December 31, 2018, it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until January 31, 2019. Given the time of year, the presence of two children in the unit, one of whom who has just been through a mental health crisis, the length of the tenancy, and the difficult market conditions, it seems to me that if the arrears are paid this delay would not be unfair in all of the circumstances. The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,010.00 from the Tenant and this deposit shall be applied to the rent due for the month of January, 2019. 23. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 19, 2013 to December 31, 2018 totalling $90.61. This amount shall be applied to first top up the deposit to the lawful monthly rent of $1,028.18; the remainder shall be applied to the rent arrears owing. 24. If the Tenant does not move out on or before January 31, 2019, the eviction may be enforced through the Court Enforcement Office and daily compensation shall also become due and owing for the period starting February 1, 2019. 25.

APPLICATION FOR WILFUL DAMAGE 5. The Landlord served the Tenants with a notice of termination under section 63 of the Act because the Landlord believes the Tenants wilfully damaged the rental unit. 6. At the hearing, the Landlord submitted pictures of holes in walls, damaged carpet, garbage bags in various rooms, vice grips used to turn the shower on and off, and general pictures of the mess and dirt in the rental unit. 7. Simply presenting these pictures does not prove wilful damage. As I stated at the hearing, can the Landlord tell me whether this damage was done due to accidents or did the Tenants purposefully damage the property? The Landlord could not provide the Board with evidence to show the damage was done on purpose. 8. As a result, the Landlord’s application for eviction based on wilful damage is dismissed. SECTION 89 DAMAGE CLAIM 9. Section 89 states that a landlord may apply to the Board if the tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person whom the tenant permits in the residential complex wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to the rental unit. 10. In the pictures provided, it is evident the damage in the rental unit is beyond normal wear and tear expected. 11. The Landlord will incur costs of $3,500.00 to repair the damage and/or replace property that was damaged and cannot be repaired. 12. As a result, the Landlord’s damage claim is granted. 13.

       " \"The order says in part: 6. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). The Tenant has lived in the rental unit since April 2018, with his 10 year old son who has a respiratory condition. The Tenant says that he was working as an independent contractor when he moved into the rental unit. However, the customer he was working for refused to pay him thousands of dollars for his work and insisted that the Tenant take her to court to recover those funds. In support of his testimony, the Tenant showed the Board a text message on his phone in which he sent an invoice to the customer and she responds “see you in court”. 7. The Tenant says he then spent several weeks trying to find more stable work and was able to find employment in a unionized construction position. The Tenant says he is now working for an hourly wage and his employment is stable. In support of his position, the Tenant showed the Board a copy of a paystub on his phone which indicates that he is working a unionized job and making a steady income. 8. The Tenant is seeking relief in the form of a payment plan. Based on the Tenant’s current monthly income and expenses, I am satisfied that he can afford to make payments towards a payment plan and pay his rent in full and on time, subject to the Landlord’s right to file an application to terminate the tenancy in the event of a breach. For these reasons, I find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. 6. The repayment plan the Board ordered was proposed by the Tenant. 7. The Tenant says he missed the deadline by one day because he did not realise November 15, 2018 was a Thursday. He gets paid every Friday. 8. But the Tenant also did not pay December’s rent on time as required by the order. 9. The Tenant says he failed to pay December’s rent on time because he received his paycheque late. As I understand it, the Tenant is sent to various job sites and his paycheque is available for pick up at a site where he was not working that week. When he did not pick up his paycheque it was mailed to him. 10. But the Tenant also says that a month ago he got a second job doing renovations in the evenings. The Tenant says that this second job has allowed him to get back on track. As I pointed out at the hearing, that statement does not actually appear to be true as the Tenant failed to pay December’s rent on time which was due after he got this second job working evenings. The Tenant says he had other bills to take care of. 11. The monthly rent here is $1,233.00. The Tenant presented no evidence as to how much he actually makes or what his other monthly expenses are. 12. Neither party produced any corroborating documentation. 13. In response to my question, the Tenant acknowledged that he has a history of late and non-payment that has led to applications before the Board with respect to his prior tenancy. The Board’s records indicate that between 2011 and 2017 there were 14 applications to the Board with respect to the Tenants’ previous tenancy for non-payment of rent, persistent late payment, and because the Tenants breached consent orders or mediated agreements. Somewhat surprisingly, this Landlord was also the Landlord with respect to that previous tenancy. 14. So the question for the Board is whether or not it would be unfair in all of the circumstances to permit the tenancy to continue. 15. The problem with the Tenants’ motion is that the evidence indicates that the Tenant is either unable or unwilling to meet his financial obligation to the Landlord to pay rent on time and in full. It is unclear from the Tenant’s evidence if that is because his income is insufficient to meet his expenses, or if it is because he spends his money on other things, or if it is because he cannot manage his finances to ensure he has the funds he needs to make payment when it is due. But there is nothing in the evidence before the Board that suggests the Tenant is able to comply with his own repayment plan. . It seems inevitable that permitting the tenancy to continue would simply result in additional legal proceedings in the future. 16. Given all of the above, I am not satisfied that it would not be unfair to grant the Tenant’s motion. As a result, the motion must be denied. 17. So the final issue before the Board is with respect to the timing of the lifting of the stay. The Tenant says it will take him two months to find a new place and move but he has not yet started looking. The Landlord is willing to delay the lifting of the stay until December 31, 2018 due to the holiday season. 18. Given that the arrears of rent now stand at $4,431.00 delaying the eviction for an additional two months would be unduly prejudicial to the Landlord. It seems to me that the reasonable thing to do would be to lift the stay effective January 7, 2019. That would give the Tenant sufficient time to figure out what he is going to do without unduly prejudicing the Landlord’s interests. 19. This order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued\",\n",
       " 'No written notice was given in accordance with s. 27 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). 20. This announcement was problematic for the Tenant because the furnace installation included running vents or ductwork up to the second floor on the east side of the house. And that involved moving furniture. The Landlord knew this as he had spoken to the Tenant about it before. The Tenant and the Tenant’s Spouse had asked for a week’s notice. 21. It was also problematic because there were tenants in the in-law suite who needed 24 hour’s notice as well. 22. So the Tenant and the Tenant’s Spouse made phone calls and it was agreed that the furnace installers would attend on September 26, 2018 as planned but only to do the work required in the basement. They would return on September 28, 2018 to do the work on the upper levels. 23. On September 26, 2018 the Tenant’s Spouse walked into the house and discovered workers on a ladder in the living room on the main floor. They were tearing down a part of the ceiling to install the ductwork and debris was falling on top of a bookcase containing glassware and the Tenant’s medical supplies. 24. She stopped them and started trying to move furniture around. 25. Her son was staying upstairs where a queen-sized bed and a 55 inch TV with a glass stand had to be moved as well. She was not physically able to move it and the Tenant was recovering from surgery, so they had no choice but to call her son and ask him to leave work to come home and move furniture, which he did. 26. According to the Tenant’s Spouse some minor items went missing from the basement at this time. 27. On December 12, 2018, the Tenant received written notice of entry for “Monday morning until afternoon”. 28. The evidence is insufficient to establish this sequence of events is a breach of the privacy provisions of the Act contained in sections 25 to 27, but I am satisfied that on September 26, 2018 the Landlord breached section 22 of the Act. I say this for the following reasons. 29. There is no question that having a phone conversation to tell a tenant that furnace installers are coming the next day is not notice of entry in compliance with the Act. 30. However, s. 26(1)(b) says it is not a breach of the Act if the Tenant consents to the entry at the time the entry occurs. As the Tenant’s Spouse was not present when the furnace installers arrived and the Tenant did not testify, I do not know if the Tenant many any effort to refuse the entry in question. So the evidence is insufficient to establish a breach of s. 25 with respect to the furnace installation on September 26, 2018. 31. I agree with the Tenant that the notice of entry served on December 12, 2018 also does not meet the requirements for notice under section 27 in that it does not specify a date of entry or a comprehensible time of entry. 32. A limited range of hours may be acceptable for entry in some circumstances, but the particulars on a notice of entry must be sufficient to inform the tenant when they can expect someone in their home. For example, if the notice had said the technician will arrive between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. and be there for two hours that would be sufficiently specific for the tenant to know what to expect. 33. But the problem with the Tenant’s complaint with respect to the notice of entry served on December 12, 2018 is that no evidence was led as to whether or not the entry actually occurred. So although I agree the notice was improper, I cannot conclude there was an illegal entry. 34. But section 22 says: A landlord shall not at any time during a tenant’s occupancy of a rental unit and before the day on which an order evicting the tenant is executed substantially interfere with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or the residential complex in which it is located for all usual purposes by a tenant or members of his or her household. 35. The Landlord is responsible for the behaviour of the furnace installers on September 26, 2018, because they were there at his request and direction. They were acting with his authorization. 36. The Tenant’s Spouse says she and the Tenant were very upset at this sequence of events because they had talked to the Landlord and agreed that more notice to move the furniture was required and that agreement was not honoured. The average, reasonable tenant would feel the same way. 37. So I am satisfied that the unexpected upheaval that occurred on September 26, 2018 substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the Tenant and his household. 38. The issue of remedy is discussed below. Remarks About Low Rent 39. The Tenant’s Spouse says that on multiple occasions the Landlord has stated to the Tenant or a member of his household that people in the community keep asking why he charges such low rent. For example, this type of remark was made on September 20 and September 27, 2018. 40. On September 27, 2018 the son of the Tenant’s Spouse confronted the Landlord in response to a remark like this and asked who in the community was talking about the Tenant’s rent being low. It is not a topic the Tenant or the Tenant’s Spouse discuss publicly. At that point the Landlord indicated no one in the community was talking about the amount of rent charged; it was simply something he discusses with his spouse. 41. The Tenant’s Spouse says she and the Tenant found these kinds of remarks belittling. 42. I can understand why the Tenant and the Tenant’s Spouse felt these remarks were demeaning. Most people would find this kind of joking to be rude and unprofessional. But the issue before the Board is not whether the Landlord was rude and unprofessional, it is whether or not the remarks constitute a breach of ss. 22 or 23 of the Act. 43. In this instance, I am not satisfied that the Landlord breached the Act by making these remarks. The evidence indicates they were private remarks. The amount of rent the Tenants were paying was not the subject of gossip in the community. There is also no evidence to suggest that after the Landlord was confronted about making these kinds of remarks he continued to make them. 44. So although I accept the remarks caused the Tenant and his household some upset, I am not satisfied that the behaviour rises to the threshold of “substantial” interference in s. 22. And as the behaviour appears to have stopped after the Landlord was confronted about it, I am not satisfied it constitutes behaviour the Landlord knew or ought to have known would be most unwelcome to the Tenant and a breach of s. 23. The Lease, the Rent, and Demands the Tenant’s Spouse Move Out 45. On or about September 18, 2018 the Tenant’s spouse attempted to pay the Landlord the annual discounted rent of $10,000.00. 46. According to the Tenant’s Spouse the annual rent was $12,000.00 but the Tenant was entitled to a discount of $2,000.00 annually if the rent was paid in advance of the due date of October 1. 47. Initially the Landlord seemed pleased to receive the Tenant’s cheque but at some point thereafter he returned the payment and said he would not accept it until the Tenant had signed a new lease. He also wanted payment in cash. 48. On September 27, 2018, the Landlord presented the Tenant with a one-page handwritten document. It is essentially a proposal for terms for a life lease. It says the Landlord only wants to deal with the Tenant, the Tenant is to continue to be responsible for maintenance and repairs, the Tenant can terminate on 30 days’ notice, and after the Tenant’s death the remaining occupants can continue to reside in the rental unit until the later of 60 days after the death or the end of the annual period of the tenancy. 49. The Tenant and the Tenant’s Spouse understood these terms to mean that the Landlord did not want to deal with the Tenant’s Spouse, and if and when the Tenant passed away, she would be put out of her home. 50. The Tenant’s Spouse says that also on September 27, 2018 the Landlord pointed at the Tenant’s Spouse and said she could move out but the Tenant could stay. This kind of remark was made more than once. 51. I would observe at this point that none of the proposed terms in the handwritten document are actually legally enforceable. For example: • As the Tenant’s spouse holds power of attorney for property for her spouse, the Landlord has no right at all to refuse to deal with her. • Under s. 20(1) of the Act a landlord is responsible for maintenance and repairs. That obligation cannot be shifted by lease terms to a tenant. (See sections 3 and 4 of the Act.) • A tenancy like this one cannot be terminated on 30 days’ notice. Pursuant to s. 44(3), at least 60 days’ notice must be given and the date of termination must be the last day of the yearly period. • After a tenant’s death any surviving spouse living in the rental unit automatically becomes the tenant provided he or she does not voluntarily vacate within 30 days of the death. (See s. 3(1) of Ontario Regulation 516/06.) • Finally, after April of 2018 it became mandatory for all landlords to use the government’s standard lease form for all written tenancy agreements. 52. The Tenant’s Spouse says the Landlord kept pressuring the Tenant to sign this handwritten document but the Tenant was reluctant to do so. He wanted advice and he kept telling the Landlord that the Landlord could not force a new lease on the Tenant as he already had one. But the Landlord kept insisting and refusing to accept the rent until the Tenant acquiesced to the Landlord’s demands. 53. The Tenant and the Tenant’s Spouse made a second attempt to pay the rent in advance of the due date. On or about September 29, 2018 they sent a cheque by express post with receipt signature required. The Landlord refused to pick it up from the post office and eventually it was returned to the Tenant and the Tenant’s Spouse. 54. On October 4, 2018 the Landlord came to the door of the rental unit and told the Tenant and the Tenant’s Spouse that he did not need or want the rent and would have them evicted. He threatened to bring over a bull dozer and demolish the house. 55. The Tenant’s Spouse says that in addition to wanting the Tenant to sign a new lease, the Landlord refused the Tenant’s cheque because he wanted payment to be in cash. It appears the Landlord believed (erroneously) that the Tenant had always paid the Landlord’s father in cash so he wanted cash as well. The Tenant told the Landlord he was willing to pay in cash in exchange for a receipt but the Landlord refused to commit to providing a receipt. 56. The Tenant’s Spouse says that by that point she would get physically ill just seeing a pickup truck that looked like the Landlord’s. 57. The Tenant and the Tenant’s Spouse told the Landlord that they would not let him pressure them, they were going to seek legal advice and go to the Board. And on October 6, 2018 they served notice to terminate on the Landlord. According to the Tenant’s spouse, they could not stand the harassment anymore. 58. On or about October 7, 2018 the Tenant made a third attempt to pay the rent. The Tenant’s Spouse and one of her sons went to the Landlord’s home and placed cheques in his mail box. They were never cashed. Correspondence delivered with the cheques indicates the Tenant planned to vacate March 31, 2019 and would pay $1,000.00 monthly until then. 59. The Tenant did in fact move out, but not until September 30, 2019 which was the end of a period of the tenancy. 60. After October 7, 2018 the Tenant’s spouse became concerned because the cheques were not being cashed. Sometime in December of 2018, that concern prompted her to put a stop payment on them. 61. On or about December 11, 2018 the Landlord delivered a letter to the rental unit. It states in part the Landlord’s understanding that rent was payable in cash. The Tenant and the Tenant’s spouse showed the Landlord a copy of an old cancelled cheque to prove payment had been made by cheque in the past. 62. On December 12, 2018, the Landlord came to the property and told the Tenant he wanted the Tenant’s Spouse evicted. The Tenant subsequently reported this to the Tenant’s Spouse. 63. In December of 2018 the Landlord also presented the Tenant and the Tenant’s Spouse with a bill for rent for the period October 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019. The bill indicates the Landlord was demanding monthly rent calculated as one-twelfth of $10,000.00. It also indicates a rent increase was scheduled to take effect January 1, 2019 in the guideline amount of 1.8% even though a Notice of Rent Increase was not served on the Tenant. 64. On May 24, 2019, following proceedings at the Board, the Tenant tried again and tendered another cheque to the Landlord for a yearly period. This time it was in the amount of $12,000.00. The Landlord did not cash that cheque either. 65. This sequence of events concerning refusal to accept payment of rent, demands the Tenant sign a new lease, the threat to bulldoze the house and evict the Tenant, and remarks about the Tenant’s Spouse moving out without the Tenant, constitute a breach of section 23 of the Act. The reasonable landlord knows or ought to know that this kind of behaviour would be most unwelcome to the average reasonable tenant. 66. Again remedy is discussed below. The Water Supply Issue 67. In the spring of 2017, the Tenant was advised that the barn was going to be rented out to a sheep farmer for housing his sheep. 68. At the time this occurred the Tenant warned the Landlord and the farmer there would be water issues. And there were. Twice a day there would be no water for maybe 15 to 20 minutes. Sometimes water loss continued for up to an hour. This meant problems arose using the toilet, cooking, running the dishwasher or the washing machine. 69. The Tenant first complained about this prior to the final purchase of the farm by the Landlord and his spouse. 70. In June of 2018 the son of the Tenant’s Spouse was in the shower when the water supply stopped. The Tenant’s spouse sent a complaint to the Landlord and the Landlord started talking about installing another or additional well and some drilling was done. But the Landlord seemed to think he could demand additional monies from the Tenant in exchange for resolving the problem by adding a new well. The problem was not resolved. 71. Then on February 14, 2019 the Tenant’s Spouse sent another letter complaining about the problems caused by the interruption of the water supply. As far as she is aware nothing was done at that time. 72. Then in May of 2019 the Tenant’s Spouse spoke directly to the sheep farmer about the problem. At that point something must have been done because the problem with the water supply finally stopped. She is unaware of how the problem was resolved. 73. Because the evidence is insufficient to establish how the issue was resolved, I am not prepared to make a finding that the Landlord deliberately interfered with or withheld a vital service. That being said, having the water supply interrupted twice a day seven days a week is clearly a substantial interference with reasonable enjoyment and a breach of s. 22 of the Act. 74. Again, remedy is discussed below. Miscellaneous 75. Some evidence was led with respect to the occupants of the in-law suite. At some point in time the Tenant rented the in-law suite to the son of the Tenant’s Spouse and his spouse. 76. On September 27, 2018 the occupants of the in-law suite submitted a letter of complaint to the Tenant and the Tenant’s spouse complaining about the behaviour of the Landlord on his visits to the property. He was loud and attended the property frequently and without notice. 77. But the Tenant and the Tenant’s spouse did not report these complaints to the Landlord. 78. Subsequently, the son and spouse in question moved out and the in-law suite was rented out to another son of the Tenant’s Spouse. 79. This evidence is insufficient to make out a breach of the Act. The Landlord was unaware of the complaints so it cannot be said he knew or ought to have known his behaviour was unwelcome. The son and spouse in question did not testify so it is unclear as to the impact on them of the behaviour complained of and unclear whether or not it was the reason they decided to move out. 80. As a result, I am not prepared to find the behaviour in question constitutes substantial interference with reasonable enjoyment or harassment. Remedy 81. The application as filed seeks an abatement of the rent, a cease and desist order, and an administrative fine. At the hearing the request for remedies was narrowed to abatement of the rent and costs. 82. Abatement is a contractual remedy designed to address the idea that a tenant is paying for a bundle of goods and services and where the tenant is not receiving those goods and services rent should be abated proportional to the difference between what is being paid for and what is being received. 83. The Tenant is entitled to abatement of the rent for the upheaval caused by the furnace installation of September 26, 2018. That upheaval was not reasonable and could have been avoided. That being said, the disruption appears to have been limited to a single day. As the annual discounted rent is $10,000.00, a 100% abatement for that one day is only equal to $10,000.00 divided by 365 days or $27.40. That does not seem particularly reasonable in terms of a remedy but the Tenant did not seek damages arising from the breach so an order shall issue for $27.40. 84. With respect to the sequence of events concerning the Landlord’s demands that the Tenant sign a new lease, his refusals to accept payment, his threats to evict the Tenant and bulldoze the house, and his remarks about wanting the Tenant’s Spouse to move out, the Tenant is entitled to additional abatement of the rent. The behaviour can only be described as bullying. The Tenant and his household quite rightly felt threatened and intimidated and were driven to move out because of it. 85. The evidence suggests this behaviour occurred on and off over several days for the period commencing September 18, 2018 and seems to have waned by December of 2018. So I believe the Tenant is entitled to abatement for a three month period between September and December of 2018. Given all of the evidence before the Board and my knowledge of like similar cases, it seems to me a reasonable abatement of the rent would be about 25% of the rent charged or $625.00. That reflects the number of times the behaviour occurred, the egregiousness of the conduct in question, and some of the impact it had on the Tenant’s household. 86. With respect to the problem with the water supply, the starting period for abatement of the rent is March 5, 2018 because of the one year imitation period found in s. 29(2). As the problem was resolved sometime in May of 2019 I am satisfied the Tenant is entitled to abatement for approximately a fourteen month period. Given that the disruption in the water supply happened twice a day every day for the entire period, the timing and length of the disruptions was unpredictable but always during waking hours when cleaning and cooking could be anticipated, and given my knowledge of like similar cases before the Board, it seems to me that a reasonable abatement of the rent would be about 10% of the rent charged or $1,170.00. 87. The total of the abatements awarded above is $1,822.40 88. The Tenant incurred costs of $45.00 for filing the application and is entitled to reimbursement of those costs. 89. The Tenant also seeks costs of the adjournment of August 15, 2019. I do not believe such costs are warranted. The adjournment was necessary because the Board ran out of time. In part that was due to the difficulties the Landlord encountered in participating in the hearing process which I believe are at least partially related to his disability. Although I agree the Landlord’s behaviour on January 30, 2020 in walking out of the hearing room is behaviour that might draw an award of costs, those costs would logically flow to the Board and not the Tenant. And again, I believe the Landlord’s behaviour on January 30, 2020 is attributable at least in part to his disability. 90. So I do not believe costs for the adjournment should be ordered. 91. This order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued',\n",

At the hearing, the Tenants testified that they were able to pay the amount that they owe to the Landlord on or before April 20, 2018. Because this order is being issued on May 10, 2018, I find that it is not unfair to give the Tenants 11 days from the date of this order to pay the full amount they owe for the period ending May 31, 2018. 8. The Tenants shall be required to pay the amount they owe to the Landlord on or before May 21, 2018. The Tenants’ Application 9. The Tenants did not prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the Landlord failed to meet its maintenance obligations by failing to address the Tenants’ complaints of rodents, cockroaches and bed bugs. 10. At the hearing, the Tenants testified that they in fact did not complain to the Landlord of the presence of rodents, cockroaches and bed bugs after September 2016, when the Landlord treated the rental unit for pests and vermin. The Tenant DN explained that a friend who is a lawyer advised the Tenants not to complain to the Landlord about maintenance and repair issues at the rental unit. 11. Subsection 30(2) of the Act requires the Board to consider whether before filing an application about maintenance and repairs the tenant advised the landlord of the defects. In McQuestion v. Schneider, 1975 CanLII 764 (ON CA), [1975] O.J. No. 2279 (C.A.), the Court of Appeal for Ontario determined that a landlord is not liable for maintenance and repair defects, of which the landlord was not reasonably aware. 12. In this case, the Tenants agreed at the hearing that, because of the curious advice they received from a friend who is a lawyer, the Tenants did not inform the Landlord of maintenance and repair issues at the rental unit before filing their application with the Board. Therefore, following subsection 30(2) of the Act and the Court of Appeal for Ontario’s decision in McQuestion v. Schneider, I find that the Tenants did not prove that the Landlord failed to meet its maintenance obligations with respect to the presence of pests in the rental unit. 13. The Tenants did not prove that the Landlord failed to address the Tenants’ complaints about a shower leak. 14. The Tenants did not inform the Landlord of the leak until the Tenants filed their application with the Board in late-December 2017. The Tenant DN testified that the Landlord repaired the leak in or about January 2018 or February 2018. 15. The Tenants did not adduce evidence, or make a submission, that the time it took for the Landlord to repair the shower leak after receiving the Tenants’ T6 application was unreasonable. I therefore find that the Landlord responded in a timely manner when it learned of the leaking shower. Accordingly, the Landlord did not fail to meet its duty to maintain and repair the leaking shower. 16. DN testified that the Landlord addressed an issue with the furnace on the same day that the Tenants made their complaint to the Landlord. The Landlord therefore met its duty to maintain and repair the furnace. 17. DN similarly testified that the Landlord repaired a closet door after the Landlord became aware of the issue. DN could not, however, recall the dates when she informed the Landlord of the issue, or when the Landlord did the repair work. 18. The Tenants did not prove that the Landlord failed to respond to the Tenants’ complaints of the possible presence of mould at the rental unit. DN could not recall at the hearing when, or if, the Tenants advised the Landlord of their concerns about the possible presence of mould in the rental unit. The Landlord, therefore, was not reasonably aware of any potential mould issue at the rental unit. 19. The Tenants did not prove that stovetop burners do not function. DN agreed at the hearing that the Tenants have not tried to use the burners since approximately July 26, 2016, after the Landlord had performed maintenance work on the stove. The Tenants, therefore, do not know whether the burners function or not. 20. The Tenants did not prove that the Landlord failed to comply with a property standard by failing to finish wall repairs by painting the affected areas in a colour that is compatible with the rest of the walls. 21. The C of T Property Standards by-law requires repairs and maintenance work to be done in a manner such that the materials used (including paint) reasonably match adjoining decorative finishing materials. I interpret this requirement to include wall paint. That is, I find that the C of T Property Standards by-law requires landlords to paint walls in a matching colour, when it is reasonably possible to do so. 22. At the hearing, the Tenants adduced evidence that the Landlord was required to put holes in walls to resolve a leak. Although the Landlord repaired the surface of the walls, the Landlord did not paint the areas affected by the work in a colour that matches the surrounding areas. The Landlord finished its work on the rental unit’s walls by leaving the affected areas white. At some time during the tenancy, however, the Tenants painted the rental unit’s walls pink. 23. At the hearing, the Tenants testified that a former superintendent, who is no longer employed by the Landlord, gave verbal permission to the Tenants to paint the rental unit pink. Even if, however, the Tenants had the Landlord’s superintendent’s permission to paint the walls pink, I find that it would be unreasonable under the circumstances to order the Landlord to try to match the wall colour. 24. I therefore conclude that the Landlord did not fail to meet a property standard when the Landlord did not finish its wall repairs in a shade of pink that matches the rest of the rental unit. 25. The Tenants did not prove that the Landlord, or the Landlord’s agent or superintendent, harassed, coerced, obstructed, threatened or interfered with the Tenant, or a member of the Tenant’s household, by asking the Tenants to remove empty beer bottles from the Tenants’ yard. 26. DN’s evidence of the superintendent SR’s attempts to communicate with the Tenants via text message and telephone calls was vague. DN was not able to reliably recall the number of text messages and telephone calls SR made, and was also not able to recall the approximate dates of the text messages and telephone calls. Furthermore, there was no evidence to determine that the content of the text messages or telephone calls was inappropriate or unreasonable. 27. I therefore find that the Tenants did not adduce reliable evidence of harassment, coercion, obstruction, threats or interference from the Landlord’s superintendent. 28. Because the Tenants did not prove that the Landlord failed to meet its maintenance obligations under the Act, and also did not prove that the Landlord’s superintendent harassed, coerced, obstructed, threatened or interfered with the Tenant, or a member of the Tenant’s household, the Tenants’ application must be dismissed\",\n",

       " \"As at the date of the hearing the unpaid rent was $11,750.00 up to July 27, 2018. 9. At the hearing the Tenant’s husband claimed that rent for 15 months had been prepaid on August 2, 2016. In support of this assertion he produced a photocopy of a Bank of Montreal draft in the amount of $35,250.00 with the name of the Landlord’s husband handwritten in as the payee. 10. The Landlord’s husband denied the assertion made by the Tenant’s husband. It appears that the parties and their spouses were neighbours and friends in the past, and that the Landlord’s husband and the Tenant’s husband had a variety of business and other financial transactions between themselves. 11. The Landlord’s husband gave evidence that if the photocopy of the bank draft was genuine and if it represented a payment to him by the Tenant’s husband, that was in relation to a different business transaction, having nothing to do with the tenancy and the rent payable under the lease agreement. 12. I find that there was not a pre-payment of rent as alleged by the Tenant’s husband. The lease agreement and the addendum make no reference to any prepaid rent, and in fact make it clear that rent was to be paid monthly for the duration of the lease. Moreover, the Landlord under the lease agreement is the wife of YH, the alleged payee of the bank draft. 13. The Tenant’s husband’s assertion of prepayment for 15 months of rent makes no sense in the circumstances. The term of the lease was 27 months, with a last month rent deposit in place. Thus 26 months of rent would be payable under the terms of the lease. If 15 months were prepaid as alleged, then only 11 months would have been payable from July 28, 2016 before the prepayment would take effect. Thus the prepayment period would have begun on June 28, 2017, not on January 28, 2018 which is when the Tenant stopped paying rent. 14. I find that the Tenant has not paid the total rent she was required to pay for the period from January 28, 2018 to July 27, 2018. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination. 15. The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $2,350.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord. 16. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 29, 2016 to July 31, 2018. 17. I invited the Tenant’s representative to make submissions pursuant to S. 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). His submissions were, in essence, that I should refuse to grant eviction by reason of the alleged pre-payment of rent. There was no payment plan suggested concerning repayment of the arrears, nor was any delay of eviction requested. 18.

Although the Tenants asked that the eviction be postponed until September 30, 2018, I find that doing so will only cause additional rental arrears to accrue. This would result in unfairness to the Landlord. However, because the Landlord is holding a last month’s rental deposit, I find that it is not unfair to postpone the eviction date by 30 days.

At the hearing, the Tenant’s representative requested relief from eviction. The Tenant adduced evidence that she is a person with a disability. The Tenant also testified that her financial circumstances have changed. The Tenant’s son, and another roommate, will occupy the other two bedrooms at the rental unit. The three residents will each contribute to the monthly rent for the rental property. 8. The Landlord’s representative opposed relief from eviction. The Landlord’s representative adduced evidence of a previous application to the Board because of the Tenant’s failure to pay the rent she was required to pay. Since this proceeding was the second in as many years, the Landlord’s representative submitted that it would be unfair to grant further relief from eviction. The Landlord’s representative submitted that the business of being a landlord requires that landlords be able to reliably collect rent as it becomes due and payable. 9. I certainly appreciate the Landlord’s representative’s position. Landlords are, indeed, entitled to collect rent as it becomes due and payable. If a tenant does not pay rent in full and on time, the landlord is exposed to financial losses. 10. However, the Act, like all legislation in the Province of Ontario, is remedial. In Matthews v. Algoma Timberlakes Corp., 2010 ONCA 468 (CanLII), [2010] O.J. No. 2710 (C.A.), the Court of Appeal for Ontario ruled, at paragraph 22: “Given the remedial nature of the Act, its provisions must be interpreted liberally to ensure the realization of its objectives.” At paragraph 32, the Court of Appeal concluded: “The purpose of the legislation is to provide protections to tenants.” 11. The Court of Appeal for Ontario’s reasons in Matthews v. Algoma Timberlakes Corp. is consistent with earlier decisions by the Court, and by the Divisional Court, that the purpose of landlord and tenant legislation is to promote security of tenure. 12. I therefore find that, as the Divisional Court determined in Sutherland v. Lamontagne, [2008] O.J. No. 5763 (Div. Ct.), terminating a tenancy and evicting a tenant from a rental unit is a remedy of last resort. 13. In this case, the Tenant adduced evidence of a change in her circumstances, which change will promote prompt and regular payment of the monthly rent and the Tenant’s rental arrears. I therefore find that it is not unfair to issue a conditional order that reflects the payment plan the Tenant proposed at the hearing. 14.

The Tenant asked for three months to move out of the unit. The Landlord submitted that three months is too long and requested that the Tenant move out within eleven days. 14. I considered that this is not a lengthy tenancy and the Tenant is in arrears of rent and a delay of three months would more likely than not mean the Tenant will fall further into arrears.

I also considered that the Tenant had funds available and did not pay even a token amount toward the arrears. The Tenant was recently before the Board on arrears in March 2018, and it seems to me that the Tenant is having financial difficulties sustaining this tenancy. 11. The Tenant requested until December 2018 to move out of the unit. I considered that the Tenant has lived in the unit since 2013. However, the Tenant is substantial arrears and now owes the Landlord over $5,000.00.

This was a difficult proceeding over which to preside. The simple truth is that both the Landlord and the Tenant are experiencing personal financial difficulty. 8. The Landlord has invested his life’s savings into purchasing the rental unit, and relies on rental income to pay the mortgage and other costs associated with the unit. The Landlord also testified that the rental income is the Landlord’s primary source of income. 9. The Tenant is also enduring financial hardship. 10. The Tenant and her young child are survivors of domestic violence. Because of the trauma the Tenant experienced, the Tenant is currently unable to earn employment income. Instead, the Tenant receives income support benefits under the Ontario Disability Support Program (‘ODSP’). 11. It is evident that the rental unit’s affordability is an issue in this case. 12. The Tenant testified that she intends to vacate the rental unit on or before September 30, 2018. The Landlord testified at the hearing that he does not oppose terminating the tenancy on September 30, 2018. The tenancy shall therefore be terminated on that date. 13. However, I accept the Landlord’s evidence of the hardship he will continue to experience because of the Tenant’s rental arrears. 14. At the hearing, the Tenant testified that she is able to pay two months’ rent to the Landlord to reduce the amount that she owes. Under the circumstances, I find it is not unfair to order the Tenant to pay two months’ rent, or $3,050.00, to the Landlord within 11 days. If the Tenant does not make this payment in full and on time, the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Act to terminate the tenancy before September 30, 2018\",\n",

The Tenant attempted to argue that the rent is $1,450.00, and that is why there has been a shortfall of $300.00 every month for almost two years. However, the Landlord presented an order of this Board, TNT- 93514-17, dated March 1, 2018, in which the Tenants argued that there was an illegal rent increase. The Board concluded that the lawful rent was $1,750.00, pursuant to subsection 123(1) of the Act, in which a landlord may increase the rent charged to a tenant if the tenant and landlord agree that the landlord will add a prescribed service. The Landlord took over all the costs of paying utilities for the rental unit. In order TNT- 93514-17, the Member compared utilities costs over a period of two years, and found that the rent increase of $350.00, agreed to by both parties, was completely proper. This decision was reviewed, in order TNT-93514-17RV, and the Member found no error in the determination of rent. Therefore, I find the Tenants agreed to the rent increase almost four years ago, and they even have an order from the Board, from almost five months ago, that should have left them with no doubt what the lawful rent is. I find that the Tenants owe the amount of arrears claimed by the Landlord.

The Tenant did not propose a payment plan to pay down the arrears besides hypothetical income that he might have in mid-October when the arrears will have increased.

I considered the Tenants’ payment plan and it would take the Tenants over 9 months to pay the arrears. I am not of the view that the Landlord should have to wait for 5 months (if the Tenants get funds from the rent bank) to 9 months for the arrears to be paid in full. I also considered that the Tenants cannot pay the rent when due on the 1st of the month. 13.

At the hearing, the Tenant requested relief from eviction. The Tenant occupies the rental unit with his adult son, who is a person with a mental health disability. The Tenant testified that his son’s disability has resulted in several suicide attempts. The Tenant himself has been diagnosed with cancer. The Tenant testified that he has set up a separate banking account that will better enable him to make timely rental payments. 5. The Landlord opposed relief from eviction. The Landlord has had trouble paying the mortgage and other financial obligations because of the Tenant’s late payment history. 6. I sympathize with both parties. Landlords are entitled to collect rent as it becomes due and payable. Without regular rental income, many small, independent landlords may experience financial hardship. The Act, however, is remedial legislation, and the courts have determined that evicting a tenant is a remedy of last resort: Sutherland v. Lamontagne, [2008] O.J. No. 5763 (Div. Ct.). 7. Since this application is the first the Landlord has brought against the Tenant for issues relating to rent, and also taking into consideration the Tenant’s household’s circumstances, I find that it is not unfair to grant relief from eviction, and to issue a conditional order requiring the Tenant to pay the rent on time. 8. Since this order is being issued on November 6, 2018, the Tenant shall be required to pay rent to the Landlord for November 2018 no later than November 13, 2018. The Tenant shall be required to pay rent on the first day of each month thereafter for a period of 11 months (December 1, 2018 to October 1, 2019). If the Tenant fails to make any of these rental payments in full and on time, the Landlord shall have the right to apply to the Board for an eviction order against the Tenant, without notice to the Tenant. The Landlord must start such an application within 30 days of the Tenant’s failure to make a timely rental payment. 9. The Tenant shall also pay the Landlord’s Board filing costs',\n",

At the hearing, the Tenant requested relief from eviction. The Tenant testified that he will pay the rent on time, starting February 1, 2020. 7. I find, however, that the Tenant’s evidence of his potential income from two jobs is not reliable. The Tenant was not able to give a reasonably accurate estimate of his income from a part-time job with a friend’s courier business; and evidence that the Tenant started working at a full-time job on January 14, 2020 is inconsistent with his evidence that he will be able to pay the arrears he owes to the Landlord for the period ending January 31, 2020 and the full rent on February 1, 2020. 8. The Tenant’s evidence that he expects to receive payment from a $3,000.00 loan he made to a friend in 2017 is also not reliable. Although the Tenant asserted that his friend is able to repay the loan at this time, there was no reliable evidence of the debtor’s financial circumstances to determine that the Tenant will receive the payment in the near future. 9.

Indeed, the Landlord adduced evidence that this present application is the Landlord’s ninth application to the Board for matters related to rent. 11.

At the hearing, the Tenant MT requested relief from eviction in the form of a payment plan. MT testified that the Tenants can pay to the Landlord $150.00 a month toward the amount they owe. The Tenants therefore requested approximately three years to pay the amount they owe to the Landlord. 6. MT testified that her income is approximately $800.00 a month from the ODSP. The other Tenant contributes $500.00 a month toward the rent, and MT’s father, who resides with the Tenants, receives approximately $1,300.00 a month in OAS payments. MT also testified that she receives $300.00 a month under the CCTB, but these payments will soon end, as her child will turn 18 years-old this year. 7. The Tenants’ household monthly income, without the CTB, is therefore approximately $2,600.00. 8. At the hearing, the Landlord’s representative submitted that the Tenants’ household income will permit the Tenants to pay the amount they owe within two years. The Landlord’s representative therefore submitted that it would not be unfair under the circumstances to issue a conditional order requiring full payment within two years; not three. 9. I agree with the Landlord’s representative that the Tenants’ household income should permit the Tenants to pay the amount they owe within two years. The monthly rent of $724.00 represents less than 30 percent of the Tenants’ household income. The rent is therefore affordable according to CMHC guidelines. Accordingly, I find that it is not unfair to grant the conditional order the Landlord’s representative described at the hearing. 10. However, I also find that it is not unfair to postpone the first payment until April 1, 2020.

At the hearing, the Tenant testified that she began to accrue rent arrears because of other expenses. The Tenant’s evidence on those expenses, and why she elected to pay those expenses before paying rent to the Landlord, was vague. The Tenant only explained that she experienced a “bump” in her monthly costs, without further detail. 8. The Tenant, however, also testified that the expenses that contributed to her rent arrears have been paid. 9. The Tenant gave evidence that her monthly household income is approximately $2,900.00. The Tenant also receives a rent supplement to help pay the rent. 10. The Tenant’s evidence shows that the rental unit is affordable. Although the Tenant was not forthcoming in terms of explaining the “bump” in her household costs, I find that evidence of her income and normal monthly expenses is credible. 11. The Tenant requested relief from eviction in the form of a payment plan. The Tenant testified that she is able to pay $600.00 a month toward her arrears, beginning on March 16, 2020. 12.

In arriving at this decision, I am mindful of the Landlord’s representative’s able submission that issuing a conditional order may impose additional legal and administrative duties on the Landlord. The Act, however, certainly permits the Board to issue conditional orders where the Board considers it appropriate to do so. 15. I am also mindful of the current length of time it takes for the Board to hear and determine a matter, including a set aside motion under section 78 of the Act. This is a matter for the Board to address and is exogenous to the issues raised during the proceedings.

Because the Landlord was not successful in obtaining an order which allows the relief he asked for or substantially all of that relief (Guideline 3 of the Board’s Interpretation Guidelines), and because of my findings in relation to the Tenant’s application for harassment, I decline to order the Tenant to pay the Landlord’s application filing fee. The Tenant’s T2 application for harassment and substantial interference 10. The Tenant claims that the Landlord brought the L2 application because the Landlord wants to evict the Tenant because the Landlord believes that the rent paid by the Tenant is below current market value as a result of the long duration of the tenancy, and the Landlord wants to substantially raise the rent for the rental unit. The Tenant testified that the Landlord increased his rent from $700 when the Landlord purchased the building (which is denied by the Landlord). The Tenant states that the Landlord repeatedly pressures him to agree to raise the rent from the $980.00 presently being paid by the Tenant to $1,300.00. Although the Tenant was unable to provide specific dates of such requests, he testified that they are made every time the Landlord sees him. The Tenant responds to such requests by saying that a small increase would be acceptable, but such a large increase would not be manageable. 11. The Landlord denied making those requests of the Tenant, and testified that he had not attempted to raise the rent at all since becoming the Landlord in 2011. The Tenant then produced a letter from the Landlord dated May 11, 2013 addressed to the tenants of the residential complex referring to notices of rent increase given by the Landlord purporting to increase the rent by 3.5% as of June 1, 2013. This would have been an illegal increase because it was for more than the guideline amount permitted by the Act, and there is no evidence that an order had been made by the Board authorizing an above guideline increase. The Landlord responded by saying that the increase had not been implemented. Even if that is true, it is inconsistent with the Landlord’s previous evidence, and it also supports the Tenant’s testimony that the Landlord wants to increase the rents in the building, even if by means not authorized by the Act. 12. I also find support for the Tenant’s evidence in the position taken by the Landlord as to the remedy requested by the Landlord for the Tenant’s persistent late payment of rent. The Landlord is entitled to insist upon a contractual right to the payment of rent on time. However, given the very lengthy tenancy, the absence of any prior applications to the Board, and the fact that the payments, although late, were frequently late by only two or three days, and, for at least the previous year, were always made in full before the middle of the month, this is an obvious case for an order requiring timely rent payments going forward. Instead, the Landlord continued to ask for termination of the tenancy, from which I infer that his objective was to terminate the tenancy rather than to have the rent paid on time. The Landlord is entitled to seek termination of the tenancy as authorized by the Act, but I find that his choice to do so in this case and to persist in that position throughout the hearing supports the Tenant’s evidence about the Landlord’s attempts to increase the rent. 13. On the evidence before me, I prefer the testimony of the Tenant and find on a balance of probabilities that the Landlord has repeatedly harassed the Tenant and substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenant by pressuring and coercing him to agree to an above guideline increase in violation of the Act, and that the Landlord’s L2 application was brought in furtherance of those attempts. 14. The Tenant also claimed that the Landlord was harassing him because the Landlord perceived that the Tenant was not supporting the Landlord in a dispute involving a previous tenant. The Tenant’s testimony about this issue was vague and confusing, and I find that the Tenant did not prove this allegation on a balance of probabilities. 15. The Tenant did not seek any financial remedy or compensation for the harassment by the Landlord. He asked only that the Landlord be ordered to stop harassing the Tenant. That order is appropriate and justified on the evidence before me\",\n",

The factors I took into consideration were the length of the tenancy (over 6years), the relatively small amount of arrears in each of the prior applications brought by the Landlord and the fact that the Tenant voided the orders within the allocated time.

Because the Tenants saved the money they were required to pay to the Landlord for rent, they agreed to pay the amount they owe to the Landlord within 11 days from the date of this order. The Tenants’ Application 8. The Tenants proved that the Landlord has failed to maintain the rental unit, or has failed to comply with health, safety, housing or maintenance standards. 9. The Tenants proved that there is a rodent infestation in the rental unit and residential complex. The Tenants adduced photographic evidence of mice in the rental unit. The Tenant AL gave evidence that the Tenants observed a mouse in the rental unit as recently as two days before the hearing date. The Tenants testified that they advised the Landlord of the presence of mice in the rental unit at the beginning of April 2018. 10. The Landlord’s superintendent gave the Tenants glue mouse traps after receiving the Tenants’ complaint. The Landlord also had a pest control technician attend at the property on May 14, 2018 and again on July 8, 2018. The Landlord also filled various cracks and holes throughout the rental unit on May 8, 2018 in an effort to prevent mice from entering into the rental unit. 11. The Tenants, however, testified that the Landlord’s efforts have not resolved the problem. The Tenants adduced evidence that other residents at the residential complex also complain of mice. Based on this evidence, I find that the residential complex, and not just the Tenants’ rental unit, is experiencing a problem with mice. 12. The Landlord’s representative did not have knowledge of the presence of mice at the rental unit or residential complex, or of the Landlord’s efforts to address the issue. The Landlord’s representative therefore did not adduce evidence to dispute, or otherwise challenge, the Tenant’s evidence of mice at the rental property. 13. I therefore find that the Tenants proved that the Landlord has not met its duty to maintain the rental unit and residential complex free of mice. 14. At the hearing, the Tenants requested an order requiring the Landlord to compensate them for personal property that was damaged by mice. The Tenants adduced evidence that mice damaged a new baby stroller. The cost to replace the baby stroller is $249.97, plus HST. The Tenants also testified that mice damaged approximately $50.00 worth of dried foods, and $30.00 in new clothing for the Tenants’ infant child. The Tenants testified that they disposed of their toaster, because it had become contaminated with mouse droppings. The Tenants estimated that their costs to replace the toaster will be $30.00. 15. The Landlord’s representative conceded that he did not have evidence to dispute, or otherwise challenge, the Tenants’ evidence of their costs to replace damaged items. I therefore accept the Tenants’ evidence of their replacement costs, and find that their estimates are reasonable. The Landlord shall therefore be ordered to compensate the Tenants in the amount of $392.46 for property that was damaged by mice. The Tenants’ rental arrears shall be reduced by this amount, and by the Tenants’ $45.00 Board filing costs. 16. There shall also be an order requiring the Landlord to resolve the mouse infestation at the rental unit and residential complex. 17. The Tenants proved that the bathroom ceiling leaked approximately 18 times from August 3, 2018 to July 10, 2018. The Landlord, however, responded to the Tenants’ complaints by attending at the rental unit to help clean the bathroom, and by hiring a contractor to replace damaged drywall and the bathroom ceiling in May 8, 2018. 18. The Tenants testified that the last bathroom ceiling leak occurred on July 10, 2018. The Landlord responded to the Tenants’ complaint by speaking with the Tenants’ upstairs neighbour. The Tenants testified that they do not know what the Landlord discussed with the upstairs neighbour, but agreed that there has not been a bathroom ceiling leak since July 10. 19. The Tenants testified that they were advised in April 2018 that the likely cause of the bathroom ceiling leak is the upstairs neighbour’s children, who splash water when they take a bath. The upstairs unit’s bathroom is located directly above the Tenants’ bathroom. The Tenants also testified that the Landlord’s plumber inspected the rental unit on May 8, 2018. The Landlord’s plumber did not find any defect or other issue with the unit’s plumbing system. 20. Based on the Tenants’ own evidence, I find that it is more likely than not that the bathroom ceiling leaks were caused by the Tenants’ upstairs neighbour. Although I do not doubt that the Tenants were inconvenienced by the number of leaks, their evidence shows that the Landlord responded to their complaints. The Landlord repaired minor water damage to the bathroom, and also resolved the problem by speaking with the Tenants’ upstairs neighbour. 21. I therefore find that the Tenants did not prove that the Landlord failed to meet its obligations with respect to the bathroom ceiling leak. 22. The Tenants also did not prove that the Landlord failed to address water leaks and flooding in the Tenants’ bedroom. 23. At the hearing, the Tenants testified that they returned to the rental unit on April 6, 2018 to find that their bedroom had been flooded with water. The Tenants submitted an April 6, 2018 photograph showing water on their bedroom floor. The Tenants told the Landlord of the problem, and the Landlord arrived at the rental unit within 10 minutes to help clean the bedroom. 24. The bedroom leak recurred approximately 10 times between April 6, 2018 and June 2018. There was, however, no reliable evidence adduced at the hearing of when and how often the Tenants advised the Landlord of water leaks or of flooding after April 6, 2018. Nevertheless, the Landlord did have a contractor attend at the unit on July 6, 2018. The contractor was not able to identify the cause of the routine bedroom flooding. The Tenants also did not know the cause of the bedroom flooding. 25. The Tenants agreed that the last incident of leaks or flooding in their bedroom was in June 2018. 26. Under the circumstances, and based on the evidence adduced at the hearing, I find that the Landlord acted promptly upon receiving the Tenants’ complaint of the April 6, 2018 bedroom flood. I also find neither the Tenants nor the Landlord knows what caused the flooding between April 6, 2018 and June 2018, when the problem stopped. The Tenants, therefore, did not prove that the Landlord failed to meet its maintenance obligations with respect to bedroom flooding',\n",

L2 Application 8. The N5 notice of termination dated September 15, 2018 and filed in support of this application alleged that on August 15, 2018, the Tenant had up to 8 friends living in and occupying the empty bedrooms, overcrowding, stealing other tenants’ belongings, creating a mess, together with the presence of weapons heard of, and the presence of a vicious dog that bit people. 9. Additionally, the N5 also alleged that on September 2, 2018, the Tenant had three other friends living at the house, when he only has tenancy for one bedroom. These friends were overcrowding, squatting and using drugs, and further that, on September 14, 2018, the tenant’s friends moved into an empty bedroom in the house without paying for it, and there were reports of stealing, partying and fighting. 10. At the hearing, the Landlord did not have any witness, witness statements or affidavits, photographs, records of complaints, police reports or any reliable evidence to support the allegations in the N5. It is also the Landlord’s evidence that he does not reside at the residential complex. 11. Notwithstanding that the Tenant was not present to challenge the Landlord’s evidence, I am not satisfied that the Landlord has met his onus of proving his allegations in the N5 Notice on a balance of probabilities. 12. The Landlord also claimed that the N5 was not voided in the voiding period because he had attended the residential complex on August 15, 2018, between 9:00 AM and 1:00 PM to do household cleaning and observed the same behaviour. 13. However, the Certificate of Service indicates that the N5 was served on September 15, 2018, and the voiding period would be the 7 days following that service. The Landlord’s presence at the residential house on August 15, 2018 is not evidence that the N5 Notice was not voided. 14. I therefore do not find there is sufficient evidence that the N5 was not voided. 15. As a result, the Landlord’s L2 application shall be dismissed\",\n",

At the hearing the Landlord’s representative submitted photographs showing a substantial amount of damage to the unit and to the residential complex, including damaged windows (including the window to the laundry room), doors, floors (inside the unit and just outside the unit), light fixtures and walls. The Landlord’s representative testified that the unit was in pristine condition when the Tenants moved in, as was the floor just outside the unit. The Landlord’s representative testified that the laundry room window was damaged by the Tenants when they ran their extension cord into that room to get electricity. 10. At the hearing the Landlord’s representative submitted a copy of a quotation from a contractor stating that the cost to repair this damage is $7,819.73. 11.

L2 Application 6. The Landlord served the Tenant with an N5 Notice of Termination (‘N5 notice’) on January 4, 2019. The N5 notice indicates that the grounds for the notice are substantial interference. The N5 notice indicates that the Tenant may void the eviction by ceasing the behaviour complained of in the N5 notice in the seven days after the N5 notice is served. The voiding period is January 5, 2019 to January 11, 2019, inclusive. 7. The N5 notice sets out details as to the reason the Landlord has served the N5 notice. These details include that the Tenant harassed another tenant by calling him “mental,” and by leaving the water running in the shared washroom. 8. AD is an employee of the Landlord. At the hearing AD testified that to the best of his knowledge the allegations in the N5 notice are true. 9. At the hearing AD submitted a copy of a complaint from a tenant who lives on the floor beneath the shared washroom of the rental unit. The complaint is dated January 8, 2019 and states that on January 8, 2019 the tenant on the floor below noticed water leaking from his ceiling and that the cause of the leak is the water being left running in the sink in the shared bathroom above. The writer of the letter states that he knows it is the Tenant who has done this because the Tenant has a history of engaging in this behaviour. 10. Based on the Landlord’s uncontested evidence I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the Tenant ran the water excessively in the shared washroom on January 8, 2019 and that this behavior substantially interfered with another tenant. I therefore find that the Tenant did not void the N5 notice. 11. Based on the Landlord’s uncontested evidence I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the Tenant has engaged in the conduct complained of in the N5 notice. I therefore find that the Tenant has substantially interfered with another tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of the premises. 12.

L2 Application Interference with Reasonable Enjoyment 8. The Landlord served the Tenants with an N5 notice of termination (‘N5 notice’) by mail on January 14, 2019. Service was effective five days later, on January 19, 2019. The grounds for eviction in the notice are substantial interference with reasonable enjoyment. The termination date in the N5 notice is January 31, 2019. 9. A first N5 notice for termination for substantial interference must be served at least 20 days before the termination date in the notice. In this case, the N5 notice was served only 12 days before the termination date. Because the N5 notice was short-served, it is invalid. The tenancy cannot be terminated on the basis of this N5 notice. Demolishing the rental unit 10. The Landlord served the Tenants with an N13 notice of termination (‘N13 notice’) on January 14, 2019 by mail. Service was effective five days later, on January 19, 2019. The grounds for eviction in the N13 notice are that the Landlord intends to demolish the rental unit. The termination date in the N13 notice is May 31, 2019. 11. At the hearing the Landlord testified that he intends to demolish the rental unit, which is a house, and then build two houses on the land once occupied by the rental unit. The Landlord has taken most of the steps necessary to obtain a building/demolition permit for this work. At the hearing the Landlord submitted a letter and attached documents from the City of Toronto’s Committee of Adjustment showing that there is an outstanding issue with respect to a tree that must be removed for the work to proceed. These documents show that the Landlord’s application has been accepted pending the Landlord’s compliance with a condition. The Landlord testified that he intends to comply with this one condition within the next few weeks. It is clear from these documents that once the condition is met, the Landlord will have the permits that he needs to demolish the rental unit and build the new houses. 12. Based on the Landlord’s uncontested evidence, I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the Landlord requires the rental unit to be vacated in order to demolish it and that the Landlord has taken all reasonable steps to obtain the necessary permits for this work. Damage claim 13. In his application the Landlord claims compensation for undue damage to the rental unit. At the hearing the Landlord withdrew this claim\",\n",

L2 Application – Persistent Late Payment 8. On December 28, 2018, the Landlord served the Tenant a Notice to Terminate at End of the Term for persistent late payment of rent (the ‘N8 notice’) with a termination date of February 28, 2019. 9. The Tenant testified that he did not disagree with the Landlord’s schedule of late payments in the N8 notice. The Tenant testified that due to his pay schedule, he pays his monthly rent in 2 to 3 installments each month. As a result, his rent is not paid in full on the first of each month. Therefore, we find that the Tenant has persistently paid his rent late. 10. We have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) of the Act. Section 82 - Tenant Issues in Non-Payment of Rent Application 11. Pursuant to s. 82 of the Act, the Tenant raised both repair and maintenance issues in the rental unit and tenant rights issues. These issues may lead to an abatement of rent which would be set off against any arrears of rent owing to the Landlord. 12. The Tenant alleged that the Landlord harassed and interfered with his rights by: (1) illegal entries; (2) withholding vital services; (3) sending offending emails; and (4) the unauthorized use of his personal information. 13. The Tenant also alleged that he Landlord failed to maintain the residential unit in a good state of repair and fit for habitation and failed to comply with maintenance standards in relation to: (1) mold in the bathroom fan; (2) stove exhaust; (3) kitchen light fixture cover; (4) broken window lock; and (5) bathroom and kitchen plumbing/pipe flooding. T2 – Tenant Rights Illegal Entry 14. This claim arises as a result of the Landlord, or their agents, entering the boiler room of the residential complex, without prior notice to the Tenant. Specifically, the Tenant states that the Landlord entered the boiler room on October 19, 2018 and on February 25, 2019. The question before the Board is whether the Landlord was required to provide notice of entry pursuant to s. 27 of the Act, when entering or accessing the boiler room. 15. The Landlord and the Tenant dispute what areas are contained within, and form a part of, the Tenant’s rental unit. The Tenant stated that the boiler room is part of his rental unit. The Landlord disputes this assertion and states that the boiler room is part of the common arears of the complex and does not form part of the Tenant’s renal unit. Neither party submitted the rental agreement to clarify the boundaries of the Tenant’s rental unit. 16. The evidence before the Board was that the boiler room contains the residential complex’s boiler and other equipment. It is located between the Tenant’s rental unit and the shared laundry room and can be accessed through locked doors at either end, leading into the Tenant’s kitchen and on the opposite end into the shared laundry room. There are also shelves within the boiler room that both the Landlord and the Tenant store their property on. The Tenant testified that as his kitchen door provides entry into the boiler room it must constitute part of his unit. The Landlord testified that he maintains access to the boiler room as this is necessary for maintenance and repair issues for the boiler/equipment. Having considered the evidence of the parties we find the evidence of the Landlord to be more reasonable as the boiler room contains equipment that would require access by the Landlord on a regular basis. 17. We are satisfied that the boiler room does not form part of the Tenant’s rental unit for their exclusive use and is in fact a common area of the residential complex. The Landlord’s entry into the boiler room therefore does not constitute illegal entry into the Tenant’s rental unit. This claim is dismissed. Withholding of Vital Services 18. Pursuant to s. 21 of the Act, a Landlord is prohibited from withholding or deliberately interfering with the supply of vital services that it is obligated to supply under the tenancy agreement. Subsection 2(1) of the Act provides the definition of vital services, which includes the provision of heat to a rental unit between the months of September 1 to June 15 (section 4 of O.Reg. 516/06). The Tenant gave evidence that he had concerns regarding the temperature regulation in his unit, however, the complaint arose as a result of the rental unit being too hot. The Tenant did not provide evidence that his tenancy agreement contracted for the provision of air conditioning for his unit. As there are no provisions under the Act that require the Landlord to maintain the residential unit below a certain temperature or a provision requiring air conditioning, this claim is dismissed. Harassment and Substantial Interference with Reasonable Enjoyment 19. In the hearing, the Tenant stated that the Landlord harassed and interfered with the Tenant by sending offending emails and improperly disclosing his personal information. Section 23 of the Act states that the Landlord shall not harass, obstruct, coerce, threaten or interfere with a tenant. There is no definition of “harassment” in the Act, however prior Board decisions have defined it as follows: “harassment is usually considered to be a course of conduct that a reasonable person knows or ought to know would be unwelcome” (TST-62367-15). Offending Emails 20. The Tenant submitted several emails from the Landlord into evidence that the Tenant submitted were harassing and offending. The Landlord confirmed in the hearing that he had sent the emails and had done so out of frustration that the rent had not been paid. The Landlord sent the following emails to the Tenant: i. January 29, 2019 stating, “You really need to get a job”. ii. February 8, 2019, calling the Tenant a thief. iii. March 22, 2019, stating “I knew you were a criminal from the moment you cut those bushes and lied about it…” iv. April 3, 2019, stating “All of Canada is ashamed of your behavior”. v. May 4, 2019, stating “6 months now $7,200. You low life crook!!!” vi. May 18, 2019, stating “… You’re a nasty person” 21. The Tenant advised that he was upset by the tone and content of the emails, and that they were very disrespectful and hurtful. He advised that the allegations were untrue and offending as he was not a thief, a criminal nor a crook. 22. The Tenant requested a rent abatement as a result of the alleged harassment by the Landlord and that the Board order the Landlord stop the harassing behavior. 23. We find that the average and reasonable person would consider the comments made in the Landlord’s emails to be offending, demeaning and inappropriate and we accept the Tenant’s evidence that they had a negative impact on him. We are therefore satisfied that the Landlord breached s. 23 of the Act through these emails and that they amount to harassment of the Tenant. Use of Personal Information 24. The Tenant stated that the Landlord had recently contacted the individuals who the Tenant had used as references in his original tenancy application with the Landlord in 2017. The Tenant advised that on April 3, 2019, his references were contacted by the Landlord and they were informed that the Tenant was in arrears of rent and the amount of arrears owing. The Landlord confirmed that he had contacted the Tenant’s references as he felt that as references, they should assist him in convincing the Tenant to pay the rent owing. 25. The Landlord should not have disclosed information about the Tenant’s rental account to third parties. The Tenant’s payment history was personal information and pursuant to subsection 5(3) of the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, SC 2000, c. 5, should only be disclosed for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances. 26. The Landlord breached the Tenant’s privacy rights by sharing information about his payment history with third parties and he ought to have known that this was unreasonable as the Tenant’s references would not have a right to know of the Tenant’s debts or credit history. We find that the privacy breach interfered with the Tenant’s reasonable enjoyment. Conclusion and Remedy 27. The Tenant is entitled to an abatement of rent for the harassment and also for substantial interference. Based on the nature of these problems and the impact on the Tenant, we find that an appropriate amount for the harassing emails would be $250.00 and an appropriate amount for the substantial interference would be $500.00. Repair and Maintenance Claims 28. The Tenant alleged that the Landlord failed to conduct repairs in a timely manner and failed to maintain the unit in relation to: (1) mold in the bathroom fan; (2) stove exhaust vent; (3) kitchen light fixture cover; (4) broken window lock; and (5) bathroom and kitchen plumbing/pipe flooding. 29. Pursuant to section 20(1) of the Act a “landlord is responsible for providing and maintaining a residential complex, including the rental units in it, in a good state of repair and fit for habitation and for complying with health, safety, housing and maintenance standards.” Bathroom fan mold. 30. The Tenant alleged that there was black mold in the bathroom fan fixture and submitted photographs at the hearing in support of this claim. The photographs were unclear and did not show evidence of mold. The Landlord contested this claim and advised that he had attended the unit to inspect the fixture and there was no evidence of mold. Based on the photographs provided, we did not see any discoloration of any sort in the fan or evidence of mold and we find that the Tenant was unable to prove his claim for mold on the balance of probabilities. This claim is dismissed. Stove exhaust vent. 31. The Tenant alleged that there was an issue with the stove exhaust vent being open to the exterior of the unit, such that a baby bird was able to enter into his unit. The Tenant could not explain where, or if, there was an actual opening in the exhaust vent, but only that there would have been no other way for a bird to enter into his unit. The Landlord testified that there was a screen over the exhaust vent and as a result it would be impossible for a bird to enter through the venting system and into the unit. When asked if there was a screen over the exhaust vent, the Tenant advised that he did not know, that it could be possible. As the Tenant is uncertain how the bird entered his unit and whether or not the exhaust vent is secured, we find that he was unable to prove his claim on a balance of probabilities and this claim is therefore dismissed. Kitchen light fixture cover. 32. The Tenant alleged that the ceiling light fixture in the kitchen had a missing light fixture cover. He advised that the cover was not in place as it was broken and he had advised the Landlord and had asked for it to be repaired. The Landlord testified that he was aware that the light fixture cover was broken and had not repaired or replaced it. Based on the evidence before the Board, we find that the light fixture cover is broken. The Landlord will be ordered to replace the light fixture cover. Broken window lock. 33. The Tenant alleged that the unit’s window lock is either broken or is incapable of securing the window. The Tenant and the Landlord both agreed that in order to “better” secure the window, a piece of wood has been installed to hold the window shut. The Tenant advised that the insertion of the wood has not fully secured the window. Based on the evidence before the Board we are not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the window locking system is sufficient to secure the window. The Landlord will be ordered to install a window locking system that is sufficient to secure the window and if that is not possible with the current window system, the Landlord will be ordered to provide a secure window. Bathroom and kitchen plumbing/pipes flooding. 34. The Tenant alleged that there was a “pin hole” leak in the plumbing fixtures that run from the kitchen to the washroom. This leak caused water to flow within the ceiling and down a wall. The Tenant provided photographs that showed the leakage caused damage to paint on one wall and this leak was the cause of the damage to the light fixture cover in paragraph 34. The Landlord acknowledges that there was a leak that caused the issues listed above. The Landlord advised that he attended the unit and repaired the leak issues, with only the paint and light fixture as outstanding repair issues. Based on the information before the Board we find on a balance of probabilities that the leak caused a small area of paint to peel and that this took several months for the Landlord to repair. However, having viewed photographs of the affected area, we cannot find that this issue was of a sufficiently serious nature to warrant a remedy\",\n",
       " 'In her testimony, the Landlord acknowledged that she served the Tenants two other N4 Notices but she did so on a different day prior to February 26, 2019. The Landlord testified that the only N4 Notice she served on the Tenants on February 26, 2019 is the notice that forms the basis of this application with a termination date March 12, 2019.The Landlord testified that she served this N4 Notice on the Tenants in three different ways: by placing a copy under the door of the rental unit, leaving a copy with the concierge for the building and sending a copy by email to AS. The Landlord testified that she left the copies at the rental unit/residential complex at approximately 9:30 – 10:00 p.m. and she sent the email to AS later that night. 6. The Landlord presented a video at the hearing, taken by her husband’s cell phone, in which the Landlord is seen and heard saying the date: February 26, 2019. The Landlord knocks on the door of the rental unit a few times but there is no answer. The Landlord then says that she is placing an N4 Notice under the Tenants’ door. The Landlord can be seen putting an N4 Notice into an envelope and then crouching down toward the floor. The termination date of the N4 Notice cannot clearly be seen and the Landlord is not clearly seen slipping the envelope under the door. The Landlord’s husband, AAG, testified that he filmed this video on his phone and he witnessed the Landlord placing the envelope under the Tenants’ door. AAG also testified that the envelope contained the N4 Notice that is in the Board’s file. I note that the information on AAG’s phone indicates that the video was taken at 9:56 p.m. on February 26, 2019. 7. The Landlord also presented the email that she sent the Tenant at 11:32 p.m. on February 26, 2019 on her cell phone. The email has the N4 Notice with the March 12th termination date attached. 8. When I consider all of the evidence before me, I find that it is more likely than not that the Landlord served the Tenants with the N4 Notice at issue on February 26, 2019. The Landlord’s testimony about how and when she served the document is consistent with AAG’s testimony and with various other pieces of evidence – the video on AAG’s phone, the concierge’s records and the Landlord’s email to AS. The Landlord’s testimony is also consistent with the information in the certificate of service, which indicates that the Landlord served the N4 Notice on February 26, 2019 but placing the document under the Tenants’ door. 9. Although it is always a challenging task to prove a negative, like the Tenants’ claim that they did not receive the N4 Notice, the Landlord ultimately has the burden of proving that she served the N4 Notice in accordance with the Act. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the Landlord did in fact serve the N4 Notice on the Tenants and the method and timing of service complies with the Act. The hearing proceeded based on this determination. The Tenants owe the Landlord $8,590.00 10. The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from February 20, 2019 to June 19, 2019. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective March 12, 2019. 11. The tenancy started on January 20, 2018. The rent is due on the 20th day of each month. The rent is $2,100.00 per month. 12. The Landlord claims that the Tenants have not paid any rent since February 20, 2019 and the total amount owing is $8,590.00, including $8,400.00 for arrears up to June 19, 2019 and $190.00 for the application filing fee. In support of her application, the Landlord submitted a rent receipt dated January 15, 2018 for $4,200.00 and all of the cheques the Tenants have provided her throughout the rest of the tenancy. 13. The Tenants did not dispute that they have not paid the Landlord any money since February 20, 2019. The Tenants only took issue with their initial payment of $4,200.00 from January, 2018. The Tenants testified that they have never been clear about whether this payment was for rent. They do not dispute that they made this payment to the Landlord in January, 2018, although they claim they have never been given a receipt for this payment. 14. I find the Tenants’ position and their questions regarding the purpose of the $4,200.00 payment from January, 2018 very bizarre. The Tenants did not dispute that the tenancy started in January, 2018; that the rent has always been $2,100.00 per month; that they did not expect to live in the rental unit for free in January and February, 2018; and that any other rent payments they made were for March 20, 2018 and onwards. I accept the Landlord’s testimony that the parties agreed and always understood that this payment was in respect of the rent for January and February, 2018. The Tenants seems to question whether this payment should be applied to the arrears owing under the application (i.e. for the period beginning February 20, 2019) but I have no basis for making such a finding. 15. The Tenants did not present any concrete evidence to cast doubt on the Landlord’s claim or the substantial evidence she presented in support of that claim. Therefore, based on the evidence before me, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Tenants owe the Landlord $8,590.00 as the Landlord claims. Section 83 considerations 16. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. In arriving at this determination, I considered the following circumstances disclosed at the hearing: • The fact that the Tenants owe the Landlord significant arrears and they have not paid the Landlord any money for five months. • AS’s testimony that he cannot afford the rent. AS testified that his only current source of income is OSAP as he is in school studying to become a paralegal. AS testified that he receives $1,500.00 per month from OSAP but this is less than his monthly rent of $2,100.00. Not only are his OSAP payments insufficient to cover his rent, they also do not allow AS to make any payments toward the arrears. AS testified that his sister sometimes sends him money but he did not have anything in writing from her to confirm that she is willing and able to assist him with his rent or the arrears. • MP’s testimony that although she makes $2,500.00/month as a post-office manager, she no longer lives in the rental unit and she no longer contributes to the rent. • AS’s testimony that he wants to move out of the rental unit at the end of June, 2019 or by July 15, 2019 at the latest. • The fact that the parties signed a valid agreement to end the tenancy with a termination date of February 20, 2019. 17. I find that it would not be appropriate to either order conditional relief from eviction because AS testified that he wants to move out of the rental unit in any event. I also find that it would not be appropriate to delay eviction to June 30, 2019 or beyond because the Tenants testified that they cannot pay all of the arrears owing by June 30th.I find it unlikely that the Tenants will pay the rent that will become due on June 20th given AS’ testimony about his financial estuation and MP’s testimony that she is only prepared to contribute $400.00/month toward the arrears. In short, I find that if the tenancy is permitted to continue, event until June 30, 2019 it is more likely than not that the arrears will continue to increase',\n",

The Tenant is not entitled to withhold rent once he has filed applications at the Board. Tenant’s T2 application 13. The Tenant alleges that the landlord substantially interfered with his reasonable use and enjoyment of the rental because: 14. TB who is the Landlord’s son and also acts the property manager, attended the residential complex for unknown reasons on the following dates: April, 17, 2018, April 29, 2018, May 3, 2018, May 15, 2018, May 31, 2018, June 4, 2018, June 5, 2018, June 19, 2018, September 6, 2018; 15. TB attended on the grounds as late as 8:00 p.m. to mow the lawn; 16. TB unlawfully entered his rental unit to apply a pest control treatment; 17. TB changed the locks to residential complex without providing the Tenants with notice and in doing so failed to accommodate the Tenant’s injury as he required to under the AODA and other comparable legislation. 18. For the reasons that follow; the Tenant’s T2 application is dismissed; Unnecessary visits to the residential complex: 19. The Tenant testified that he had logged the number of times when he observed the Landlord on the premises between April 17, 2019 and September 6, 2019 The Tenant viewed the TB’s presence on the property as a form of harassment because the Tenant complained to the Electrical Safety Authority (ESA) about the rental unit. 20. TB agreed that he was at the residential complex on the dates noted. TB explained that he was at property, though not in or near the Tenant’s unit, for the following reasons: (a) To respond to maintenance requests made by another tenant in the residential complex; (b) To cut the grass and prepare the garbage bin for pick up; (c) To meet with a new tenant in the property and exchange keys; (d) To change the locking mechanism for the front door; and (e) To respond to a complaint about a possible trespass and install security cameras; 21. The rental unit is one of three in the complex. The building primarily houses students who are transitory. The Tenant admitted that he was unaware that other residents required TB to attend to their needs. 22. Based on the testimony of the parties I am not satisfied that the Tenant has established that the Landlord substantially interfered with his use and enjoyment of his rental unit by attending at the residential complex during the period April 1, 2018 and September 6, 2018. The Landlord was the residential complex for legitimate purposes including addressing the maintenance needs of the other tenants of the residential complex. Locks changed 23. Section 24 of the Act states: 24 A landlord shall not alter the locking system on a door giving entry to a rental unit or residential complex or cause the locking system to be altered during the tenant’s occupancy of the rental unit without giving the tenant replacement keys. 24. TB did not dispute the Tenant’s evidence that on or about July 18, 2018 he replaced the existing lock system that required the residents to lock the main entrance door with key when they exited with a self-locking system. 25. The parties agree that entry key remained the same only the locking system changed. 26. TB explained that he wrote the residents of the property on July 18, 2018 and explained that he switched the door knob and lock because of a safety situation brought to his attention by the parents of the two tenants who reside in the middle floor unit. he was notified that one of the female students arrived home late on night and found the main entrance door ajar and identified it as a safety concern. 27. TB testified that when he investigated the complaint, he discovered that the main door to the property was often left unlocked and he felt to an automatic locking device would be safer, especially for the units occupied by the female students. 28. TB testified that the property is near Humber College in Toronto and to make his units appealing to students and their parents he takes security seriously which includes installing security systems and making sure that the doors lock properly. 29. At no time was the Tenant unable to enter the residential complex due to the Landlord’s installation of a new locking device. TB produced a copy of his notice to the Tenants of the property letting the them that he had changed the knob and installed an auto lock system. His message also confirmed that the keys remained unchanged. The Tenant did not dispute being able o use his main entrance key to gain access after the new door knob and auto lock system were installed. 30. Based on the testimony of the parties, I am not satisfied that the Tenant has proven that Landlord changed the locks to the rental unit illegally and failed to provide the Tenant with a key. Failure to Accommodate injured wrist: 31. The Tenant alleged that Landlord breached his obligation to accommodate a disability/ injury to the Tenant’s right arm. The Tenant testified that he preferred the old door knob and locking system to the new one due to his wrist injury. 32. The Tenant asked to have the old locking system returned to the property. However, it was unclear how the new locking system and door knob would affect his injury. The Tenant provided a medical note from his specialist which explained the nature of his physical issue. The medical note suggests that the Tenant can manage his discomfort by modifying his activities. 33. The Tenant acknowledged that he had not notified either the Landlord or TB that he required accommodation prior to filing his application. 34. It is settled that law that accommodation is a collaborative process. A tenant is required to notify a landlord of any issue requiring accommodation. In this case, the Tenant did not notify the Landlord that he required accommodation. Therefore, I cannot find that the Landlord breached its obligation to accommodate the Tenant prior to hearing date. 35. Furthermore, the evidence does not establish that the Tenant continues to require the requested accommodation TB relied on video evidence which he submitted to show that the Tenant has full range of motion and use of the wrist he alleged is injured. The video shows the Tenant using a variety of tools to remove his tire, lug nuts and alternator. The images also depict the Tenant using his injured hand to open the door with the new door knob. Therefore, based on the evidence of the parties, I am unable to determine that the Tenant suffers from disability that requires the accommodation he has requested. Unauthorized entry to spray for ants: 36. The Tenant also alleged that the Landlord substantially interfered with use and enjoyment of the rental unit by entering the unit illegally on May 22, 2018 to spray it for ants. 37. TB’s submitted an invoice given by Orkin the company hired to spray for ants, which confirms that it was basement apartment that was sprayed for ants and not the Tenant’s unit. Any odours the Tenant smelt in his unit likely travelled up from the basement. 38. Therefore, the Tenant’s T2 application shall be dismissed as I am not satisfied that Landlord, TB or Orkin accessed the Tenant’s unit on May 22, 2019 to spray for ants. T6 application Tenant’s evidence: 39. The Tenant claims that the Landlord breached his maintenance and repair obligations under s. 20 of the Act because the rental unit is not air conditioned and the Tenant is unable to operate a large portable air conditioner in his bedroom. 40. The Tenant explained that when he attempted to operate the air conditioner in June 2018 his lights flickered and eventually shut off. 41. The Tenant notified TB who responded immediately advising the Tenant to operate the air conditioning unit from the larger bedroom at the back of the rental unit and open the doors allowing the cool air to circulate. 42. When the problem persisted between June 1, 2018 and August 8, 2018, the Tenant contacted the Electrical Safety Authority (ESA) and arranged to have one of its investigators look into the wiring. 43. The investigation by the ESA concluded that air conditioner was overloading the outlet the Tenant plugged it into and that unless the Landlord added a new fuse/amp to the circuit breaker or the Tenant used different plug, the problem would persist. 44. The ESA investigator did not issue a work order or provide a written report citing any ESA violations against the Landlord. Instead they explained that the solution could be a few hundred dollars and a new fuse added to fuse box. Landlord’s Response: 45. TB agreed that the electrical wiring in the residential complex could be updated if they chose but they have never been ordered to do so by the ESA. TB explained that he and his father own several small residential complexes and they allocate capital improvements/expenditures annually based on the immediate need of each property. 46. TB explained given the age of the property, they do not offer air conditioning in the property that houses the rental unit because they know that the wiring is older. They have never objected to Tenants using their own air conditioning unit provide that they did so within safe parameters. 47. TB argued that previous tenants have used portable air conditioning units in the rental unit without incident because they operated the portable units safely. 48. TB explained that he sent his own electrician out in August when the Tenant complained that the problem persisted. TB testified that his electrician inspected the electrical outlet in the rental unit and found that they were functioning appropriately. Analysis: 49. Section 20 of the Act states: 20 (1)A landlord is responsible for providing and maintaining a residential complex, including the rental units in it, in a good state of repair and fit for habitation and for complying with health, safety, housing and maintenance standards. [emphasis added] 50. There is no dispute between the parties that TB responded within hours to the first compliant regarding the power outage. There is also no dispute that he responded quickly each time the Tenant complained. 51. The key issue raised in this application is whether the Tenant is entitled to operate any appliance from anywhere within the rental unit that he choses. In other words, is it a breach of the Landlord’s obligation under section 20 to limit the Tenant operation of the air conditioning unit to the spare bedroom at the back of the rental unit. 52. The ESA investigated the rental unit and did not find that the Landlord was in breach of any standard relating to the electrical wiring. Further, it cannot be said that the Tenant’s inability to place his air conditioner in the room of his choosing makes the rental unit unfit for habitation. 53. Thus, in order for the Tenant’s claim to be successful he must establish that the fact that the existing wiring in the residential complex is insufficient for the Tenant’s air conditioner other than in one of the bedrooms means that the rental unit is not in a good state of repair 54. Under contract law a landlord is obliged to ensure that the tenant receives the entire bundle of rights he contracted for. The Tenant’s interpretation that he enjoys unfettered use and access to the rental unit is in correct, however, he should receive exactly what he contracted for. Here the lease did not include an air conditioning unit. Therefore, the Tenant does not have an automatic entitlement to be able to operate his air conditioner anywhere in the rental unit. 55. Further, the electrical wiring does operate as intended – it provides a supply of electricity so long as the circuits are overloaded. What the Tenant wants the Landlord to do is improve or upgrade the electrical system so that it is capable of running an air conditioner anywhere in the rental unit 56. Therefore, I find that the Landlord did not fail to meet the Landlord's obligations under subsection 20(1) of the Act. An important distinction must be made between a landlord’s maintenance and repair obligations under section 20(1) that would trigger an automatic inquiry into whether a tenant has been deprived of something he or she contracted for, and the situation we have here, where two separate qualified electricians investigated the Tenant’s complaint and concluded that the wiring did not need repair. The Tenant’s claim is based on his view that he is entitled to operate the air conditioning from any room in the unit so chooses\",\n",

In persistent late payment cases a tenancy can be brought into good standing where the tenant demonstrates a change in circumstances or practices that can return the tenancy to good standing. In the present case, the Tenant testified that he now has the means to pay the rent on time and understands his obligation to do so. 18. It was uncontested that there are no arrears of rent owing, only the application filing fee remains outstanding. 19. The Tenant will be ordered to pay the rent on time and in full for a 12 month period.

L2 Application – Damage 8. At the hearing the Landlord that on November 3, 2019 the Tenant called the Landlord and asked for a copy of the rental unit key. The Landlord could not give the Tenant a copy of the key because in July 2019 the Tenant lost his key and the Landlord gave the Tenant his only copy, which was not returned. 9. The Landlord testified that soon after November 3, 2019 he noticed that the lock for the rental unit had been removed. The Landlord checked the security video footage and found that on November 3, 2019, two men came up to the rental unit door and applied tools and force to the area of the door where the lock was located. The Landlord submitted still photographs of this security footage showing the two men and their activities with the door. The Landlord also submitted a photograph of the door, showing that the lock had been removed. From the photograph, it appears it was removed by force and that the door is damaged as a result. 10. The Landlord did not recognize either of the two men seen in the security camera footage. The Landlord testified that to get to the rental unit, these men would have to have been let into the building or have been given a key. 11. Based on the Landlord’s uncontested evidence, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Tenant caused the door to be damaged by directing two men to remove his lock and by providing these men access to the rental unit. The evidence here is circumstantial but a reasonable inference may be drawn that the Tenant, who had requested a key, arranged for these men to remove his lock for him. 12. The Landlord submitted an estimate for the repair of the door and the replacement of the lock in the amount of $926.60 including HST. I find this to be a reasonable cost for the repair. L2 Application – Interference with Others 13. The Landlord’s N5 notice of termination. also alleges that the Tenant substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The N5 notice alleges that the Tenant removed the lock and broke the door. The voiding period for the N5 notice is November 7, 2019 to November 13, 2019. 14. The Landlord gave no evidence that the Tenant engaged in similar conduct during the voiding period. I therefore find that the substantial interference portion of the N5 notice is void. L2 application: s.83 15. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. 16. The Tenant was not at the hearing to request relief from eviction. The Landlord seeks termination. I believe it would be unfair to deny eviction in these circumstances. When the Tenant was unable to enter the unit because he lost his unit key (for the second time) and the Landlord could not let him in, he arranged for people to remove his lock. This behaviour shows a blatant disregard for the Tenant’s obligations to keep the unit and residential complex in a good state of repair\",\n",
       " \"Pest infestation was not been adequately dealt with; and i. The heating was not turned on in accordance with the Act. 10. The Tenant also testified that on December 27, 2018 there was a radiator leak in the apartment above his, which caused water to flow into his unit and damage his sheets, books and property. 11. Based on the evidence of the Tenant, I find that the Tenant failed to provide sufficient particulars regarding the heat in the rental unit, and pests and pest control issues to meet the burden of proof to prove his claim. These portions of the claim will be dismissed. Limitation Period for Tenant’s Claims 12. Pursuant to subsection 29(2) of the Act, “no application may be made under subsection (1) more than one year after the day the alleged conduct giving rise to the application occurred”. 13. As the Tenant’s claim was initially made before the Board on March 2, 2020, on the basis of subsection 29(2) of the Act, I cannot consider maintenance and repair issues alleged to have occurred prior to March 1, 2018. 14. Additionally, on the basis of the Divisional Court’s decision in the case of Toronto Community Housing Corporation v. Vlahovich, [2010] O.J. No. 1463, I find that a tenant’s request for an abatement of rent may extend no further back than one year from the date the claims were raised before the Board. 15. As the radiator leak causing damage to the Tenant’s property fell outside of the limitation period, that portion of the claim for lost or damaged property will be dismissed. Analysis of the Maintenance and Repair Claims 16. The Tenant testified to the outstanding maintenance and repair issues as listed in paragraph 6 above and confirmed that they remained outstanding at the time of the hearing. The Tenant requested an abatement of rent in the amount of 8% to 10% of his rent. 17. The Landlord testified that the Tenant never advised him that he was refusing to pay rent due to outstanding maintenance and repair issues. The Landlord testified that the pest control treatments could not be adequately completed as the Tenant had refused access to the rental unit and had refused to allow the treatments to occur. The Landlord testified that they attempted to deal with the pest infestation and they were forced to bring an application against the Tenant in the past year because of hoarding and the infestation in the rental unit. 18. On the basis of the evidence before the Board, I find that the Tenant did not meet the burden of proof to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that the Landlord failed to address the pest infestation issue as there was evidence to the contrary. 19. The testimony of the Tenant regarding the balance of the maintenance and repair issues listed in paragraph 6 (a) to (g) were largely uncontested by the Landlord. On the basis of the evidence before the Board, I find on the balance of probabilities that Landlord failed to meet the Landlord’s obligations under subsection 20(1) of the Act to maintain the residential complex and failed to comply with maintenance standards in regard to the items in paragraph 6(a) to (g). 20. Due to the Landlords’ failure to comply with subsection 20(1) of the Act, the Tenant is entitled to an abatement of rent. 21. An abatement of rent is a contractual remedy on the principle that if you are paying 100% of the rent then you should receive 100% of what you are paying for and if you do not receive that, then a tenant should be entitled to an abatement for the difference in value. 22. In determining the amount of entitlement for an abatement of rent, I am required to consider the impact of disrepair on the Tenant, from March 1, 2018 onwards. Based on the evidence of the Tenant I find that the Tenant was impacted by the numerous outstanding maintenance issues in the rental unit and is entitled to 8% abatement of rent in the amount of $584.40. Set-Off of amounts owing between the parties 23. The Divisional Court in Marineland of Canada Inc. v. Olsen, 2011 ONSC 6522, has indicated that when the Board is aware of situations where there are two applications involving the same parties, it should be made clear to the parties that any amount owed to one party under a Board order is to be set off against monies awarded to the opposing party. As the Tenant has been awarded monies with respect to their section 82 claim, that amount shall be set off against the arrears of rent the Tenant owes the Landlord in the application. 24. The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $608.73 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord. 25. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2019 to December 10, 2019. 26. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until March 31, 2020 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act as the Tenant has a last month’s rent on deposit and testified that he would require time to find alternative housing\",\n",

Nevertheless, the Tenant’s position appeared to be that no rent was owing or payable, and that she would pay nothing. However, without any section 82 issues to reduce the arrears, without any authority to deal with RGI issues and without any evidence of errors in the Landlord’s calculations, the Tenant’s position was untenable. Moreover, the Tenant may want to reconsider her position if she wants to preserve this tenancy where it is unlikely such liberal relief would be proposed or granted in the event of any subsequent motion to set aside an order. 8. The total amount owing is $9,366.00, which includes $9,176.00 for arrears of rent and $190.00 for the filing fee',\n",

       " \"When he was asked how the submission of these documents would prejudice the Landlord in his ability to advance his case at the hearing, the Landlord’s legal representative could not say how or even that the Landlord would be prejudiced. For this reason, I accepted the disputed evidence at the hearing. 4. Also at the outset of the hearing, the Tenants’ representative sought to admit evidence and make submissions regarding an allegation that the Landlord’s actions constitute an abuse of the Board’s process. The Tenants’ representative had not disclosed this as an issue to the Landlord in advance nor had he disclosed the proposed evidence to the Landlord as was ordered by the interim order issued on September 5, 2017. As the Landlord would be prejudiced by the admission of evidence and submissions on this issue with no notice, I refused to accept the Tenant’s representative’s evidence and submissions on this issue. 5. At the hearing the Tenants raised the following issues under s.82 of the Act (pursuant to the list of issues that they disclosed to the Landlord prior to the hearing): a) The Landlord disposed of the August payment of rent and then engaged in eviction proceedings for non-payment; b) The Landlord failed to satisfy an order made by the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario (HRTO) with respect to the tenancy; c) The Landlord made derogatory comments about the Tenant to the press; d) The Landlord damaged the Tenant’s bicycle; and e) The Landlord breached his maintenance obligations under s.20 of the Act. 6. Although the Landlord was present at the hearing, he did not give any evidence at the hearing. The Landlord disposed of the August 2017 payment of rent 7. At the hearing JG testified that the Tenants have lived in the unit for five years and that for their entire tenancy they have been paying their rent to the Landlord by leaving a cheque in their mailbox on the first of the month. JG testified that on August 1, 2017 she placed an envelope containing the Tenants’ cheque for August 2017 in the mailbox as usual. JG testified that shortly after she had put the envelope in the mailbox, she saw the envelope crumpled up and in the garbage. At the hearing JG submitted a photograph showing an unwrinkled envelope with the Landlord’s name on it being placed in a mailbox and a photograph of the same enveloped crumpled in a garbage bin. 8. On August 2, 2017, the Landlord served the Tenants with an N4 Notice to End your Tenancy For Non-Payment of Rent (‘N4 notice’). The N4 notice states that the Tenants owe $1,198.76 in arrears of rent for August 2017. 9. At the hearing JG submitted a copy of an exchange of text messages between JG and the Landlord on August 4, 2017. The text from JG states that she received the N4 notice and also retrieved her rent cheque from the garbage after the Landlord threw it out. The Landlord’s text message reads as follows: “Is. Not bogus. Body. There. Is no. Rent chek. This. Time. Will cost. 190 dollar. Application fee. If rent. Is not paid. On. 1” I interpret this message to mean that the Landlord denies putting the cheque in the garbage and stating that he intends to file an application to the Board if the rent is not paid. 10. JG testified that she was concerned about this situation because the Landlord has done this kind of thing in the past. JG testified that a year ago the Tenant RR saw the Landlord throwing one of their rent payments in the garbage and that the Landlord served an N4 notice shortly afterward. JG testified that she spoke to the Landlord as he was serving the N4 notice and mentioned that RR saw him throwing the cheque in the trash. The Landlord cashed the cheque (presumably he retrieved it from the trash) and no application was filed. 11. JG testified that the Landlord also threw out her cheque for January 2017 and then served an N4 notice and filed an application. JG testified that she attended the hearing of that application prepared to defend herself based on the Landlord’s actions but that she decided to deal with this issue in her application to the HRTO. JG consented to an order that resolved that application. 12. Based on JG’s uncontested evidence, I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the Landlord threw the Tenants’ rent cheque for August 2017 in the garbage and then served the Tenants with an N4 notice. JG testified that she saw the cheque in the garbage and that a year previously RR saw the Landlord dispose of their rent cheque. The Landlord was present at the hearing and could have testified that he did not dispose of the August 2017 rent cheque but he did not. It is reasonable to assume that if he had not engaged in this conduct, he would testify that he had not engaged in this conduct. 13. In terms of a remedy for this conduct, the Tenants’ representative submitted that JG should be entitled to compensation for lost income due to her attendance at the hearing of this application, her attendance at the previous hearing date for this application, and her trips to the bank to pay her rent into the Board. JG could have made her August 2017 payment after the Landlord served the N4 notice. She chose not to do so and instead to deal with this issue through the Board. The consequence of that decision is that there were appearances at the Board. For this reason, it would not be appropriate to order that the Landlord compensate JG for her appearances at the Board on this matter. Similarly, JG chose to raise s.82 issues at the hearing, which resulted in her paying her rent into the Board pending the resolution of this matter. For this reason, it would not be appropriate to order that the Landlord compensate JG for her time to take trips to the bank to pay her rent into the Board. 14. The Tenants did not request any other remedy for this conduct, other than to request that the Board not order the Tenants to pay the filing fee. The filing of this application would not have been necessary if the Landlord had not thrown out the August 2017 cheque. The Landlord decided to file this application under these circumstances and so it would not be fair to order the Tenants to compensate him for it. 15. The parties did not make submissions as to whether the Landlord, by his conduct, waived his right to rent for August 2017. I would have considered this submission very seriously, but since the issue was not raised, I cannot make determinations on it. The Landlord failed to satisfy an order made by the HRTO 16. Although the Board and the HRTO are part of the same cluster of tribunals, they are separate entities. To illustrate this: Members of the Board cannot conduct hearings at the HRTO unless they are also appointed to the HRTO. 17. Because the HRTO is a separate entity, the Board has no role in enforcing the HRTO’s decisions. 18. The Tenants’ representative submitted that there should be an order allowing the Tenants to set off their arrears against the Landlord’s obligation to pay the Tenants pursuant to the HRTO order. The Tenants’ representative submitted that Marineland of Canada Inc. v. Olsen, 2011 ONSC 6522 (‘Marineland’) gives me authority to do this. I do not interpret Marineland in this way. The facts in Marineland were that the tenants were in arrears of rent and the Board made an order requiring the landlord to pay an amount to the tenants as compensation related to a notice of termination. In Marineland there was no order issued by a separate court, tribunal or other decision making authority against which arrears were sought to be set off. In this case, the Tenant’s representative essentially requests that the Board partially enforce the HRTO order. The Board does not have the jurisdiction to do this. Accordingly, there will be no order setting off the Tenants’ arrears against the amount owed to the Tenants by the Landlord. The Landlord made derogatory comments about the Tenant to the press 19. At the hearing JG submitted a copy of an article published by a major news outlet online on July 5, 2017 which reports on the HRTO decision. In the article the Landlord is quoted as saying “she can go screw herself… She provokes me and I call her a hooker…, what’s the big f------ deal?” The article also quotes the Landlord asserting that his statements were in accordance with his freedom of speech and saying that JG is a liar. The article quotes the Landlord asserting that he intends to fight the decision and he does not intend to satisfy the order. 20. The Tenants did not request any monetary remedy for the statements made in this article, so none will be ordered. The Landlord damaged JG’s bicycle 21. The HRTO order makes explicit findings about this issue and part of the remedy awarded is in relation to this issue. This issue is therefore barred by issue estoppel, which is a branch of the doctrine of res judicata. 22. Issue estoppel precludes a litigant from raising issues in a proceeding that were already adjudicated in a previous proceeding. The principles behind the doctrine of issue estoppel are that litigation should have finality (it should not be allowed to continue indefinitely), inconsistent results should be avoided, judicial resources should not be wasted on duplicative claims, and parties should not be permitted to harass one another with duplicative claims. 23. The criteria for issue estoppel, as per Richard A. Feldman in his Residential Tenancies, 9th ed. (Toronto: Carswell, 2009) at p.90, are: i) the same question (issue) currently being advanced has already been decided in an earlier proceeding; ii) that earlier decision was final; and iii) the parties (or their privies) are the same now as in that earlier proceeding. 22. The criteria for issue estoppel are met here. The Landlord breached his maintenance obligations under s.20 of the Act 23. At the hearing the Tenants’ representative sought to raise a large number of maintenance issues. However, several of these were addressed by the HRTO order and so these are also barred by issue estoppel. However, the Tenants’ representative also sought to raise a number of maintenance issues that arose after the hearing that gave rise to the HRTO order. The date of that hearing was May 8, 2017. Maintenance issues that arose or were still in existence after May 8, 2017 are not barred by issue estoppel. 24. The Tenants raised the following maintenance issues that are not barred by issue estoppel: • Weeds in the backyard; • Stairwell was dirty and was soiled with cat urine; • Ceiling light did not work; • Railing on the stairwell was loose; • Snow and ice were not removed from entryway; and • Fire alarm malfunctioned. Weeds 25. At the hearing JG submitted photographs that she took in the summer of 2017 showing the backyard of the residential complex. These photographs show that the backyard was overgrown with so many weeds that the yard appears unusable for any purpose. JG testified that the Tenants complained about the weeds and the Landlord did nothing to address them. 26. The Landlord did not give any evidence to contest the Tenants’ evidence respecting the weeds. 27. Based on the Tenants’ uncontested evidence, I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the Landlord failed to maintain the backyard in a good state of repair with respect to the excessive weeds. I therefore find that the Landlord breached s.20 of the Act with respect to this issue. Stairwell not clean 28. JG testified that the Landlord does not keep the stairwells in the residential complex clean and that they often smell of cat urine. 29. At the hearing JG submitted a copy of a City of Toronto order dated December 8, 2017 indicating that “the property is not maintained and/or kept clean in accordance with the standards” (‘first City order’). The first City order does not say anything about stairwells. JG also submitted a copy of a document entitled “Investigation Detail,” which repeats the same statement as the first City order and indicates that this issue is closed. 30. The Landlord did not give any evidence to contest the Tenants’ evidence respecting the cleanliness of the stairwell. 31. Based on the Tenants’ uncontested evidence, I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the Landlord failed to maintain the stairwell a reasonably clean condition. Although the City order does not specifically mention the stairwell, JG testified that the stairwell was dirty and smelled like urine. I therefore find that the Landlord breached s.20 of the Act with respect to this issue. Ceiling light 32. JG testified that in September 2017 the light in the ceiling above the stairwell leading to the rental unit stopped working. JG testified that she notified the Landlord about this problem in early October 2017. JG testified that a new bulb was put in the light in January 2018 and that the light then worked for three days but then it stopped working again. 33. The first City order notes that the ceiling light does not work. At the hearing JG submitted a copy of a City of Toronto order dated March 27, 2018 (‘second City order’). The second City order also notes that the ceiling light does not work. 34. JG testified that the ceiling light started working again three days before the hearing date. 35. The Landlord did not give any evidence to contest the Tenants’ evidence respecting the ceiling light. 36. Based on the Tenants’ uncontested evidence, I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the Landlord failed to maintain the ceiling light in a good state of repair. I therefore find that the Landlord breached s.20 of the Act with respect to this issue. Stairwell railing 37. JG testified that on March 25, 2018, she heard a loud noise in the hallway and went out to investigate. JG testified that she saw the other Tenant RR in the stairwell and he said that he had missed a step on the way up the stairs and grabbed the handrail, the handrail came out of the wall and he tumbled down the stairs. JG testified that RR received medical attention after his fall but JG did not submit any medical documentation to support this testimony. 38. JG testified that RR reported the incident to the Landlord by text message. At the hearing JG submitted a copy of the message to the Landlord. The message is from RR and says he fell down the stairs the previous night and the railing fell off. The message recommends that the Landlord put a light bulb in the ceiling light and fix the railing. JG testified that RR did not receive a response to this message from the Landlord. 39. The second City order states that the handrails on the stairwell are not maintained in good repair and that there are holes in the walls of the stairwell. 40. JG testified that the stairwell railing was repaired on April 3, 2018. 41. The Landlord did not give any evidence to contest the Tenants’ evidence respecting the stairwell railing. 42. Based on the Tenants’ uncontested evidence, I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the Landlord failed to maintain the stairwell railing in a good state of repair. I therefore find that the Landlord breached s.20 of the Act with respect to this issue. Snow and ice not removed 43. JG testified that the Landlord does not have snow or ice removed from the walkways leading to the residential complex at all during the winter and he does not apply salt to these walkways. JG testified that as a result of the ice and snow on the walkways, two of her guests had slipped and fell on the walkways this winter. 44. At the hearing JG submitted photographs that she took of the walkways in January 2018. The photographs show a significant accumulation of snow and ice on the walkway leading to the residential complex. JG testified that this is what the walkway looked like all winter, except when the City of Toronto ordered the Landlord to clear the walkway. 45. At the hearing JG submitted a copy of an “Investigation Detail” indicating that the Landlord had been ordered to clear the exterior steps, landings, walks, driveways, parking spaces, and ramps of snow and ice on February 6, 2018. 46. WCT is a friend of JG. At the hearing WCT testified that she often visits JG at the rental unit. WCT testified that throughout the past winter the walkway to the residential complex was covered in a sheet of ice. WCT testified that she fell twice in December 2017 while walking on the icy walkway. WCT testified that she was not injured. 47. The Landlord did not give any evidence to contest the Tenants’ evidence respecting the icy walkway. 48. Based on the Tenants’ uncontested evidence, I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the Landlord failed to remove ice and snow from walkway in the winter months. I therefore find that the Landlord breached s.20 of the Act with respect to this issue. Fire alarm 49. JG testified that at 2:30am on February 5, 2018 the carbon monoxide/smoke detector (‘detector’) in her unit started making a loud noise and woke her up. JG testified that she notified the Landlord immediately and that he did not reply to her. The detector is hardwired into the ceiling of the unit. 50. JG testified that she contacted the fire department and asked if she should be concerned. They sent some firefighters who inspected for a carbon monoxide leak while the Tenant waited outside. The firefighters told JG that they could not make the detector stop and they could not dismantle the detector, as only the Landlord is allowed to dismantle it. 51. JG testified that the noise from the detector, which she described as a loud chirping, continued through the following night. JG testified that on February 6, 2018, a fire inspector attended, dismantled the detector, and gave the Tenant two replacement battery powered detectors. JG testified that a man who said he was acting for the Landlord attended at the unit on February 10, 2018 and installed a new hardwired detector. 52. At the hearing JG submitted photographs of the malfunctioning detector showing that it has a sticker on it indicating that it should be replaced in 2017. JG also submitted a copy of notes that she took outlining the chronology of the detector malfunction, including all visits and inspections to address the issue. 53. The Landlord did not give any evidence to contest the Tenants’ evidence respecting the malfunctioning detector. 54. Based on the Tenants’ uncontested evidence, I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the detector malfunctioned on February 5, 2018, that while it was malfunctioning it made a loud irritating noise and that the Landlord was notified of this around 2:00am that morning. It was reasonable for the Landlord not to respond that morning as he was very likely asleep when JG sent her text message. However, it was not reasonable to ignore JG’s message and then send someone five days later, as the Landlord had been put on notice in the message that the detector was making a loud irritating noise. I therefore find that the Landlord breached s.20 of the Act with respect to this issue. Remedies for maintenance issues 55. The Tenants’ representative submitted that the Tenants are entitled to a rent abatement of 10% per month for the period of June 2017 to April 2018 for the issues regarding the stairwell (dirt/urine smell, broken light and railing). JG testified that the light stopped working in September 2017 and that she notified the Landlord in early October 2017 and it was fixed in early April 2018, so this is the relevant time period for the light issue. JG gave no evidence about the condition of the railing prior to RR’s fall on the stairs in March 2018. JG testified that the issue of dirt and urine smell started some time around or before 2016 and was ongoing to the date of the hearing. 56. After considering the duration of this problem and the impact on the Tenants’ enjoyment and use of the rental unit, I find that for all of these issues the Tenants are entitled to a rent abatement of 5% per month for the period of early October 2017 through to and including early April 2018 (calculated as $362.87, based on rent of $1,209.57) and for the dirt/urine smell issue they are entitled to an additional 2% per month for the period of June 2017 through to and including September 2017 (calculated as $95.90, based on rent of $1,198.76). The total rent abatement for stairwell issues is $458.77. 57. The Tenants’ representative submitted that the Tenants are entitled to a rent abatement of 5% per month for the period of June 2017 to August 2017 for the Landlord’s failure to maintain the backyard. This is reasonable, as the Tenants’ evidence demonstrated that the backyard was unusable during this time. The total abatement awarded for this issue is $179.81, based on rent of $1,198.76. 58. The Tenants’ representative submitted that the Tenants are entitled to a rent abatement of 5% per month for the period of November 2017 to February 2018 for the Landlord’s failure to maintain the walkway free of ice and snow. This is reasonable, as the Tenants’ evidence demonstrated that the walkway was covered in ice during this time and that this posed a danger to themselves and their guests (as manifested when WCT fell twice). The total abatement awarded for this issue is $241.91, based on rent of $1,209.57. 59. The Tenants’ representative made no submissions about a remedy for the detector issue. However, JG’s notes outlining the chronology of the issue includes claims for time spent cleaning up after visitors who were at the unit inspecting or addressing the issue. I have interpreted this as a claim for a rent abatement. I have found that it was not reasonable for the Landlord to ignore the issue after the early morning of February 5, 2018; he ought to have at least been in contact with the Tenant on the day of February 5, 2018 and stopped the annoying noise by that night. It was fixed the following day. After considering the duration of this problem (one day) and the impact on the Tenants’ enjoyment and use of the rental unit (lost sleep and JG’s narrative states that it was very inconvenient for her to have to stay home to meet the inspector who resolved the issue), I find that the Tenants are entitled to a lump sum rent abatement of $100.00. 60. JG’s narrative notes also claim compensation for lost income related to staying home for follow-up inspections by Toronto Fire Services on February 9 and 23, 2018. From JG’s notes it is apparent that these claims are based on the inspector’s conduct, over which the Landlord has no control. There will therefore be no order that this compensation be paid by the Landlord. 61. The total abatement awarded due to the Landlord’s breaches of s.20 of the Act is $980.49. This reduces the Tenants’ arrears to $218.27. 62. The Tenants’ representative submitted that the Board should make an order prohibiting the Landlord from harassing JG. The only evidence I heard that the Landlord has ever harassed JG is the media article published after the release of the HRTO decision. This does not establish habitual harassment and so there will be no order prohibiting the Landlord from harassing JG. This is not to say that the Landlord is permitted to engage in this kind of conduct, which constitutes a breach of the Act and could result in further remedies awarded against the Landlord in subsequent proceedings. 63. The Tenants’ representative submitted that the Board should also make an order requiring the Landlord to provide contact information for a person who could respond more promptly to maintenance issues. Although this would be prudent for the Landlord to do, the facts in this case do not establish such an egregious neglect of maintenance obligations that such an order should be made. 64. At the hearing the parties consented to an order that the Tenant may make her rent payments to the Landlord’s legal representative electronically in trust for the Landlord and that this arrangement will continue until the Tenant is informed otherwise in writing. Section 83 65. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. 66. The Landlord’s behaviour in disposing of the Tenants’ August 2017 rent cheque then serving an N4 notice could only have been intended to start the eviction process without merit. Under these circumstances it would not be fair to order eviction\",\n",
       " \"Having considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), I find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until April 21, 2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. The extension of the termination date, and the usual delay in enforcement, will allow the Tenant an ample opportunity to find new accommodation. This is especially so as, since at least late September, 2017, the Tenant ought to have been aware there was a chance his tenancy would come to an end and, accordingly, he should have been taking steps to find alternate accommodation in the event he is unable to void my order, below\",\n",

       " \"I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). 10. In particular, I have considered that, based on their monthly income and expenses, the Tenants cannot afford the monthly rent as well as their monthly bills. In fact, it appears that the Tenants have not been able to afford the rental unit for quite some time and have not made any payments towards the rent since August 2017. 11. The arrears are now quite substantial and have put the Landlords in a precarious financial position. The Landlords are living in a 2 bedroom apartment along with their two children, ages 4 and 1 ½ years old, and 4 other relatives. The Landlords’ children are sleeping on the floor and the youngest child has a congenital heart problem that requires constant care and medical attention. The child is not able to properly recover due to their cramped living conditions. 12. The Tenants are living with their 10 year old son and their 25 year old son in the rental unit which is a 4 bedroom house. The Tenants are seeking relief from eviction in the form of delay until February 28, 2018. However, the Tenants’ financial situation is bleak and is not set to improve in the foreseeable future. The Tenants have been aware of this impending eviction since they were served with the notice of termination in October 2017. Due to the extensive amount of time that has passed and the substantial arrears, and the circumstances of both the parties, I find that it would be unfair to grant the Tenants any kind of relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act\",\n",
       " \"Having considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and based on fairness to the parties, we find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 28, 2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. While this is not a long-term tenancy, as the Tenants moved into the unit in late 2016, the first-named Tenant does, in all likelihood, live with some physical health issues and both Tenants should have a reasonable amount of time to find new accommodation if it comes to that. 21. In this way, given the one-week delay in issuing this order, the relief afforded the Tenants in the preceding paragraph and the inevitable delay in enforcement by the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff), the Tenants will have some time to find new accommodation in the event they are unable to void the order by paying the required amount, as outlined below\",\n",

Based upon the uncontested evidence provided at the hearing, I see no reason to delay or deny the Landlord’s request for eviction. L2 application 7. The Landlord testified that the Tenant – or someone permitted by the Tenant in the residential complex, had wilfully or negligently damaged the doorbell to the unit. She outlined that when she confronted the Tenant about the damaged doorbell, the Tenant did not admit that he or his guests had done the damage, but the Tenant undertook to fix the doorbell himself. The Landlord testified that this led her to conclude that the Tenant or his guests had caused this problem. However, the Landlord added, the Tenant has not attended to the doorbell repair/replacement to date (despite his promise to do so). 8. PL testified that he had received two estimates to replace the damaged doorbell: one from Rona in the amount of $99.43 and a second from an electrician in the amount of $82.48. 9. Based upon the uncontested evidence provided by the Landlord and PL, I find that the Tenant and/or someone permitted by the Tenant in the residential complex damaged the doorbell for the unit. Under the circumstances, it seems reasonable to me to require the Tenant to pay an amount to replace and/or repair the doorbell. Under the circumstances, I find the lesser of the two estimates put forward by the Landlord to be more reasonable - $82.48. As such, an order will be made requiring the Tenant to pay to the Landlord this amount\",\n",

At the hearing the Tenant proposed a payment plan whereby the amount owed would be paid off in approximately two years. This plan would prejudice the Landlord. The Tenant cannot afford any more accelerated payment plan and so a payment plan is not feasible in this case. 19. The Tenant has a 9 year old child who lives with her in the rental unit.

Here, the Landlord’s evidence is that the NORIs were served to the Tenant, on April 20, 2016 and on April 30, 2017, in accordance with one of the permissible methods set out in subsection 191(1) of the Act and, in the absence of credible and reliable evidence to the contrary, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the NORIs were served to the Tenant as JH testified.

The Tenant has not paid the total rent he was required to pay for the period from February 1, 2016 to February 28, 2018. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective November 15, 2017. 13. The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,275.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord. 14. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from August 1, 2010 to November 15, 2017. 15. The Tenant paid $4,202.58 after the application was filed. 16.

This delay will provide the Tenant with some additional time to either obtain the necessary funds or fine a new place to live\",\n",
       " \"It is only when documents are not served in accordance with one of the permissible methods set out in subsection 191(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') or Rule 5 that a landlord must prove the tenant actually received them (pursuant to subsection 191(2) of the Act). Here, the Landlord’s evidence is that the NORI was served to the Tenant by JH, on May 28, 2016, in accordance with one of the permissible methods set out in subsection 191(1) of the Act. For the reasons that follow, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the NORI was served to the Tenant on May 28, 2016 and, therefore, the N4 notice of termination served to the Tenant on October 31, 2017, is valid. 5. On any application before the Board the party making an allegation has the onus of proving that allegation on a balance of probabilities. That means the Landlord here must lead sufficient evidence to establish it is more likely than not the NORI was served to the Tenant on May 28, 2016. 6. On a balance of probabilities means that the Landlord must show that its version of events is the more probable and should succeed. Saying something is proven on a balance of probabilities simply means that it is more likely than not to have occurred. It means that it is probable, i.e., the probability that some event happened is more than 50%--indeed, 50.1% is sufficient. In all cases, the decision maker must weigh up the evidence and decide which version is most probably true. Consequently, the real truth may never be known. All that can be done is to decide which of the parties has presented the most probable version. 7. Further, as the Supreme Court of Canada stated in F. H. v. McDougall, 2008 SCC 53 (“F. H. v. McDougall”), at paragraph 46, the civil standard of proof requires that evidence “must always be sufficiently clear, convincing and cogent to satisfy the balance of probabilities test.” Here, in my view, the Landlord’s evidence has met the required standard. 8. JH, the superintendent of the complex for the past four years, testified she served the NORI to the Tenant on or about 12 p.m. on May 28, 2016, by placing the document under the door to the unit. The Landlord provided a Notice of Rent Increase (Serving List) (the “Serving List”), completed by JH for May 28, 2016, which JH testified she completed upon serving the NORI to the Tenant. The said Serving List bears JH’s signature and indicates JH only served one NORI on May 28th—that served to the Tenant. 9. The Tenant testified she was home all day on May 28, 2016 and was able to so recall because she was sick and unable to go outdoors. Further, the Tenant recalls she was working on a university research paper at home as she was too ill to go to the library. 10. On cross-examination the Tenant acknowledged she was served with a NORI by the Landlord for a rent increase in 2017 and signed the Landlord’s Serving List in this connection. The Tenant further acknowledged she was served with a NORI for a rent increase in 2015. The Tenant was asked if there would be any benefit to the Landlord in failing to serve her with a NORI for 2016, and the Tenant stated there would be no benefit. 11. As stated above, when a landlord serves a document to a tenant in accordance with one of the permitted methods set out in subsection 191(1) of the Act or Rule 5 of the Board’s Rules, there is no concomitant obligation on the Landlord to prove the tenant actually received the document. Rule 5.1 d. lists one of the permissible methods of service of a document as follows: “for service on a person who occupies the rental unit, by placing it under the door of the unit or through a mail slot in the door.” If a Landlord opts for this method of service there is no requirement the landlord knock on the door of the unit to ascertain if the tenant is home and/or received the document being served. Indeed, if such was required, then the landlord would, in essence, be effecting personal service upon the tenant, which is another and different permissible method of service, as the landlord might as well simply hand the document to the tenant. By allowing a landlord to place the document under the door of the unit or through a mail slot in the door, Rule 5.1 d. allows the landlord to discharge her/his obligation in that fashion with no other conditions attached. 12. With respect to what transpired on May 28, 2016, I have no reason to prefer JH’s version of facts over AS’s version. However, JH’s testimony, which testimony was corroborated by the Serving List and copy of the NORI at issue, was certainly superior to that of the Tenant, who, as stated, testified she was home all day on May 28th. So, while I believe the Tenant was home on May 28th, I also believe JH placed the NORI under the door to the unit on that date. This is especially so as, while the Tenant was given an clear opportunity to cross-examine JH, the witness’s testimony remained unshaken and uncontradicted, both internally and vis-à-vis the documentary evidence provided—that is the Serving List and the copy of the NORI served to the Tenant on May 28th. 13. For the above reasons, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the NORI was served to the Tenant as JH testified on May 28th and, therefore, the N4 notice of termination served to the Tenant on October 31, 2017, is valid and the current lawful monthly rent is $1,243.58. The Landlord’s Application 1. The Tenant has not paid $329.16 of the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from September 1, 2016 to February 28, 2018. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination. 2. The Tenant also owes the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application. 3. The total amount owing to February 28, 2018 is $519.16 ($329.16 + $190.00). 4. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.

The L2 Application Persistent Late Payment of Rent 9. The Landlords’ uncontradicted evidence is the Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due. In particular, the Tenant has failed to pay the monthly rent on time each and every month from August, 2017 to February, 2018. 10. Based on the evidence presented I find, on a balance of probabilities, the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent. Substantial Interference 11. The Landlord’s application was preceded by a first N5 notice of termination (the “N5 notice”) deemed served on October 31, 2017.The first N5 notice was void because the Tenant corrected the problem within the time period set out in the notice and as permitted by subsection 64(3) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). The Landlord served a second N5 notice pursuant to Section 67 of the Act on December 8, 2016 bearing a termination date of December 31, 2017. 12. The Landlord’s allegations are that, on four occasions from September 13, 2017 to September 20, 2017, the Tenant allowed her dog to urinate and deposit feces on the balcony of the unit, which is a common element of the residential complex, and then proceeded to wash the debris off the balcony causing same to fall on the balconies below. 13. As stated, the Tenant voided the first N5 notice by ceasing the impugned conduct. The Landlord served the Tenant with a second N5 notice based on complaints received from another tenant of the complex alleging similar conduct. In particular on or about December 3, 2017 the Landlord received an incident report where the tenant below the Tenant’s unit noticed urine on her balcony, which emanated from the Tenant’s unit. 14. Based on the Landlord’s uncontradicted evidence, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the conduct of the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex, in allowing the Tenant’s dog to urinate and deposit feces in the balcony of the unit, which debris then fell on the balconies of other tenants of the complex, as described in the N5 notices and corroborated by the Landlord’s documentary evidence, has substantially interfered with other tenants' reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex and, further, that this conduct substantially interferes with a lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord and other tenants. 15. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Damages Claim 16. The Landlord provided four invoices, in the sum of $400.00, issued by the complex’s management office for the cost of cleaning dog urine in the complex. The Landlord further provided a letter from the complex’s management company requesting an additional payment of $200.00 for the same service on other occasions and stating the Tenant’s cheque for payment in this regard was returned NSF. As the said charges were charged to the unit,an order will issue requiring the Tenant to pay the Landlord $600.00\",\n",

The Tenant did not attend the hearing; making a choice not to cancel a client meeting and to submit the client letter. I have carefully considered the Tenant’s letter and its contents; as well as the longstanding duration of this tenancy. While the Tenant’s letter raises many ostensibly compelling circumstances, it is apparent from the previous decisions filed with me that many of these issues have been raised by the Tenant and considered by the Board before. While the issue of the Tenant’s own health appears to be raised here for the first time, the particulars given in the Tenant’s letter are scarce and I did not have the benefit of the Tenant’s oral evidence to highlight its nature, extent and impact. 11. In their totality, the facts before me persuade me that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction, including the information contained in the Tenant’s letter. It is plain that this is a longstanding tenancy which the Tenant remains hopeful that she can preserve. However, at the hearing of these applications, the Tenant deliberately did not attend and therefore, I was not provided the benefit of her in-person position on the issues in these applications or the impact on her of the termination of the tenancy\",\n",

The Tenant provided no other information concerning her ability to pay her monthly rent and address the significant arrears.

       " \"The Landlord’s Application 8. The Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period from December 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective February 15, 2018. 9. The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $2,300.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord. 10. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2017 to February 15, 2018. 11. The Tenant submitted, on more than one occasion, she should not be responsible for the entirety of the monthly rent, and current arrears, as the first-named Tenant vacated the unit on November 30, 2017. The Tenant also submitted, rather vehemently, she and the first-named tenancy entered into a joint tenancy with the Landlord and she and the first-named Tenant are the sole named Tenants on the lease. 12. In a joint tenancy, there is a single tenancy agreement and the tenants are jointly and severally (i.e., together and individually) liable for the payment of the entire rent for the rental unit. Effectively, this means that where there is a joint tenancy between two or more tenants and arrears are owing to the landlord, each tenant can be held liable for the entire arrears amount. Section 83 Relief 13. Having considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), I find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. 14. I say this because, while the Landlord’s legal representative requested a standard order, I asked the Tenant if she required more time to void my order, below, or to find new accommodation, and the Tenant testified, on several occasions, she has found a new place to live, effective April 1, 2018 and wishes to vacate the unit on March 31, 2018.\",\n",

The Tenant requested a payment plan but it is uncontested that the Tenant made no payments towards arrears as required in the previous payment plan (although a third party paid some of what was owed) and the Tenant did not pay her full rent during the course of the previous payment plan. The Tenant testified that she withheld her full rent and the arrears payments because of problems she was having in the unit. This is not a good reason to fail to comply with an order. Given the Tenant’s breaches of the previous order and a lack of any good reason for those breaches, it is more likely than not that the Tenant will breach any new payment plan order.

The N5 notice alleges that the Tenant has failed to maintain the unit in a state of ordinary cleanliness and that the Tenant has been using the balcony for storage. The N5 notice gives the Tenant seven days to correct the problems. The voiding period for the N5 notice is from January 23 to January 29, 2018. 9. SK is an employee of the Landlord. At the hearing SK testified that the facts set out in the N5 notice and the Landlord’s application are true. At the hearing SK submitted photographs of the unit taken by the superintendent on December 18, 2017. These photographs show the unit to be in a very cluttered condition. 10. SK testified that the Landlord’s superintendent attended at the unit on January 30, 2018 and found the unit to be in a very cluttered condition, including the balcony. At the hearing SK submitted photographs taken on January 30, 2018 showing the unit, including the balcony, to be in a very cluttered condition. 11. SK testified that the Landlord’s superintendent attended at the unit on April 19, 2018 and found the unit to be in a very cluttered condition, including the balcony. At the hearing SK submitted photographs taken on April 19, 2018 showing the unit, including the balcony, to be in a very cluttered condition. 12. Based on the Landlord’s uncontested evidence, I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the unit was in a very cluttered condition just after the voiding period. I therefore find that the Tenant did not void the N5 notice. 13.

Service was effective five days later, on March 8, 2018. The N5 notice states that the reasons for the notice are that the Tenant or the Tenant’s guests have substantially interfered with the Landlord’s or other tenants’ reasonable enjoyment of the premises and there are more people living in the rental unit than is allowed by health, safety, or housing standards. The portion of the N5 notice relating to substantial interference gives the Tenant an opportunity to void the notice by correcting the conduct within seven days of receiving the N5 notice. The portion of the N5 notice relating to overcrowding does not give the Tenant an opportunity to void the notice. 9. The N5 notice sets out allegations that the neighbours have complained about noise from the rental unit and a neighbour has complained about a sliding door. The dates in the N5 notice are the dates the Landlord received the complaints. There is no indication in the N5 notice as to what dates the noise occurred or when the sliding door issue occurred. The N5 notice does not state what the sliding door issue is. 10. In Ball v. Metro Capital Property, [2002] O.J. No. 5931 (‘Ball’), the Divisional Court stated that in order to determine the sufficiency of an N5 notice, it is necessary to consider the context of the notice. The Court held that the tenant needs to know the specific allegations against him/her for three purposes: a. to know the case that must be met; b. to decide whether to dispute the allegations; or c. to consider whether to void the notice. 10. Applying Ball to this case, I find that the N5 contains insufficient details, as it does not contain a precise enough allegation about the sliding door and it contains no dates upon which the noise is alleged to have occurred. 11. Further, the N5 notice does not include any details about the overcrowding allegation, nor does it give the Tenant an opportunity to void the overcrowding portion of the notice. 12. For the reasons above, at the hearing I found the N5 notice to be invalid. 13. In the L2 application, the Landlord claims compensation for damage done to the rental unit. The “damage” alleged to have occurred is the Landlord has incurred legal fees and had to pay the fee for this application. These things are not damage. In any event, the Landlord will recover the application fee through the L1 application. No order will be made with respect to the damage claim. 14.

If the Tenant does not make the payments required the Landlord can obtain an earlier eviction order without notice to the Tenant.

The Tenant has not adequately explained why his arrears arose. He gave conflicting reasons for having failed to pay any rent from March, 2018 onwards. At various points, he said that he did not pay because he did not know whether he was going to be evicted; that he refused to pay until the Landlord resolved complaints that he had; and that he was not able to pay because his roommate had moved out. 11. The problem with the first two reasons is that they do not explain why the Tenant is not now able to pay his arrears. If he withheld payment because he was worried about being evicted, or because of a dispute with the Landlord, then he should now be able to make the payment. He has not explained what happened to the $7,500.00 that he withheld. 12. The third reason could provide some explanation for the arrears, but it does not explain why nothing at all has been paid for four months. The Tenant has not paid either his or his former roommate’s portion of the rent. Again, if he withheld his portion of it, he has not explained why the money is not now available to put towards his arrears. 13. In light of the Tenant’s contradictory and unsatisfactory explanations for his arrears, an eleven-month payment plan would be unreasonably long. I find that it would be unfair to the Landlord to allow it. A standard order will issue terminating the tenancy unless the full amount owing is paid in eleven days',\n",

The Landlord’s legal representative requested a conditional order requiring the Tenant to pay the amount he owes for hydroelectricity. 9.

I say this because the Landlord does not seek an eviction order. It merely wants the Tenant to pay rent on time into the future. The Tenant says she can do that and she demonstrated that by paying rent on time July 1, 2018. 7. As a result an order shall issue requiring the Tenant to pay rent on time and in full for the next 11 months. If she breaches that obligation the Landlord will be entitled to obtain an eviction order under s. 78 of the Act without a hearing or prior notice to the Tenant. 8. The only real dispute between the parties is with respect to the Landlord’s filing fee. The Landlord incurred costs of $175.00 for filing the application and seeks an order requiring the Tenant to pay the Landlord that amount. The Tenant resists such an order. 9. Part of the reason that the Tenant resists the Landlord’s request for an order requiring her to pay the filing fee is that the Landlord wrote her a letter on May 7, 2018 that understandably created some confusion. The letter had attached to it an N4 notice of termination setting out the rent arrears owing for the month of May, 2018. The Tenant voided that notice by paying the amount required by the termination date. 10. Unlike the notice of termination attached to it, the letter was not just about rent arrears. It says in part: According to our records you have been paying your rent consistently late. Please be advised that rent is due on the 1st business day of each month. Starting June 1, 2018 if the rent is not paid on time, we will serve you an N8 and start the L1 application with the courts. Please make sure you are paying your rent when it is due on the first of the month to avoid legal costs and/or eviction. This is the final notice. 11. The Tenant quite reasonably interprets this letter to mean that no notice of termination for persistent late payment of rent would issue nor would legal costs be incurred if she started paying rent on time by June 1, 2018. (That being said, the Tenant says she did not pay June’s rent in advance, less the $1.56 shortfall, because of this letter; rather that amount was paid because she happened to have it on hand due to when her pay date falls.) 12. Despite the Landlord’s letter, on May 17, 2018 it issued a notice of termination for persistent late payment and filed this application on May 25, 2018. So the Tenant was not given until June 1, 2018 to rectify matters after all and she feels that is unfair. The Tenant understands her obligation to pay rent on time and understood it before receiving the notice of termination but believes that the Landlord’s letter is sort of an offer to settle that she accepted by paying rent on time. 13. The usual approach of the Board towards the issue of costs is set out in the Board’s Interpretation Guideline 3 on Costs. It says in part: In most cases, the only costs allowed will be the application fee. This should be ordered if the applicant is successful in obtaining an order which allows the relief they asked for in the application, or substantially all of that relief. 14. In this case the Landlord has established the Tenant has been persistently late paying rent meaning it has succeeded in establishing it is entitled to the relief it sought. So the Interpretation Guideline supports the assertion the Landlord is entitled to an order for the filing fee. 15. That being said, the Board’s power to order costs including the filing fee is discretionary and the Interpretation Guideline is not binding on Board Members. That means that I have the power to refuse to order the costs be paid if doing so would not be unfair and inconsistent with the purposes of the Act. 16. The Tenant’s reasons for not wanting to pay the filing fee are not limited to the letter from the Landlord of May 7, 2018. She cannot easily afford it and she has a disabled son, which I took to mean it would be a struggle to pay it. 17. It seems to me that this would be one of the very rare instances where refusing to order the Tenant to pay the Landlord’s cost of filing the application would be consistent with the purposes of the Act and not unfair. 18. I say this because the evidence indicates that prior to May 7, 2018 the Landlord never warned the Tenant she was at risk of eviction or legal costs for persistent late payment. The letter the Landlord wrote May 7, 2018 was her first warning and it does read like an offer to settle: pay rent on time starting June 1, 2018 and you will suffer no costs or consequences. The Tenant essentially accepted that offer through her behaviour so it does seem unfair that the Landlord not be held to its offer. 19. The Act says in part that the purposes it is intended to serve include balancing the rights and responsibilities of landlords and tenants, and providing for the adjudication of disputes and for other processes to informally resolve disputes. The Landlord’s letter was an informal way of resolving the Landlord’s dispute with the Tenant and the Tenant accepted it. The Board should promote and approve of that kind of informal dispute resolution as long as it is fair and not in breach of the Act. 20. Given all of the above, I decline to order the Tenant to pay to the Landlord its cost of filing the application. 21. This order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it.

The Tenant’s proposed payment plan is unrealistic considering the extent of his indebtedness to the Landlord and others and his source of income. L2 application 1. The Landlord served the Tenant with an N7 notice to end his tenancy for seriously impairing the safety of any person. The N7 alleges that on July 17, 2018 the Tenant threatened the next door neighbour; used profanities towards him and told him he would destroy the next door neighbour’s air conditioning unit; threw garbage at the neighbour’s property, including used disposable utensils and dead plants, instead of putting them in the garbage bins. 2. The Landlord explained that the neighbour’s air conditioning unit, which services the bottom floor of the ground floor of the neighbour’s rental complex, was not functioning properly resulting in it being louder than usual. The Landlord provided hearsay evidence that on July 17, 2018 the Tenant used profanities and threatened the owner of the adjacent property with violence while the Tenant stood on his own porch. The Landlord did not personally witness this incident and the neighbour was not called as a witness and did not provide affidavit evidence. The Landlord did not refer to any of the other allegations in the N7 notice. 3. The Tenant denied he ever threatened the owner of the adjacent property. He said he told the owner his air conditioning unit makes too much noise. 4. Although he denied telling the owner of the adjacent building he would beat him up, he said he was speaking jokingly like one does playing soccer. The Tenant also said he threatened to rip out the air conditioning unit and put it on the street because it made such a racket. 5. As the applicant, the Landlord must prove that the Tenant uttered statements on July 17, 2018 that seriously impaired the safety of the neighbour. While the Landlord’s hearsay testimony about what happened on that date is admissible, it is given less weight than the Tenant’s oral testimony which is subject to cross-examination. The Tenant denied uttering threats and this evidence was not disputed by the neighbour either in person or by affidavit. As a result, the Landlord’s evidence is insufficient to establish that the Tenant seriously impaired the safety of the neighbour\",\n",

The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2018 to November 30, 2018. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 20, 2018. 8. The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 9. The monthly rent as of the date of the hearing is $1,327.74. 10. The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,327.74 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord. 11. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from June 1, 2018 to July 20, 2018. 12. The Tenants paid $6,250.00 after the application was filed. 13. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. L2 application 14. On July 12, 2018, the Landlord served the Tenant a Notice to Terminate at End of the Term for persistent late payment of rent (the ‘N8 notice’) with a termination date of September 30, 2018. 15. I find that the N8 notice is in compliance with the Act. It meets the 60 day requirement and provides sufficient details as of the reason for the notice. 16. The N8 notice alleged that the rent is due on the first day of each month and the Tenants have been late in paying rent in every month since September 1, 2016, which necessitated the Landlord serving N4 notices and filing applications at the Board on numerous occasions in order for the Tenant to pay the arrears. 17. Based on the evidence of the Landlord, including the detailed records and numerous N4 notices served on the Tenants, I am satisfied that, on a balance of probabilities, the Tenants have been persistently late in paying rent. 18. The Tenant TK does not dispute the allegations of persistent late payment of rent but explains that the Tenants did so because of mice infestation of the unit. 19. There is no evidence of the Tenants having filed a T6 application for maintenance issue before the Board, and according to the Tenant TK, the Tenants only started complaining to the Landlord about this issue since June 2018, while they have been persistently late in paying rent since September 2016. The Tenant TK also acknowledged that the Landlord has responded to the mice complaint although the Tenants are still not completely satisfied with the result. 20. Based on the Tenant TK’s testimony and the Landlord’s site manager’s evidence, I am satisfied that the Landlord responded to the Tenants’ request by calling in a pest control company which treated the unit about 1.5 weeks after receiving a written complaint from the Tenant, with subsequent treatments that followed. 21. The Ontario Court of Appeal had stated in Onyskiw v. CJM Property Management Ltd., 2016 ONCA 477, that the Landlord is not automatically in breach of its maintenance obligations under section 20 of the Act simply because there are maintenance issues with the rental unit. Rather, the reasonableness of the Landlord’s response to those issues, once made aware, should be considered when determining whether the Landlord is in breach of its maintenance obligations. 22. The evidence overall indicates that the Landlord acted promptly, reasonably and diligently in response to the Tenants’ request. As such, I find the Tenants have failed to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the Landlord has not met its obligations under subsection 20(1) of the Act to repair or maintain the rental unit and to comply with maintenance standards. 23. The evidence is also clear that the Tenants only raised this concern to the Landlord in June 2018 while they have been persistently late in paying their rent since September 2016. 24. In any case, while the Tenants can raise maintenance issues with regards to an L1 application based on non-payment of rent, this cannot be raised with respect to an L2 application based on persistent late payment of rent. S. 83 Considerations 25. The only hardship the Tenant TK raised is that it is not easy to find a new place to move to, as rent has gone up. There is no evidence of any effort of finding a new place, or what the rent differential of a comparable unit is. 26. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including the delay in the issuance of this order, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.

Tenant’s T6 application 16. The Tenants filed a T6 application alleging that the Landlord breached its maintenance obligations by failing to maintain the rental unit in manner fit for habitation. 17. Pursuant to section 29(2) of the Act, a T6 application cannot be filed more than one year after the day the alleged conduct giving rise to the application occurred. Most of the claims made in the application cannot be considered because they fall outside of this one-year limitation period, which in this case is September 24, 2017. 18. At the hearing the Tenants presented a stack of documentary evidence more than three inches thick. I directed the Tenants to draw my attention to those images and documents that they believe are necessary for me to make a finding on their claims. 19. While I am satisfied that the Tenants have established that the rental unit was in need of repair, I am not satisfied that the Tenants has established that he actually undertook the work claimed or incurred the expenses claimed. 20. The Tenant, OLK alleged that he spent $18,000.00 to repair the rental unit because of the following required repairs: (a) Exposed light bulbs in the hall way and through the unit; (b) Electrical issues - hired an electrician to repair the circuit panel; (c) Absence of fire alarms in the rental unit; (d) Humidity and mould; (e) The balcony door could not open; (f) Leaky kitchen sink; (g) Holes and leaks in walls and around the windows and drafty windows; and (h) Untidy carpet needing repair; 21. An examination of the photographs taken by the Landlords in preparation for hearing, indicates that OLK did not install any of the fixtures or undertook any of the repairs he is claiming a refund for. It was also evident through cross-examination that the Tenant had not used many of the items he purportedly purchased in the rental unit. 22. The Tenant’s evidence though copious does not allow me to conclude that they are entitled to receive a refund for the amounts claimed. The Tenant’s evidence in support of his out of pocket expenses is not reliable given the cross examination and he did not adequately refute the suggestion that many of the receipts were for items not used for the rental unit. 23. The Tenants have alleged that they stopped paying rent because they made an agreement with the Landlord to repair the unit in lieu of rent. The Tenant initially said that he made repairs worth an entire year’s rent, however, he later indicated that the unit is still in need of significant repairs. This was also confirmed by the Tenant’s own home inspection report which they obtained on December 11, 2018. The report indicates that the unit is in need of extensive upgrades, maintenance and repairs such as: i) External masonry weakness; ii) Porch slope and handrails; iii) Trees and shrubs are too close to the building; iv) Windows have cracked glazing and frames are old; v) Mold observed on the ceiling and under kitchen cabinets; vi) Kitchen exhaust fans were missing; and vii) Bathroom exhaust fan missing. 24. The OLK also claimed $9,000.00 for out of pocket expenses for meals, laundry etc. which he said the Tenants incurred because of the problems he noted in the kitchen. 25. It is alleged OLK meal receipts should not be accepted because they are inflated to mislead the Board. Mr. S testified using the OLK’s own disclosure that the OLK claimed meal expenses from Ziggys on January 8, 2019, and three separate purchases were made within 30 minutes using three separate debit cards. 26. It was also suggested using the Tenants’ evidence that the many of meal expenses were for more than 1 guest, even though the OLK lives alone. 27. Despite repeated prompts from me it was difficult to ascertain when the events which gave rise to the claims actually occurred. Given that the Landlord established that it is more likely than not that OLK has claimed expenses for items which were not actually used in the rental unit, I draw an adverse inference with respect to the Tenants’ claims and am not prepared to award any refund except as indicated below. Landlord’s evidence 28. The Landlord testified that the Tenants did not follow proper procedures when making repair or maintenance requests. The Tenants made their complaints to Mr. S who all parties agree may be suffering from early dementia. Put simply, the Landlord’s position is that the Tenant opted to raise issues with Mr. S in order to exploit his vulnerability. 29. AS testified that once the Board discovered that the Tenant had not paid rent in sometime and they received the Tenant’s T6 application, he then inspected the rental unit on or about November 10, 2018. Based on that inspection, he then served another notice of entry on November 12, 2018 and made the following repairs on that day: i) Replaced broken glass in three windows with glass orders from Remington Glass; ii) Replaced Aluminum storm sash for the window - verified that the window goes up and down but given the age of windows, they do not stay open properly; iii) Fixed the rear door of the kitchen and replaced the door knob; iv) Replaced the sweeping threshold to the kitchen door and weather stripping; v) Replaced the storm window glass with plexiglass; vi) Tightened the faucet that was leaky; vii) Fixed the shower head fixture; viii) Changed the toilet seat flap that was loose; and ix) Fixed a door frame that was loose. 30. AS also went back to the unit on February 26, 2019 after the Landlord received the professional inspection report. 31. The Landlord testified that they have repaired most to the items that needed repair in the unit. They submit remaining items are mostly cosmetic and do not interfere with OLK’s use of the unit or they are repairs which are not necessary for the rental unit to be habitable, and there is no legal requirement to modernize a rental unit. Findings on the T6 claims: 32. Without a doubt the rental unit needed significant repairs. The Landlord concedes this. 33. However, the building is over 100 years old and is habitable by those standards. The defects noted in the Tenants’ home inspection report would be of concern if the building were a newer build because building code requirements have changed. In buildings as old as the residential complex, the wiring and other elements are grandfathered and would only require compliance with the building code if updated. 34. The Tenants acknowledged this in their own submission that when they hired someone to look at the bathroom. This contractor mentioned that if he undertook the work requested, it would result in a cascade of mandatory upgrades and he was not prepared to do the work unless the legal owners requested it. 35. For this reason, while I am satisfied that the Tenants have met the evidentiary burden required to establish the rental unit was in need of repair, I am also satisfied that the Landlord responded appropriately in addressing the issues once they were brought to the Board’s attention. Further, any abatement of rent the Tenants would have been entitled to has been received by virtue of the fact that Landlord has not claimed the rent arrears owing for year 2017. Therefore, I am not granting the Tenants’ a remedy for their T6 application\",\n",

The Tenant has persistently paid her rent late. The Tenant did not contest this allegation, but noted that she is forced to pay her rent – which she does regularly in cash – at variable times such that the Landlord does not become familiar with her travel patterns so that it is in a position to harm her. 11. With respect to the L2 application, as outlined by NM, the Landlord is not seeking termination of the tenancy but asking for a conditional, “pay on time order”. 12. As stated at the hearing, I believe that a conditional “pay on time” order with respect to the L2 application is appropriate under the circumstances. 13. However, my concern with such an order is that the Tenant may be a person with a disability as defined in the Human Rights Code (“the Code”). The Tenant seems – with no reasonable basis – to be entirely convinced that the Landlord and its agents are committed to, and have devoted considerable resources and planning toward - doing her physical and financial harm. It is my obligation under the Code to accommodate the Tenant short of undue hardship. However, the Tenant neither has requested accommodation nor self-identified as a person with a disability. 14. In this context, what I believe is appropriate in light of my comments above, is to defer the start date of the conditional order with respect to the L2 application. Instead of a start date of November 1, 2018, the pay-on-time requirement will begin on December 1, 2018. 15. This delayed beginning of the requirement to pay on time shall allow the Tenant a) to get legal and other advice on the order and the requirement to pay on time; and b) to make necessary arrangements to pay her rent on time in a manner with which the Tenant feels comfortable\",\n",

I believe his evidence that he was thrown into financial chaos by the sudden and wrongful termination of his job, and it took him some time to recover from that impact. I believe it is reasonable to allow him a chance, now that he is working, to continue in his occupation of the unit by paying his future rent on time\",\n",

L2 application 8. On September 11, 2018, the Landlord served the Tenant a Notice to Terminate at End of the Term for persistent late payment of rent (the ‘N8 notice’) with a termination date of November 30, 2018. 9. The Landlord had stated in the Notice that the Tenant was late in paying his rent for June 2018, by paying the Landlord in two installments on May 1 and May 3, 2018. 10. If the Tenant had paid the rent for June 2018 in May 2018, then the Tenant could not have been late for that month. 11. At the hearing, the Landlord admitted that this was a mistake. As such, I am satisfied that the N8 notice is defective and as a result the Landlord’s L2 application shall be dismissed\",\n",

L2 application Utilities 8. The Landlord served the Tenant with an N5 notice of termination (‘N5 notice’) on September 4, 2018 by mail. Service was effective five days later on September 9, 2018. The grounds for the N5 notice were that the Tenant has substantially interfered with a lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord. The N5 notice alleges that the Tenant has failed to pay for utilities for which the Tenant is responsible. 9. Based on the Landlord’s uncontested evidence, I find that the tenancy agreement provides that the Tenant is responsible to pay for hydroelectricity and for water/sewage costs. 10. Based on the Landlord’s uncontested evidence, I find that the Tenant has not paid for the costs of hydroelectricity for the rental unit. I therefore find that the Tenant has substantially interfered with a lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord. Late payment of rent 11. The Tenant has persistently paid rent late. Section 83 12.

L2 application 7. The certificate of service provides that the Landlord gave the Tenant and N4 and N12 notice on August 27, 2018 by handing them to the Tenant however in somewhat confused testimony the Landlord said she gave the Tenant the N4 notice in August 2018 and she gave him the N12 notice in the middle of October 2018. The termination date on the N12 notice is October 31, 2018. 8. Subsections 48(1)(b) and (2) state: 48(1)A landlord may, by notice, terminate a tenancy if the landlord in good faith requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation for a period of at least one year by, (b) the landlord’s spouse; … (2)The date for termination specified in the notice shall be at least 60 days after the notice is given and shall be the day a period of the tenancy ends or, where the tenancy is for a fixed term, the end of the term. 9. As the termination date on the N12 notice must be 60 days after the Tenant is given that notice, I find the N12 notice is a nullity by virtue of the failure to comply with the requisite notice period. Accordingly, the L2 application must be denied\",\n",
