    "1.      The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from February 1, 2017 to May 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective April 17, 2017.\n",

    "3.      The Landlord incurred costs as a result of filing the application in the amount of $190.00 and is entitled to reimbursement for those costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.      At the hearing, the Board indicated to the Landlord that the notice of termination fails to identify the rental unit pursuant to the requirements outlined in subsection 43(1)(a) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2016 (the ‘Act’). As the notice of termination fails to comply with the mandatory requirements of the Act, the notice is invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.      As the notice was found to be invalid, the Landlord elected to pursue an order for arrears of rent only. An order will issue accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The L2 Application  \n",
    "\n",
    "6.      The Landlord says that the Tenant has substantially interfered with another tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex and has substantially interfered with a lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.      For the reasons that follow, I am satisfied that the Tenant’s conduct has substantially interfered with both the Landlord and the other tenant living in the residential complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.      The residential complex is a house. The Tenant lives in a bedroom in the basement, another tenant lives in a second room in the basement and the main floor is a 3 bedroom unit that is currently vacant.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.      The Landlord says that the Tenant constantly exhibits aggressive, argumentative and inappropriate behaviour towards the other tenant, towards the Landlord and towards anyone around him.\n",
    "\n",
    "10.   In support of his position, the Landlord called the other basement tenant, TG, to provide specific examples. TG provided the Board with multiple audio recordings in which the Tenant can be heard yelling extremely loudly, threatening TG and others around him, swearing, uttering racial slurs, and being belligerent, confrontational and aggressive.\n",
    "\n",
    "11.   Both the Landlord and TG say they have personally witnessed the Tenant conducting himself in this way on multiple occasions on an almost daily basis both inside the house and outside in the yard and garage.\n",
    "\n",
    "12.   The Landlord provided the Board with a list of dates and specific examples which TG had sent to him. The list contains 9 specific dates from September 2016 to early March 2017, and descriptions of the Tenant threatening, swearing, yelling, insulting, uttering racial slurs and uttering homophobic slurs towards TG.  Both the Landlord and TG say that this is not an exhaustive list; the Tenant continuously engages in this behaviour and has become impossible to endure.\n",
    "\n",
    "13.   In addition, the Landlord says that the Tenant’s behaviour has prevented him from renting the main floor of the house. The Landlord says he is concerned that a family might move into the 3 bedroom unit and then be subject to the Tenant’s confrontational, threatening and belligerent behaviour. The Landlord says he is currently suffering a financial loss because he is worried about the negative effect the Tenant’s behaviour might have on any new tenants moving into the house.\n",
    "\n",
    "14.   Based on the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the Tenant’s conduct is substantially interfering with both the basement tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of his unit as well as the Landlord’s lawful right privilege or interest. As a result, the Landlord’s application must be granted.\n",
    "\n",
    "15.   I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.\n",

    "\n",
    "3.      The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $21.37 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting May 27, 2017 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.      The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.      If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 6, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June 7, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.\n",

The Landlord says he is currently suffering a financial loss because he is worried about the negative effect the Tenant’s behaviour might have on any new tenants moving into the house. 14.   Based on the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the Tenant’s conduct is substantially interfering with both the basement tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of his unit as well as the Landlord’s lawful right privilege or interest. As a result, the Landlord’s application must be granted. 15.   I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. It is ordered that: 1.      The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before June 6, 2017. 2.      The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,856.72*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to May 26, 2017. 3.      The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $21.37 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting May 27, 2017 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit. 4.      The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application. 5.      If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 6, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June 7, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding. 6.      If the unit is not vacated on or before June 6, 2017, then starting June 7, 2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced. 7.      Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 7, 2017. May 26, 2017                                                                    _______________________ Date Issued                                                                     Laura Hartslief Member, Landlord and Tenant Board Toronto East-RO 2275 Midland Avenue, Unit 2 Toronto ON M1P3E7 If you have any questions about this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234. In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on December 7, 2017 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located. *           Refer to section A on the attached Summary of Calculations.
