       "[\"The N5 Notice has a termination date of November 17, 2016 and alleges that the conduct of the Tenant substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex and the Tenant has wilfully or negligently damaged the rental unit or residential complex. 5. The N5 Notice sets out the dates, times and specific allegations against the Tenant. 6. Because this is a first N5 Notice, the Tenant has an opportunity to void the notice in accordance with section 64(3) of the Act by correcting the identified problems within seven days of the date the notice was served. In this case, the seven day period begins the day following service of the N5 Notice, from October 28th to November 3rd, 2016. The Landlord's Legal Representative confirmed that the first N5 Notice was not voided because the conduct has not stopped since the notice was served and the Tenant has not paid $500.00 required to replace or replace the damaged property. Window screens 7. The Tenant negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit and residential complex by damaging the screens on two windows and the patio door. The photos submitted into evidence support a finding of negligence because the screens were badly torn which did not occur from usual wear and tear. The Landlord is entitled to the cost claimed of $300.00 to repair the window screens. The Landlord provided an invoice to support this claim. Conduct issues 8. The conduct of the Tenant substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the Landlord and other tenant for the following reasons: 9. The City of Mississauga issued a Notice of Contravention in April 2016 regarding debris located on the property because of the Tenant’s failure to properly store her garbage. A copy of the Notice was submitted; 10. The City of Mississauga also informed the Landlord about a noise complaint because the Tenant’s dog was barking for hours while left unattended in the backyard disturbing the neighbours. The Landlord submitted a copy of this letter into evidence; 11. Based on the testimony of the Landlord, the Tenant parks in the adjacent neighbour’s driveway and the Landlord receives complaints from the neighbour; 12. On August 29th the Tenant left her dog unattended in a common area of the residential complex and the Landlord was unable to show the unit to prospective renters. The Tenant fails to respond to the Landlord’s requests to control her dog. The Landlord submitted a text message sent to the Tenant regarding this issue on October 27th; 13. The Tenant installed a lock on the gate to the shared backyard and refused to remove the lock. The Landlord submitted a text message sent to the Tenant on August 23rd requesting a key to which the Tenant responded with foul language to leave her alone. Consequently the Landlord changed the lock and provided the tenants with keys; 14. The Tenant changed the lock on the entry door to the basement unit without the Landlord’s consent. Section 35 of the Act specifies that a tenant shall not alter the locking system on a door giving entry to a rental unit or residential complex without the consent of the Landlord. The Landlord is entitled to her costs for installing a new lock of $200.00 which she supported with an invoice; 15. The Tenant leaves her clothes in the laundry room and leaves kitty litter under the sink such that it interferes with the use of the laundry room by the other tenant. The Landlord has received numerous complaints from the other tenant regarding inability to do laundry and despite the creation of a laundry schedule, the issue continues. Photos of the laundry room and text messages reporting the issues were submitted into evidence; 16. The Tenant plays loud music and makes excessive noise at late hours. These incidents occurred on November 21st, 25th and 29th and continue on a regular basis. The Tenant yells and swears at the Landlord and the downstairs tenant. In support of this testimony, the Landlord submitted text messages. The downstairs tenant, LD testified about the ongoing issues with interference with laundry, loud arguments with the tenant and the tenant’s threat to turn her dog loose on him. LD also played an audio of one of the arguments in which the Tenant was heard yelling loudly and aggressively. He said the Tenant also forced open the entry door to his unit in November and began screaming at him. LD called the police; 17. LD also testified that he complained to the City of Mississauga about the noise but the Tenant’s behaviour continues. He said he would move out if the Tenant continues to live at the rental unit. Illegal Act (N6) 18. On October 27, 2016, the Landlord served the Tenant with an N6 Notice to End your Tenancy for Illegal Acts in accordance with section 61(1) of the Act. The N6 Notice has a termination date of November 17, 2016 and alleges that the Tenant physically assaulted the downstairs tenant on October 22, 2016. 19. The Tenant committed an illegal act by placing her fingers on LD’s face and pushing him on September 17th, 2016 which constitutes assault. The police were called. While the notice specified that an assault occurred on October 22nd, 2016 the testimony was that the conduct complained of occurred on September 17th. However the notice provided the Tenant with sufficient details to understand the allegation. Relief from eviction 20. The Landlord seeks eviction as soon as possible. The other tenant intends to move because of the unrelenting issues he experiences on a daily basis because of the Tenant’s conduct. 21. No circumstances were disclosed in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act to consider relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act\",\n",
       " \"I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. I am allowing the payment plan suggested by the Tenant and the prejudice to the Landlord is minimized by the provisions of section 78. of the Act\",\n",

This tenancy just commenced in July 2016 and the Tenant has been unable or unwilling to pay the rent on time and/or in full each month since then. A prior L1 rent arrears order was issued in October 2016. The Tenant was able to pay the amount owing by the date in the order which voided the order. However, immediately after that, he fell into arrears for the November rent. 19. The Tenant stated he was injured in an accident shortly after he moved in and was off work. However, he is now back at work and hopes to pay the amount owing by the end of February. 20. The Tenant still has the option set out below in paragraph 9 of the order if he wants to preserve this tenancy\",\n",
       " \"I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsections 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. I have extended the termination date to February 28th to allow the Tenants time to seek out other resources which may be available to them to void the arrears portion of the order. This extension is only two weeks longer than requested by the Landlord's Legal Representative to reduce the prejudice to the Landlord. The Tenants are required to void the rent arrears portion of the order to benefit from a condition to pay the rent on time with a section 78 provision where the Landlord can file for eviction if a payment of rent is late without notice to the Tenants\",\n",
       " 'On December 2, 2016, the Landlord served the Tenant with an N5 Notice in accordance with sub sections 64(1) and 62(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). The N5 Notice has a termination date of December 22, 2016 and alleges that: a) The Tenant is harassing and substantially interfering with the reasonable enjoyment of the Landlord through numerous phone calls, voicemails and unannounced visits to the Landlord’s home; b) The Tenant damaged the front room ceiling, walls and floor due to “brewing kegs of homemade wine” which exploded all over the room. The Landlord claimed $320.00 to repair the alleged property damage. 4. The N5 Notice sets out the dates, times and specific allegations against the Tenant. 5. Because this is a first N5 Notice, the Tenant has an opportunity to void the notice in accordance with sub section 64(3) of the Act by correcting the identified problems within seven days of the date the notice was served. In this case, the seven day period begins the day following service of the N5 Notice, from December 3, 2016 to December 9, 2016. The Landlord confirmed that the N5 Notice was not voided and that the Tenant did not pay $320.00 for the alleged damages claimed in the N5 notice. 6. The Landlord testified: a) The Tenant is her biological father; b) The Tenant was brewing wine in the front room of the home and the red wine “exploded” and stained the ceiling, walls and floor. The Landlord submitted photos of the front room; c) The Landlord gave notice to enter to replace the battery for the furnace and the Tenant denied entry and police were called; d) The Tenant is not co-operative and verbally abusive such that the Landlord went to the police. He withheld rent in return for personal favours, forced his way in and used the Landlord’s cottage, requested help in paying bills and constantly calls the Landlord with unreasonable requests. He does not respect boundaries. He caused a “scene” when the roof was re-shingled and damaged the workers’ truck. When he comes to her house, he throws temper tantrums. 7. The Tenant admitted responsibility for the red wine stains on the ceiling of the front room. He testified that the container of red wine was corked and the cork popped causing wine to spray on the ceiling. He said he paid his grandson to clean the stains. Wilful or negligent damage – front room 8. Section 62(1) of the Act states that a landlord may give a tenant notice of termination if the tenant wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to the rental unit. 9. I am not satisfied that the conduct of the Tenant was negligent or that the wine stains on the ceiling is representative of undue damage. 10. “Conduct is negligent if there is a risk of damage which a reasonable person would take reasonable precautions against” (Bolton v. Stone [1951] A.C. 850). Further, “If a person reasonably, albeit mistakenly, believes that there is no risk then the conduct is not negligent” (Beutler v. Beutler [1983] O.J. No. 505 at para. 148). 11. Wilful conduct means with intent or deliberate. 12. The Tenant placed a cork in the container of wine which shows that he took reasonable precautions against spillage. The fact that the cork popped and caused the wine to spray the ceiling and spill onto the floor was not reasonably foreseeable. As a consequence, the Tenant’s conduct was not negligent. The facts do not demonstrate any intent by the Tenant to spray wine on the ceiling and floor. 13. I am not satisfied that the stains on the ceiling and the faint spot on the floor are representative of undue damage. Undue suggests some damage is acceptable. The stains on the ceiling and floor are akin to normal wear and tear. 14. As the Landlord has not met the test under section 62(1), this claim is dismissed. In any event, the Landlord did not substantiate the remedy claimed of $320.00 with a quote or other similar evidence. 15. The Landlord’s claim regarding damage caused by hooks on a ceiling beam is dismissed because the Landlord did not explain how the hooks caused undue damage. Substantial interference 16. Asking someone to read your mail to them, show them how to pay bills, smoke fish for them and not respecting boundaries indicates that the Landlord’s allegations are representative of personal issues between members of a family rather than those between a Landlord and Tenant. This does not represent substantial interference of reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex by the Landlord or harassment and this claim is dismissed. 17. The issues claimed by the Landlord that occurred at her home did not occur at the residential complex and therefore do not substantially interfere with her reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex. This claim is dismissed. 18. The Landlord’s claim that the Tenant damaged the roofing worker’s truck is dismissed. The Landlord did not provide sufficient details regarding this claim or any supporting evidence regarding this alleged damage. 19. The Landlord did not provide sufficient details such as dates and times, to support a finding of harassment or substantial interference regarding her complaints that the Tenant demanded she come over to change a light bulb, wanted a new kitchen tap and made numerous calls regarding the thermostat “flashing”. These claims are dismissed. 20. The Landlord failed to substantiate her claim regarding denial of entry to the rental unit to replace the battery for the furnace on December 1, 2016. A notice to enter was not provided and no details regarding police involvement were submitted. In any event, a single event is not indicative of substantial interference. This claim is dismissed. 21. The Landlord led evidence that the Tenant failed to maintain the unit in a state of ordinary cleanliness. However, these issues were not raised in the N5 Notices which formed the basis of the L2 Application and are not relevant to a finding of a substantial interference or wilful or negligent damage. Regarding L2 Application (N12 Notice – Landlord own use) 22. The Landlord served the Tenant with an N12 notice of termination effective January 31, 2017 claiming the Landlord intended to move into the rental unit. 23. The Landlord testified that she intends to move into the rental unit to use the unit for her home based business and for other business purposes. 24. Subsection 48(1) of the Act states: A landlord may, by notice, terminate a tenancy if the landlord in good faith requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation by, (a) the landlord; (b) the landlord’s spouse; (c) a child or parent of the landlord or the landlord’s spouse; or (d) a person who provides or will provide care services to the landlord, the landlord’s spouse, or a child or parent of the landlord or the landlord’s spouse, if the person receiving the care services resides or will reside in the building, related group of buildings, mobile home park or land lease community in which the rental unit is located. 25. The term “residential occupation” is not defined in the Act. However, the Court has stated in various decisions that residential occupation is generally understood to mean the property will be used as the person’s main residence and requires more than occasional or temporary use of the unit. 26. Based on the Landlord’s evidence, the test of residential occupation has not been met. It is clear from the Landlord’s own evidence that the property will not be the main residence of the Landlord and she intends to use the unit for business purposes, not residential occupation. This claim is dismissed. Relief from eviction (L1 Application) 27. The Tenant testified that his source of income is retirement benefits of about $1,800 per month. He has a hearing impairment and relies on oxygen for breathing purposes. If evicted, he requested until April to find another home. 28. The Landlord said that she will lose her house if the arrears are not paid because she is using credit to pay bills and the mortgage. 29. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. 30. In granting relief, I am taking into account the submissions of the Landlord and her financial obligations, and balancing that against the Tenant’s disclosed circumstances. Therefore the relief from eviction is subject to conditions set out in this order which, if not met, would allow the Landlord to apply to the Board, without further notice to the Tenant, for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant pursuant to section 78 of the Act',\n",
       " \"I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. 24. The Tenant stated that she is looking for a new place to move and wants to move as soon as possible but, as of the hearing date, she was not certain of an exact date she will be moving. She is currently unable to make any payment towards the three months of rent that are owing. As a result, termination of the tenancy is ordered\",\n",
       " \"I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until April 20, 2017 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. This is 12 days longer than the 11 day standard order requested by the Landlord, a short delay to reduce the prejudice to the Landlord\",\n",
       " \"I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. No rent has been paid since February. There are over seven months of rent owing to the Landlord. The Tenant did not comply with the interim order. The interim order was meant to ensure that the amount of rent arrears ordered in March did not increase when April rent came due. Yet, that was not accomplished. No amount was paid to the Board. The Tenant said he is currently unable to pay the April rent\"]"
