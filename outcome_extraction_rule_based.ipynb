      "The N5 Notice has a termination date of November 17, 2016 and alleges that the conduct of the Tenant substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex and the Tenant has wilfully or negligently damaged the rental unit or residential complex. 5. The N5 Notice sets out the dates, times and specific allegations against the Tenant. 6. Because this is a first N5 Notice, the Tenant has an opportunity to void the notice in accordance with section 64(3) of the Act by correcting the identified problems within seven days of the date the notice was served. In this case, the seven day period begins the day following service of the N5 Notice, from October 28th to November 3rd, 2016. The Landlord's Legal Representative confirmed that the first N5 Notice was not voided because the conduct has not stopped since the notice was served and the Tenant has not paid $500.00 required to replace or replace the damaged property. Window screens 7. The Tenant negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit and residential complex by damaging the screens on two windows and the patio door. The photos submitted into evidence support a finding of negligence because the screens were badly torn which did not occur from usual wear and tear. The Landlord is entitled to the cost claimed of $300.00 to repair the window screens. The Landlord provided an invoice to support this claim. Conduct issues 8. The conduct of the Tenant substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the Landlord and other tenant for the following reasons: 9. The City of Mississauga issued a Notice of Contravention in April 2016 regarding debris located on the property because of the Tenant’s failure to properly store her garbage. A copy of the Notice was submitted; 10. The City of Mississauga also informed the Landlord about a noise complaint because the Tenant’s dog was barking for hours while left unattended in the backyard disturbing the neighbours. The Landlord submitted a copy of this letter into evidence; 11. Based on the testimony of the Landlord, the Tenant parks in the adjacent neighbour’s driveway and the Landlord receives complaints from the neighbour; 12. On August 29th the Tenant left her dog unattended in a common area of the residential complex and the Landlord was unable to show the unit to prospective renters. The Tenant fails to respond to the Landlord’s requests to control her dog. The Landlord submitted a text message sent to the Tenant regarding this issue on October 27th; 13. The Tenant installed a lock on the gate to the shared backyard and refused to remove the lock. The Landlord submitted a text message sent to the Tenant on August 23rd requesting a key to which the Tenant responded with foul language to leave her alone. Consequently the Landlord changed the lock and provided the tenants with keys; 14. The Tenant changed the lock on the entry door to the basement unit without the Landlord’s consent. Section 35 of the Act specifies that a tenant shall not alter the locking system on a door giving entry to a rental unit or residential complex without the consent of the Landlord. The Landlord is entitled to her costs for installing a new lock of $200.00 which she supported with an invoice; 15. The Tenant leaves her clothes in the laundry room and leaves kitty litter under the sink such that it interferes with the use of the laundry room by the other tenant. The Landlord has received numerous complaints from the other tenant regarding inability to do laundry and despite the creation of a laundry schedule, the issue continues. Photos of the laundry room and text messages reporting the issues were submitted into evidence; 16. The Tenant plays loud music and makes excessive noise at late hours. These incidents occurred on November 21st, 25th and 29th and continue on a regular basis. The Tenant yells and swears at the Landlord and the downstairs tenant. In support of this testimony, the Landlord submitted text messages. The downstairs tenant, LD testified about the ongoing issues with interference with laundry, loud arguments with the tenant and the tenant’s threat to turn her dog loose on him. LD also played an audio of one of the arguments in which the Tenant was heard yelling loudly and aggressively. He said the Tenant also forced open the entry door to his unit in November and began screaming at him. LD called the police; 17. LD also testified that he complained to the City of Mississauga about the noise but the Tenant’s behaviour continues. He said he would move out if the Tenant continues to live at the rental unit. Illegal Act (N6) 18. On October 27, 2016, the Landlord served the Tenant with an N6 Notice to End your Tenancy for Illegal Acts in accordance with section 61(1) of the Act. The N6 Notice has a termination date of November 17, 2016 and alleges that the Tenant physically assaulted the downstairs tenant on October 22, 2016. 19. The Tenant committed an illegal act by placing her fingers on LD’s face and pushing him on September 17th, 2016 which constitutes assault. The police were called. While the notice specified that an assault occurred on October 22nd, 2016 the testimony was that the conduct complained of occurred on September 17th. However the notice provided the Tenant with sufficient details to understand the allegation. Relief from eviction 20. The Landlord seeks eviction as soon as possible. The other tenant intends to move because of the unrelenting issues he experiences on a daily basis because of the Tenant’s conduct. 21. No circumstances were disclosed in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act to consider relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act\n",

      "I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. I am allowing the payment plan suggested by the Tenant and the prejudice to the Landlord is minimized by the provisions of section 78. of the Act\n",

This tenancy just commenced in July 2016 and the Tenant has been unable or unwilling to pay the rent on time and/or in full each month since then. A prior L1 rent arrears order was issued in October 2016. The Tenant was able to pay the amount owing by the date in the order which voided the order. However, immediately after that, he fell into arrears for the November rent. 19. The Tenant stated he was injured in an accident shortly after he moved in and was off work. However, he is now back at work and hopes to pay the amount owing by the end of February. 20. The Tenant still has the option set out below in paragraph 9 of the order if he wants to preserve this tenancy\n",
