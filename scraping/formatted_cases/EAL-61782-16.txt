J. D. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict R. F. and D. G. (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Kingston on
January 18, 2017.
 
The Landlord’s Legal
Representative, J. M. (JM), one of the Tenants, R. F. (RF), and his
representative, R. D. (RD), attended the hearing.  The other Tenant, D. G.
(DG), was neither present, nor represented.
 
Preliminary Matter
at Issue:
 

The preliminary issue
     that the Board was asked to address is whether RF was in possession of the
     rental unit on the date that the Landlord’s application was filed with the
     Board. Section 87 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
     ‘Act’) indicates that a Landlord’s application for payment of arrears of
     rent can only be made in respect of a tenant who is in possession of the
     rental unit. The application was filed with the Board on December 2, 2016.
     There is no dispute that DG was in possession of the rental unit on that date.
     The application can therefore proceed against DG.

 

According to RF, he
     vacated the rental unit on October 1st, two months before the
     Landlord’s application was filed. The Landlord acknowledges that RF was no
     longer residing at the rental unit but claims that the tenancy was never
     terminated and that RF was still in possession.

 

I am satisfied that
     the facts indicate that RF was no longer in possession of the rental unit on
     the date that the Landlord’s application was filed with the Board. RF can
     therefore not be held liable for the rent arrears in this proceeding. The
     application is amended by removing RF as a party. 

 
 
Evidence and
Determinations on whether RF was in possession of the rental unit:
 
The Landlord’s
Evidence and Submissions
 

The Landlord’s only
     witness was Z. B. (ZB), who is employed as a rental agent by the Landlord.
     He indicated that the Tenants and the Landlord had entered into a 12-month
     lease from October 1, 2015 to September 30, 2016. The lease contained a
     clause indicating that the Tenants were “jointly and severally liable
     for the payment of all rent”. On June 20, 2016, the Landlord provided
     a notice of rent increase to RF and DG. The rent increase was to come into
     effect on October 1, 2016. The lease was automatically renewed on that
     date on a month-to-month basis since the Landlord did not receive a notice
     to terminate from the Tenants.

 

Shortly before August
     11th, RF sent an email message to ZB indicating that he would
     be vacating the rental unit.  ZB responded on August 11th that
     the Landlord required both tenants to sign the notice to vacate in order
     to end the tenancy.

 

RF responded later
     that day that he would pay rent to the end of the term but felt that had
     to move out as soon as possible because he did not feel safe living with
     DG. ZB responded that the Landlord would not be prepared to release RF
     from the tenancy “without proof that anything happened”.

 

On September 20th,
     RF sent an email message to ZB informing him that he would be moving out
     of the rental unit on October 1st. ZB responded to him that it
     was his responsibility find a replacement tenant, failing which both he
     and DG would have to “provide written 60 days’ notice to vacate so that
     we can advertise the property to re-rent”.

 

The Landlord’s
     representative submitted that the tenancy remained in effect. RF could not
     terminate the tenancy on his own. Both tenants had to sign a written
     notice of termination, which had not been done in this case.  

 

The Landlord’s
     representative also argued that RF remained in possession of the rental
     unit after he moved out because he did not return his keys to the
     Landlord. In the event that RF had reconciled with DG, there was nothing
     preventing him from returning to the unit and resuming occupancy. 

 
 
 
RF’s evidence and submissions
 

RF testified that he
     signed a new lease for another rental property effective October 1, 2016.
     He provided the Board with a partial copy of his new lease agreement. He
     also  stated that he made arrangements with Canada Post to have his mail
     redirected to his new address.

 

RF explained that
     there had been growing animosity between himself and DG. He was concerned
     that DG would become violent.

 

When he vacated the
     rental unit on October 1st, he left his keys to the unit with
     DG. He also stated that he left him a payment for his share of the rent
     for the month of October. 

 

The Tenant’s
     representative argued that RF was no longer in possession of the rental
     unit once he moved out. He noted that RF had given ample notice to the
     Landlord of his intention that he would be leaving the rental unit on
     October 1st. The fact that he did not return his key to the
     Landlord was immaterial since he left it in the rental unit. The Tenant’s
     representative referred to the Court of Appeal’s decision in 1162994
     Ontario Inc. v. Bakker et al. [2004] O.J. No. 2565  (‘Bakker’) in support of his
     position that a determination could be made that RF was no longer in
     possession of the rental unit after October 1st. 

 
Analysis and Determinations
 

The Bakker decision
     is the leading case on the issue of whether a tenant is in possession of
     the rental unit. The Court defined “possession” as referring “to some
     form of control over that unit as demonstrated by factors such as access
     to, use of, or occupation of the unit”.

 

While RF did not
     return his keys to the Landlord, he surrendered them to DG inside the
     rental unit. In theory, there may be some truth to the Landlord’s
     contention that RF would be able to regain control of the rental unit if
     DG were to return his keys to him. However, the issue of whether a Tenant
     is in possession must be based on the facts, rather than on speculation as
     to what might happen in the future. 

 

Through all of his
     actions between August 11th and October 1st, RF
     signalled his intention to the Landlord to vacate the rental unit. He
     carried through on his undertaking to vacate the unit on October 1st
     and the Landlord was fully aware that RF was no longer occupying the
     rental unit after that date. There is no suggestion that any of RF’s
     personal effects remained in the unit after October 1st, that
     he returned to the unit for any length of time after that date or signalled
     an intention to come back to the unit at any time in the future. The facts
     are that RF gave up his right to access, use or occupy the unit when he
     surrendered his keys to DG.

 

The fact that the
     tenancy has not been terminated does not in and of itself constitute a legitimate
     basis for the Landlord to proceed with its application against both
     tenants, not just the one tenant who remained in possession at the time
     the application was filed with the Board. In determining whether the
     Landlord’s application complies with section 87 of the Act, the only
     question that can be considered is whether each of the tenants named in
     the application were in possession at the time the application was filed
     with the Board. 

 

Regardless of whether
     or not RF is still a tenant at this rental unit, the Board does not have
     jurisdiction to order that he be held jointly liable for the rent arrears as
     he was no longer in possession of the rental unit.

 
Determinations on
DG’s liability for the rent arrears:
 
1.      DG
has not paid the total rent he was required to pay for the period from November
1, 2016 to January 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a
Notice of Termination effective November 29, 2016.
2.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,350.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
3.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from August 13, 2015
to November 29, 2016.
4.     DG is in
possession of the rental unit. 
5.     The
monthly rent is $1,377.00
6.     The
Landlord is holding a last month's rent deposit of $1,350.00. 
7.     DG has
paid $3,000.00 since the application was filed. 
8.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
DG voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the
Tenants is terminated.  DG must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 3, 2017.
2.      DG
shall pay to the Landlord $1,436.30*, which represents the amount of rent owing
and compensation up to January 23, 2017, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      DG
shall also pay to the Landlord $45.27 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 24, 2017 to the date he moves out of the unit.
4.      DG
shall also pay to the Landlord $170.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.      If
DG does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 3,
2017, DG will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated
from February 4, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 3, 2017, then starting February
4, 2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 4,
2017.
8.      If
DG wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, he must pay to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $501.60 if the payment is made on or before January 31, 2017, or
ii)       $1,878.60 if the payment is made on or before February 3, 2017**.
If DG does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.        
DG may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the
Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that
subsection on or after February 4, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant
possession to the Landlord. DG is only entitled to make this motion once during
the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
