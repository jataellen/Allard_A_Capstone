P.D.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict S.C.
and M.C. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe. (L-1 Application)
 
AND
 
P.D.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict S.C.
and M.C. (the 'Tenants') because the purchaser of the rental unit requires the
rental unit for the purposes of residential occupation. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date. (L-2 Application)
These applications were heard in Belleville on
July 6, 2018. Only the Landlord and Landlord’s Representative, S.P. attended the hearing. The
Tenants were not present at the hearing although the Board’s file indicates
that the Notice of Hearing was mailed to the Tenants at the address of the rental
unit. 
 
There is no indication on the Board’s file that the Tenants
contacted the Board or the Landlord prior to the scheduled hearing to request
an adjournment or to provide a reasonable explanation for their inability to
attend the hearing.
 
Determinations (L-1 Application):
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from January 1, 2017 to July 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective May 12, 2018.
2.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before July 24, 2018.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $11,059.97*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to July 13, 2018.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $19.73 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting July 14, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before July
24, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from July 25, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before July 24, 2018, then starting July 25,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 25, 2018.
8.      If,
on or before July 24, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $11,590.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after July 25, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
Determinations
L-2 Application:
1.     
The Landlord in good faith requires possession of the rental unit
for the purpose of residential occupation.
2.     
The Landlord served the Tenants with a Notice to Terminate a Tenancy
at the End of the Term for the Purchaser’s Own Use Form N12. Landlord
provided the Tenants with a 60 day notice as required by the Act and the
termination date was correctly noted as being at the end of the rental period.
3.     
The Landlord submitted the required Affidavit signed by a
Commissioner, which identified that the use of the rental unit was required by the Landlords’ son in good faith.
4.     
The Landlord testified at the hearing that the rental unit was
required for the Purchaser’s own use. 
5.     
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance
with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Even though the Tenants void part 1 of this order as outlined
above, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated, as of
July 24, 2018. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before July
24, 2018.
 
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $256.49, which represents
compensation for the use of the unit from July 1, 2018 to July 13, 2018. 
 
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $19.73 per day for
compensation for the use of the unit from July 14, 2018 to the date they move
out of the unit.
 
4.     
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or
before July 24, 2018, they will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from July 25, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
5.     
If the unit is not vacated on or before July 24, 2018, then
starting July 25, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after
July 25, 2018.
 
7.     
The Landlord has the right, at any time, to collect the full
amount owing or any balance outstanding under this Order.
