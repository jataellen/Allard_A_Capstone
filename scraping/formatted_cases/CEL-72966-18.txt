Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 











 
 
 

YKC (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict VT (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Mississauga on February
21, 2018.
 
The Landlord together with her
Paralegal, IB, and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations and Reasons:
 
1.     
The residential
tenancy agreement for the rental unit, which is a condominium, was entered into
on October 1, 2011 at a monthly rent of $1,290 payable by first day of each
month. There is no dispute that the Landlord’s daughter is the person to whom
all rent cheques were made payable by the Tenant. Nevertheless, the Landlord
would appear to have agreed to assume the obligation of landlord under the
tenancy agreement as she and her daughter were named without objection as
Landlords in an application by the Tenant and she has filed this application as
the sole landlord of the rental unit
2.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from January 1, 2017
to February 28, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective January 18, 2018.
3.     
There is no dispute the arrears of rent as at the end of February
2018 are $2,631.60 plus the application fee of $175.00.
4.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,340 and also a key deposit of $150.00. It was not disputed
that the latter was obtained contrary to subparagraph 134(1)(a) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “RTA”). These deposits totalling $1,440.00 from
the Tenant are still being held by the Landlord.
5.     
In addition, interest on the
rent deposit and key deposit are owing to the Tenant for the period from August
19, 2011 to January 18, 2018.
 Missing
rent cheques
6.      I
find the Tenant has not established that she affixed an envelope containing two
cheques on her door which the Landlord has collected but failed to deposit.
Similarly, I am not satisfied the Tenant affixed her rent cheque for February
to her door as she claimed.
7.      The
Tenant stated she issued her cheque number 88 dated December 27, 2017 for $2 representing a shortfall with respect to
the December rent and another cheque number 89 for the January rent in the
amount of $1,315.80. She said she put both of them in an envelope which she
affixed to the door of the rental unit, as was her practice from time to time.
She said she was out of town from December 27, 2017 to January 3, 2018. When
she returned, the envelope had been removed. She also said never in the six and
one-half years she has lived in her building have her envelopes with rent
cheques in them been removed from the door by an unauthorized person in this
secure building. Indeed, she stated she left pay cheques for her bookkeeping
clients on her door and never did they go missing. 
8.      The
Landlord claimed she did not see an envelope when she went to the rental unit
on January 2, 2018. She said she sent a text message to the Tenant regarding
the whereabouts of the December rent cheque and in that message she told the
Tenant she would come by on January 4th at 7:00 p.m. to obtain it.
She said she sent her husband to the rental unit on January 4th or
5th to retrieve the rent cheque but it was not on the door. He knocked on the
door but there was no response. The Landlord said she received a text message
from the Tenant stating her husband was never to knock on her door or else she
would call the police or words to that effect. 
9.      The
Tenant explained the reason she sent the text message was because she is a
single mother and she was away from
the rental unit when the Landlord’s husband repeatedly knocked on her door for
what her children, who were alone inside, estimated was for five minutes, and
he tried to enter the locked door. Although such behaviour is not to be
condoned, I am satisfied that it is more consistent with the Landlord not
having obtained the rent cheque for December 2017 than it is that she retrieved
it from the door of the rental unit but refused to cash it as the Tenant
alleges. 
10.   The Tenant is not
willing to provide the Landlord with post-dated cheques for her rent and the
concierge at her building is unwilling to hold her rent cheques for her
Landlord. 
Relief from eviction
11.   I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the RTA and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
the Act. The Tenant has engaged in a pattern of failing to pay rent and is
unwilling to provide the Landlord with post-dated cheques for future rent that
comes due and owing. 
12.   Section 83(3) of the
Act requires the Landlord and Tenant Board (LTB) to deny an eviction
application if the landlord is in serious breach of the landlord’s obligations
under the Act, As discussed below, the Tenant asserts that the Landlord has
been doing everything in her power to terminate the tenancy after the Tenant
launched complaints against the Landlord, including not addressing repairs
ordered by the Board and serving her with multiple notices of termination.  I
find that the Landlord is not in serious breach of her obligations under the
Act.
Failure to complete requires repairs
13.   The Tenant’s application
against the Landlord resulted in an Order CET-68675-17 being issued by the LTB
on October 19, 2017 requiring the Landlord and her daughter on or before November 30, 2017 to (a) repair or replace
the dryer venting duct system, the kitchen cabinets and the areas of the
hardwood floor that are curling; and (b) inspect and complete any necessary
repairs/replacements/treatments for carpeting, kitchen faucet, mould/residue in
the bathroom, laundry closet door, and address an insect infestation. The
Tenant stated that other than repairing the laundry door, Order CET-68675-17 has
been ignored by the Landlord and her daughter.
14.   With respect to
non-compliance with Order CET-68675-17, the Landlord’s evidence was that
because the dryer venting system is part of the common area, by virtue of one
of the condominium by-laws by which the rental unit owner and occupants are
bound, repairs to it have to be done by the condominium association and (or)
the manager of the building. However, neither of those entities would accept
responsibility. According to the Landlords, both of them are defendants in a
Small Claims Court action to sort out responsibility for those repairs by which
I took them to mean they are litigating this issue in a court of competent
jurisdiction. According to the Landlords, as all of the other repairs and
replacements relate to the dryer venting system, only the laundry closet door
could be repaired, which was done.
15.   By letter dated
January 1, 2018, the Tenant wrote to the Landlord’s daughter asking for
receipts for all of her rent payments from the beginning of her tenancy; demanding
that she be given a rent receipt monthly; requiring interest be paid on her
last month’s rent deposit; and asked for repayment of money paid as a key
deposit. Although she noted that the picture window in the living room leaks
when it rains, there was no mention
of non-compliance with Order CET-68675-17 , though one would reasonably expect
if the Tenant was questioning the capacity of the Landlord to comply, it would
have featured in that demand letter containing complaints regarding other
Landlord infractions of the tenancy relationship. 
16.   It was also stated
that on two occasions the Tenant refused to let a representative of the manager
of the condominium building and the Landlord inspect her rental unit. The
Tenant admitted to having received a text message that someone would be coming
to inspect but she claimed she did not get the message regarding what I took to
be the exact time they would be there and therefore she was out when they came.

17.   Without limiting the
Landlord’s obligation to comply with Order CET-68675-17, I am satisfied the
Landlord was unable to timely effect the outstanding repairs through no fault
of her own and that the laundry closet door was timely repaired. Therefore, I
do not find that the Landlord is in serious breach of her maintenance
obligations.
Service of multiple N12 notices
18.   While the Tenant was
pursuing her application at the Board, the Landlord served her with an N12
notice of termination for Landlord’s own use with a termination date of
September 30, 2017. Subsequently, she was given another N12 calling for her
tenancy to terminate on October 1, 2017. These two notices were served prior to
the Order CET-68675-17.  . 
19.   The Tenant continued
to receive N12 notices for termination of her tenancy. One N12 was for
termination effective on October 31, 2017 and then another for termination on
January 18, 2018 and yet another was for termination to take effect on March
31, 2018 – in all, a total of three N12s were given to the Tenant after the
Order CET-68675-17. In each instance, the stated purpose was that the Landlord
requires the residence for her own use.
20.   While there is no
definition of “harassment” in the RTA, it is generally held that “harassment”
is a course of conduct that a reasonable person knows or ought to know would be
unwelcome.
21.   At the hearing the
Tenant relied on the series of N12 notices to show the Landlord was doing all
she could to remove her from her rental unit. Although the Landlords did not
provide any evidence of their intended personal use of the rental unit neither
did the Tenant cross-examine the Landlords regarding the purpose for which the
N12 notices were delivered. Although the series of N12 notices would appear to
be excessive in that serving so many were probably not necessary, the evidence is insufficient to establish that these
notices were improperly served on the Tenant to harass her. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before March 10,
2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $892.41*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to February 27, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes
on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $43.26 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
February 28, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March 10, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from March
11, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 10, 2018, then starting March 11, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 11, 2018.
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust: 
i)        $2,806.60 if the payment is made on or before February 28, 2018, or
ii)       $4,122.40 if the payment is made on or before March 10, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March 11, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
