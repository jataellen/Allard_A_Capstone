Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-76039-16
 










 
 
 

Y.C. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict M.C. and J.L.M.
(the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on February 1 and March 17, 2017.
 
The
Landlord and the first-named Tenant above attended the hearing on February 1,
2017. The Tenant present was assisted with interpretation that day by B.L. and J.L..
On March 17, 2017, the Landlord attended the hearing but neither of the Tenants
appeared in person. The Landlord was represented throughout by L.L.. On March
17, 2017, the Tenants were represented by P.S..
 
Determinations:
 
1.      When
this matter initially came before the Board on February 1, 2017, it was readily
apparent that the Tenant who was present could not communicate in English so I
suggested she speak to Tenant Duty Counsel, which she did. When she returned to
the hearing room she was assisted by two friends who acted as interpreters. 
2.      Unfortunately,
the Board had insufficient time to complete the hearing on February 1, 2017 so
the matter was adjourned. I explained to the Tenant that I would be issuing an
interim order requiring payment into the Board of any new rent that came due
and owing, mutual disclosure, and that she would need to bring an interpreter
with her to the hearing. I was informed that she had been put in touch with a
legal clinic that could possibly provide legal and interpretation services.
That interim order was issued on February 2, 2017.
3.      When
the matter returned before me for hearing on March 17, 2017, neither of the
Tenants appeared. The Tenants’ representative asked me to stand the matter down
as the first-named Tenant was too ill to attend but the second-named Tenant was
on his way and the interpreter the clinic had arranged for was also delayed. After
more than an hour neither Tenant appeared at the hearing location. The Tenant’s
representative was unable to tell me why the second-named Tenant was not in
attendance as expected. 
4.      The
Tenant’s representative then asked for an adjournment which I denied. Clearly
the Tenants knew about the hearing and were represented. Even if it is true
that the first-named Tenant was too ill to attend on March 17, 2017, there is
no known reason why the second-named Tenant failed to appear. Further, the
Tenants failed to comply with the Board’s interim order with respect to payment
into the Board. The evidence supports the conclusion that instead of paying
rent into the Board on March 1, 2017, they paid the rent directly to the
Landlord on March 7, 2017. Given these factors, additional adjournment would be
unfair to the Landlord. An adjournment is not warranted and is denied
accordingly. After announcing this decision orally, I proceeded to hear the
application on its merits. 
5.      There
is no dispute that the Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required
to pay for the period from September 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017.  Because of the
arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective December 12,
2016.
6.      The
Tenants paid $630.00 after the application was filed.
7.      The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending March 31, 2017 total $3,780.00.
8.      The
Landlord incurred costs of $170.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
9.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). The
Landlord is unaware of any circumstances that would justify relief and the
Tenants’ representative declined to participate in the hearing on the merits on
the basis that she had no instructions to do so. As a result, I find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
the Act.
It is
ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before March 31, 2017.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $3,538.13*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to March 20, 2017.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $20.71 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting March 21, 2017 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $170.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March
31, 2017, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from April 1, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before March 31, 2017, then starting April 1,
2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 1, 2017.
8.      If,
on or before March 31, 2017, the Tenants pay the amount of $3,950.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after April 1, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
