Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-21455-19
 










 
 
 

C2LP(the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict MR (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on January 21, 2020.
 
The Landlord’s representative, KA, and the Tenant attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from September 1, 2019 to January 31, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 30, 2019.
 
2.      At
the hearing, the Tenant agreed with the Landlord’s evidence of the Tenant’s
rent arrears for the period ending January 31, 2020.
 
3.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,305.72 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
4.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from November 1, 2018
to September 30, 2019.
 
5.      The
Tenant paid $2,450.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.      The
Tenant requested relief from eviction at the hearing.  I find, however, that
the Tenant’s evidence of his household’s income shows that the monthly rent is
not affordable.  It is therefore appropriate to terminate the tenancy.
 
7.      The
Tenant has a part-time job and earns approximately $1,200.00 a month.  Although
the Tenant gave evidence of his belief that he will eventually be given full-time
hours, no evidence was adduced to determine the reliability or reasonableness
of the Tenant’s belief.  I therefore conclude that the Tenant’s evidence that
he will soon earn full-time employment income is not reliable.
 
8.      The
Tenant also receives approximately $400.00 from the CCTB, and up to $500.00 a
month from OW.  The OW benefits, however, are clawed back when the Tenant earns
employment income.
 
9.      Based
on the evidence adduced at the hearing, I find that the Tenant’s monthly income
is insufficient to afford the monthly rent of $1,335, 97 and other monthly
expenses.  Indeed, the Tenant has paid to the Landlord an amount equal to less
than two months’ rent since the application was filed in October 2019.
 
10.   I
therefore conclude that it is appropriate to terminate the tenancy.
 
11.   However,
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 29,
2020, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. 
The Landlord is holding a rent deposit from the Tenant, and it is therefore
appropriate to give the Tenant time to find new accommodations, or to arrange
to pay the arrears owing.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before February 29, 2020.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4,025.49*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to January 28, 2020, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $43.15 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting January 29, 2020 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
February 29, 2020, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from March 1, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 29, 2020, then starting March 1,
2020, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2020.
 
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $4,372.63 if the payment is made on or before January 31, 2020, or
ii)       $5,708.60 if the payment is made on or before February 29, 2020**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after March 1, 2020 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
