Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-92180-18
 
B.N and D.N
(the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict T.AM (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlords
also claimed NSF cheque charges and related administration charges.
 
The Landlords also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant has been persistently late
in paying the Tenant's rent. The Landlords also claimed compensation for each
day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
These applications were heard in Toronto on March 20,
2018.
 
One of the Landlords, B.N, and the
Tenant attended the hearing. 
The Landlords’ son, V.N (VN) testified
as the Landlords’ witness.
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.     
The parties are not in
dispute that the tenancy began on October 1, 2016 and the current rent is $1,520.00
per month.  The rental unit is a single house which the Tenant is occupying in
its entirety.
 
L1 – non-payment of rent
 
2.     
The Tenant does not dispute
that she has not paid the full rent to the Landlords for the month of January
2017, and any rent for February and March 2018. Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective January 17, 2018.
 
3.     
The Landlords collected a
rent deposit of $1,500.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still held by the
Landlords.
4.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from October 26, 2015 to January 17,
2018.
S. 82 issue
5.     
The Tenant explained that
she withheld the partial rent for January 2018 because the furnace broke down
that month and she incurred $350.00 in emergency repairs, for which she has not
been reimbursed.  The Tenant submitted an invoice for repairs for that amount
dated January 4, 2018. The invoice clearly spelt out that the work was done on
January 4 and 5, 2018 as a result of a call for no heat on January 4, 2018.
6.     
As the rent was due on
January 1, 2018 and this incident took place on January 4, 2018, I find no
logical nexus between the furnace breakdown and the Tenant’s failure to pay
rent three days prior.
7.     
The Tenant also testified
that she did not notify the Landlord at the time and chose to call for
emergency repairs herself because it was late at night.  She needed to get it
done right away and paid for the emergency repairs herself and notified the
Landlords afterwards.
8.     
The Landlords submitted an
invoice from the contractor they hired to repair the furnace showing that the
contractor attended the rental unit and effected repairs on the furnace on
January 7, 8, and 10, 2018, which cost a total of $1,783.61.
9.     
Certainly the loss of heat
in the middle of winter is a serious issue.  However, as stated by the Ontario
Court of Appeal in McQuestion v. Schneider (1975), 8. O.R. (2d) 249
(C.A.), and as explained in Guideline 5 of the LTB Interpretation Guidelines,
there is not a strict or absolute liability on the Landlords and the Landlords
cannot be held liable for problems which they were not made aware of.  
10.  
In this case, there is no
evidence of previous complaints or that this had been a persistent or
continuing problem which the Landlords should have been aware of.  The
Landlords have shown themselves to be responsible and diligent in addressing
the issue of furnace breakdown once they became aware of it.  It is simply not
reasonable on the part of the Tenant to withhold rent on that basis.  
11.  
I also do not find it
reasonable that the Tenant would not first attempt to notify the Landlords
before calling for repairs herself.  The invoice from the contractor used by
the Landlords indicate that it provides 24 hour same day emergency service.  It
is simply speculation on the Tenant’s part that the Landlords would not have
responded at that late hour. 
12.  
However, in light of the
emergency nature of the furnace breakdown in winter, the presence of young
children in the household, the late hours it occurred, it would not be
inappropriate to order the Landlords to reimburse the Tenant $350.00 for the
emergency repairs to get the furnace working that night.  The Tenant had
withheld this amount from her rent payment for January 2018, which will be
factored into my calculations.
L2 – persistent late payment of rent
13.  
In addition to her
non-payment of rent in January, February and March 2018, the Tenant also
provided NSF rent cheques to the Landlords in August 2016, and August, October
and December 2017.
14.  
The Landlords provided
evidence from the bank showing that the Tenant’s rent payment cheques for
August 1, 2016, August 1, 2017, October 1, 2017, December 1, 2017 and March 1,
2018 were returned for non-sufficient funds (NSF).  The Landlords incurred
charges of $75.00 for cheques tendered by the Tenant, which were returned NSF
and $100.00 for related administration charges.  The Tenant has not disputed
the Landlord’s evidence on this issue.
15.  
I find this constitutes
persistent late payment of rent by the Tenant.
16.  
The Landlords’ evidence is
that they have tried to meet with the Tenant to obtain rent only to find the
Tenant failing to show up for the appointment on multiple occasions, resulting
in significant loss of time for the Landlords. 
Section 83 Considerations
17.  
The Tenant testified that she
has some health issues, including cancer diagnosed in 2016, but has not
provided any medical evidence to substantiate that claim.  She also stated that
she is divorced and has two young children aged 8 and 12 who are living with
her, and that she would require two months to move out.  The Landlords
indicated they are amenable to that.
18.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.  However, I also find
that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until May 31, 2018, pursuant
to subsection 83(1) (b) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlords and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before May 31, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlords $1,533.70*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to March 26, 2018 and the total charges related to NSF cheques
tendered to the Landlords by or on behalf of the Tenant, less the rent deposit
and interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $49.97 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
March 27, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before May 31, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June 1, 2018
at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before May 31, 2018, then starting June 1, 2018, the Landlords may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlords, on or after June 1, 2018.
