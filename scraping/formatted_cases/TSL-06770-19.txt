Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-06770-19
 










 
 
 

I.P.V.L
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict N.K, J.M
and B.J (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on July 2, 2019.
 
The
Landlord’s representative, F.S, and the Tenant, B.J, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
The
Tenants owe $5,939.21
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the
period from May 1, 2019 to July 31, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective June 5, 2019.
 
2.      The
Tenant did not dispute that the Tenants owe the amount the Landlord is
claiming. Therefore, I am satisfied on balance of probabilities that the
Tenants owe the Landlord $5,939.21, including arrears of rent to July 31, 2019
and the application filing fee. 
 
3.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,931.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
4.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from February 14,
2019 to June 5, 2019.
 
 
Section
83 considerations
 
5.      The
Tenant requested conditional relief from eviction. Specifically, the Tenant
testified that he was prepared to pay the Landlord $900.00 cash as well as
$2,575.00, which he anticipates receiving from the Housing Stabilization Fund.
The Tenant testified that he was told by staff from the HSF that the fund would
make this payment provided that the Landlord consented to a payment plan to pay
off the balance owing. I note that the Tenant did not submit anything in
writing from the HSF to confirm that it is prepared to make any payment to the
Tenant or to the Landlord on the Tenant’s behalf. In any event, I am not
satisfied that a conditional order would be appropriate in this case because
the Tenants do not appear to be able to afford any monthly payments toward the
arrears, let alone the rent. 
 
6.      The
Tenant testified that his monthly household income totals $3,430.00, including
$2,300.00 from the Ontario Disability Support Program, $600.00 from his wife’s
income as a lunchroom monitor (during the school-year only) and $530.00 as a
child tax credit.  The Tenant testified that his monthly expenses total
$3,670.00, including rent ($1,931), utilities ($440), transportation ($270),
insurance ($29), food and clothing ($1,000). Based on the Tenant’s testimony,
the Tenants’ expenses exceed their income. The Tenants cannot afford the rent
and they do not have any money left over to make payments toward the arrears. 
 
7.      The
Tenant testified that he recently applied for other subsidies from the City’s
EPIC program and Peel Housing Support Program, but he did not submit any
evidence to confirm that his applications will be granted and/or how much he
will receive from these sources. Similarly, the Tenant testified that he has
received financial assistance from family, but he did not submit any evidence
to confirm that his family is prepared to provide him money for his
rent/arrears going forward. 
 
8.      The
Landlord requested a “standard order”, requiring the Tenants to pay the total
amount owing within 11 days, failing which the Landlord can enforce eviction.
When I asked the Tenant how long he would need to move out if the application
was granted, the Tenant replied he would need 60 days to save first and last
months’ rent for a new apartment. In the circumstances, I find it appropriate
to order a standard order with an extended termination date of July 31, 2019.
The extension will give the Tenants time to find out the outcome of their
recent subsidy applications and explore other sources for paying the arrears. I
am reluctant to extend the termination date any further because this is a
relatively new tenancy (the Tenant testified that the Tenants have been living
in the rental unit for 4-5 months) and substantial arrears have accumulated in
a short period. The Landlord is holding a last month’s rent deposit, so this
extension should not prejudice the Landlord. 
 
9.      Accordingly, I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction
until July 31, 2019 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before July 31, 2019.
 
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $2,372.81*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to July 8, 2019, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $63.48 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting July 9, 2019 to the date the Tenants move out of the
unit.
 
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before July
31, 2019, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from August 1, 2019 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before July 31, 2019, then starting August 1,
2019, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after August 1, 2019.
 
8.      If,
on or before July 31, 2019, the Tenants pay the amount of $5,939.21** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after August 1, 2019 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
