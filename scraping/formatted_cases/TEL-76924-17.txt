Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-76924-17
 











 
 

Landlord’s L1
G.G. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict R.O. and J.P. (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
Landlord’s L2
G.G. (the 'Landlord') also applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict R.O. and J.P. (the 'Tenants') because they or
another occupant of the rental unit have committed an illegal act or have
carried out, or permitted someone to carry out an illegal trade, business or
occupation in the rental unit or the residential complex; and because they have
been persistently late in paying their rent. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
These applications were heard in Whitby on February 6,
2017.
 
Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
With respect to the
Landlord’s L1 application, the
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from November 1, 2016 to February 28, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective January 13, 2017.
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,600.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from April 2, 2016 to January 13, 2017.
4.     
With respect to the
Landlord’s L2 application, this
part of the application dealt with rent being paid in a persistently late
manner and that the Tenant was carrying out illegal acts in the rental unit.
5.     
In both cases the Landlord
was unable to provide sufficient evidence that would show on the balance of
probabilities that any of these were occurring.
6.     
In a case such as this the
burden of proof falls upon the person bring the accusations. In this case the
Landlord did not meet that burden and this portion of the application was
dismissed.
7.     
As the Landlord provided a
copy of a text from the Tenants showing that they intend to vacate the unit on
March 1, 2017 and also that I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until March 1, 2017 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of
the Act.
8.     
The Reasons contained in
this order constitute all of the reasons used in making my decision.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before March 1,
2017.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $2,779.96*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to February 7, 2017, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $52.60 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting February 8, 2017 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March 1, 2017, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from March
2, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 1, 2017, then starting March 2, 2017, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 2, 2017.
8.     
If the Tenants wish to void this
order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust:
i)        $5,790.00 if the payment is made on or before February 28, 2017, or
ii)       $7,390.00 if the payment is made on or before March 1, 2017**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March 2, 2017
but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
