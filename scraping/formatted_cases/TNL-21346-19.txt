Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-21346-19
 











 
 
 

DG (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict KP and LC (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay
the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Newmarket on January 20,
2020.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s legal
representative, FG, and the Tenant, LC, attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September
1, 2019 to January 31, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a
Notice of Termination effective.
 
2.     
The Landlord collected a rent
deposit of $2,025.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by
the Landlord.
 
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from May 25, 2018 to January 31, 2020.
 
4.      The Tenants have been living in the rental unit,
a condominium apartment, for about 2 ½ years.
 
5.      The Tenant, (LC), said that she and her partner
run a vape shop that has suffered a large decline in income since the summer of
2019.  She said that she expects a large boost in business income when new
regulations, that are imminent, come into effect.
 
6.      LC also said that she is currently looking for
supplementary work in the airline industry.
 
7.      LC was unable to provide any documents to
support the stated income or expenses of the business.  LC failed to give consistent
testimony about her and her partner’s personal income or expenses.
 
8.      LC is seeking a payment plan.  She said that the
Tenants can pay $400.00 per week towards the arrears, as well as the full rent
on time, going forward.
 
9.      The Landlord said that he is the sole owner of
the rental unit.  He said that he has a mortgage and a number of expenses on
the property, including taxes and condo fees, every month.  He said that he is
dependent upon the rent income to pay the monthly fixed expenses on the condo.
 
10.   The Landlord also said that he has undergone
open heart surgery recently, and that he has been unable to work in his own
profession.  He said that he is suffering a severe financial burden, and
prejudice, because he is not receiving the rent income.
 
11.   The Landlord’s legal representative said that
the Landlord is seeking an expedited termination order because the Landlord is
suffering severe prejudice by continuing the tenancy.  He submits that the
Landlord has agreed to payment arrangements with the Tenants in the past, and
they have failed to comply.
 
12.   I find that the Tenants have not provided any
documentary evidence to support their ability to meet their proposed payment
plan.  The testimony provided by LC about the Tenants’ monthly income and
expenses was vague, inconsistent, and contradictory.  The Tenants have made
only small, erratic payments towards the rent since September, 2019. 
Consequently, I find that the Tenants have not proved, on a balance of
probabilities, that they would be able to meet the terms of their proposed
payment plan.
 
13.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.  The Tenants owe
a substantial amount of arrears, and there is no credible evidence to support
their stated ability to pay the arrears, or the full rent, going forward.  I
find that continuing the tenancy is prejudicial to the Landlord, and that the
tenancy is no longer viable.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenants void the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before February
22, 2020.
 
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $6,420.75*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to February 11, 2020, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes
on the rent deposit.
 
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $66.58 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting February 12, 2020 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 22, 2020, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
February 23, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 22, 2020, then starting February 23, 2020, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 23, 2020.
 
8.     
If, on or before February
22, 2020, the Tenants pay the amount of $9,975.00** to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after February 23,
2020 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
