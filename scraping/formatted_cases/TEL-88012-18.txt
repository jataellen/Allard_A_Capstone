R.U.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict H.S.
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.  This
is an L1 application.
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the
Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after
the termination date.  This is an L2 application.
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant entered into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.  This
is an L3 application.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on April 3, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
APPLICATION
FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.     The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from January 1, 2018 to April 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective January 17, 2018.
2.     I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
APPLICATION
FOR SUBSTANTIAL INTEFERENCE, DAMAGE AND OVERCROWDING
3.     The
Landlord served the Tenant with three Notices of Termination (‘Form N5’) under
sections 62, 64 and 67 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’).  All three Form N5s are fatally flawed as outlined below.
4.     A
Form N5 essentially sets out all three notices under the sections noted in
paragraph 3 on the same form.  Each ‘reason’ as listed in the Form N5
corresponds with a section of the Act.  Reason 1 relates to section 64 issues,
reason 2 is section 62, and reason 3 is section 67.  With each reason there are
two choices which are to indicate whether it is the first or second notice
under that applicable section.
5.     In
this case, all three Form N5s the Landlord served on the Tenant set out the following
notices:
a)    Second
notice under section 64;
b)    First
and second notice under section 62; and
c)    Second
notice under section 67.  
6.     None
of the Form N5s gave the Tenant an opportunity to first remedy the situation in
seven days.  For this reason, I find no first notice of termination has been
given; therefore, a second notice cannot be served.  
7.     The
Landlord’s Form N5s are all deemed invalid.
AGREEMENT
TO TERMINATE THE TENANCY
8.     The
Landlord and the Tenant entered into an agreement to terminate the tenancy at
the time of entering into the tenancy agreement.
9.     Subsection
37(5) of the Act states, 
An
agreement between a landlord and tenant to terminate a tenancy is void if it is
entered into,
     (a)
at the time the tenancy agreement is entered into; or
     (b)
as a condition of entering into the tenancy agreement
10.  The
Landlord submitted another piece of paper which simply has a rental period
listed.
11.  Based on
subsection 37(5) and the letter lacking in pertinent information, there is no
agreement to terminate the tenancy; therefore, this claim must be dismissed. 
DAMAGE
CLAIM UNDER SECTION 89
12.  The
Landlord’s application claims damages to a carpet in the amount of $100.00;
however, provided no evidence of the damaged.
13.  When
asked, the Landlord stated that the carpet is dirty.  This is not damage.  As a
result, the Landlord’s claim is dismissed.
14.  This
order contains all of the reasons for my decision within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.  
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before April 20, 2018.
2.     The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,789.96*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to April 9, 2018.
3.     The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $18.08 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting April 10, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.     The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.     If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before April
20, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from April 21, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 20, 2018, then starting April 21,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 21, 2018.
8.     If,
on or before April 20, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $2,390.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.     The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after April 21, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
