Order under Section
21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-09111-18-RV
 
 
 
Review Order
 
GMD
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict RAM
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges.
 
This
application was resolved by order TNL-09111-18 issued on November 14, 2018.
 
On November 23, 2018, the Tenant
requested a review of the order.
 
A preliminary review of the review request was completed without a
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      On
the basis of the submissions made in the request, I am not satisfied that there
is a serious error in the order or that a serious error occurred in the
proceedings.
 
2.      The
Tenant contends that there is a material error in the arrears ordered because
the Landlord illegally increased the rent. Rule
29.7 of the Landlord and Tenant Board Rules of Practice provides that a
request to review must be complete and include a detailed description of the
alleged error and the requestor’s position on how the order should be changed
if the request to review is successful.  The Tenant failed to provide
sufficient detail or supporting documentation with respect to this issue to
justify sending it to a hearing.
 
3.      The
Tenant alleges that he did not have a reasonable opportunity to participate in
the original hearing because he did not receive the Notice of Hearing until
November 8, 2018, a day after the hearing.
 
4.       I
find that the Tenant had a reasonable opportunity to participate, but did not
exercise due diligence in checking his mail or chose not to attend the hearing
(Q Res IV Operating GP Inc. v. Berezovs’ka, 2017 ONSC 5541 CanLII
(Div. Ct.)) (“Berezovs’ka”).  Under the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
(the 'Act') a mailed document is deemed to be
received 5 days later. The Board mailed the Notice of Hearing and the
application to the Tenant on October 10, 2018, and the Landlord’s application
was heard on November 7, 2018. The Notice of Hearing was not returned to the
Board and the postal disruption is unlikely to have delayed the delivery for
the Notice of Hearing by almost a month. 
 
5.      In
Berezovs’ka, at para. 8, the Court noted that::
 
If parties are not
diligent in dealing with legal proceedings then they cannot demand that a
Tribunal waste its resources by rehearing matters a second time.  To allow
this would undermine the ability of the administration of justice to deliver
timely, cost-effective and final orders.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
request to review order TNL-09111-18 issued on November 14, 2018, is denied. The order is confirmed and remains unchanged.
