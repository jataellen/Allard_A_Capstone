Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-07365-19
 











 
 
 

T.  LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict P. G. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on February 5,
2020.
 
The Landlord’s representative,
David Rubin, and the Tenant’s representative, W. P. attended the hearing.
 
As a result
of a Superior Court of Justice order suspending the enforcement of LTB eviction
orders during the period from March 19, 2020 to July 31, 2020, the issuance of
this Order has been delayed. Any payments made by the Tenant(s) to the Landlord
after the application was filed by the Landlord must deducted from the amount
ordered by the Board. 
 
Determinations:
THE
ADJOURNMENT REQUEST
1.     
At the beginning of the
hearing the Tenant asked for an adjournment. His representative says he is too
sick to attend the hearing today. He is scared he may have the coronavirus. And
he has new evidence he wishes to present. For the reasons that follow, the
Tenant’s adjournment request is denied.
2.     
With respect to the
allegation the Tenant is too sick to attend today, the Tenant’s representative
showed me on his phone a letter purporting to be from the Tenant’s doctor
written the day of the hearing. It says the patient was seen for medical
reasons today; please excuse his absence from work or school starting yesterday;
and he may return to work starting tomorrow. 
3.     
With respect to this note
from the doctor I would observe that it is clear that the Tenant does not have
the coronavirus and his physician does not believe that is a possibility. If
the doctor considered that to be a possibility he clearly would not have said
the Tenant can attend work or school tomorrow; I take judicial notice that the
Tenant would have been quarantined for 14 days.
4.     
I would also observe that
the Tenant was well enough to retain his representative last night and go to
the clinic to see a doctor today.
5.     
With respect to the “new”
evidence the Tenant’s representative refers to, he cannot say what new evidence
he is talking about. 
6.     
The Landlord objects to the
adjournment being granted. The Landlord states that in the six month period
prior to the hearing the Tenant has made only one payment of $1,000.00 to the
Landlord for rent which was made prior to the application being filed. The
arrears stand at $7,159.40 as of the date of hearing for the period ending
February 29, 2020. The Tenant has not contacted the Landlord about the debt or
these proceedings. The Tenant’s representative did not contact the Landlord
prior to the hearing to seek consent to rescheduling. 
7.     
The Landlord also argues
that the delays at the Landlord and Tenant Board mean that the prejudice to the
Landlord of any adjournment is substantial. This application was filed on
December 6, 2019 and the hearing was scheduled for two months later. Based on
the Tenant’s non-payment of rent leading up to the hearing of this application,
that means that any adjournment is more likely than not to result in at least
another two month’s rent going into arrears.  
8.     
During the course of the
parties’ submissions with respect to this adjournment request the Tenant’s
representative stated he understood there is a problem with lack of funds. 
9.     
Given all of the above, the
adjournment is denied. It seems to me more likely than not that the adjournment
is a panicked response to the Tenant not being able to pay the rent and facing eviction.

10.  
The note from the doctor
does not establish the Tenant is so ill he cannot participate in the hearing.
He is well enough to attend the clinic and retain a representative. I would
also observe no request was made for the Tenant to participate by telephone, an
option that his legal representative knew or ought to have known was available.
There is no “new” evidence the Tenant’s representative actually knows about and
the Tenant is not precluded from filing his own application and seeking set off
if that is relevant. The prejudice to the Landlord of the delay is substantial,
and pursuant to s. 74 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’)
the Board is mandatorily required to give the Tenant opportunities in its order
to pay the rent arrears and continue the tenancy. 
11.  
As a result, I find that the
prejudice to the Landlord of the adjournment outweighs the prejudice to the
Tenant. Granting an adjournment in these circumstances would not be reasonable.
The request is denied. 
12.  
After making this decision
in the hearing room I proceeded to hear the application but also invited the
Tenant’s representative to participate fully despite the fact he appears to
have no instructions as to what to say or do if the adjournment is denied.  
13.  
I would also note that after
reading the medical note into the record I instructed the Tenant’s
representative to immediately print out the notice, file a copy with the Board
the same day and give a copy to the Landlord.  I did this because Rule 19.3 of
the Board’s Rules of Procedure says:
The LTB may permit a party to refer to electronic material
(audio or video recordings, emails, text messages, social media posts) in the
hearing if relevant to the issues in dispute and the Member is satisfied it is
reliable. A party is expected to provide a copy to the other party and to the
LTB at the hearing but where this is not possible due to the document's format
or size, the Member will require the party to file a copy with the LTB by a
specified date. If the copy is not filed as directed, the electronic
material will not be considered part of the hearing record or considered when
making the decision.
[Emphasis added.]
14.  
The Board’s records show
that the Tenant’s representative failed to file the doctor’s note with the
Board as directed. Nonetheless, given that the decision above denying the
adjournment was announced in the hearing room, I am prepared to waive the
application of Rule 19.3 and have included in these reasons the note as read
into the record at the hearing. 
THE
LANDLORD’S APPLICATION
15.  
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from September 1, 2019
to February 29, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective December 4, 2019.
16.  
The lawful monthly rent
increased effective January 1, 2020 by the guideline amount to $1,379.70 which
includes parking. 
17.  
The Tenant made no payments
to the Landlord after the application was filed. 
18.  
The arrears of rent owing
for the period ending February 29, 2020 as of the date of hearing total
$7,159.40.
19.  
The Landlord incurred costs
of $175.00 for filing the application and is entitled to reimbursement of those
costs.
20.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act and find
that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 20, 2020,
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. I say this because the Tenant’s
representative says that he although the Tenant is not currently working, he believes
the Tenant can make a payment now of $1,500.00 to the Landlord and is arranging
to borrow funds from family. He has an uncle, for example, who may be willing
to advance him $2,000.00 to $3,000.00 in the next two weeks. The Landlord is
unaware of any circumstances that would warrant relief from eviction.
21.  
Finally, the Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,325.31 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord. If the tenancy ends as a result of this order, this
amount shall be offset against the rent arrears owing. 
22.  
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2019 to December 4, 2019
totalling $22.11. Again, if the tenancy ends as a result of this order, this
amount shall also be offset against the rent arrears owing.
23.  
This order contains all of
the reasons for the decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.
It is ordered that:
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before August
15, 2020.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $12,891.92* (less any payment made by the Tenant after the hearing
before the Board), which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to August 4, 2020, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $45.36 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
August 5, 2020 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before August 15, 2020, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
August 16, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before August 15, 2020, then starting August 16, 2020, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after August 16, 2020.
8.     
The Tenant may void this
order if, on or before February 20, 2020, the Tenant pays $7,334.40** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust.  This means that the tenancy would not be
terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this payment is not
made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after August 16, 2020 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
10.  
Any payments made by the
Tenant to the Landlord after the hearing held on February 3, 2020, shall be
deducted from the total amount owing under this order.
