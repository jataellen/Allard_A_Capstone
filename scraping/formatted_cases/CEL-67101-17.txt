Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-67101-17
FM and AR (the
'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict AHl (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes; and
because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlords in
a residential complex that has three or fewer residential units. The Landlords
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after
the termination date.
 
This
application was heard in Barrie on June 16, 2017.
 
The Landlords and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
At the hearing, the Tenant raised issues under section 82 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').
 
 Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from April 1, 2017 to June 30, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective May 22, 2017.
 
2.      Although
the Tenant disagreed with the amount of rent arrears the Landlords claimed at
the hearing, the Tenant did agree with the Landlord’s evidence that the Tenant
did not pay the full rent she was required to pay in April 2017, and that the
Tenant paid no rent in May 2017 and June 2017.  I therefore accept the
Landlords’ evidence of the amount the Tenant owes for the period ending June
30, 2017.
 
3.      Although
the Landlords did not prove that the Tenant smokes cigarettes inside the rental
unit, the Tenant did agree that she smokes cigarettes on a small patio directly
beside the residential complex.  Second hand smoke easily enters the
residential complex from this location, and substantially interferes with the
Landlords’ reasonable enjoyment of the upper floors of the property.
 
4.      There
was no evidence adduced at the hearing that the Tenant consumes marijuana in
the rental unit.
 
5.      The
Landlords did not dispute the Tenant’s evidence that the Tenant withheld rent
because the Landlords did not provide rent receipts.  The Landlords shall be
ordered to issue rent receipts when requested to do so.
 
6.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it would not be unfair to grant
relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. 

 
7.      Although
the Tenant requested two months to pay the amount that she owes to the
Landlord, I find that it is reasonable to postpone the eviction date to only
July 31, 2017.  It is appropriate to postpone the eviction date because of the
Landlords’ failure to provide the Tenant with rent receipts.  However, I also
find that it is not appropriate to postpone the eviction date beyond July 31,
2017, because the Tenant elected to spend the rent money she withheld from the
Landlords on other items.  Under the circumstances, it would be unfair to the
Landlords to postpone the eviction date beyond July 31, 2017, as doing so could
result in the accrual of additional rent arrears.
 
8.      The
Tenant shall be ordered to smoke cigarettes away from the residential complex,
to prevent any second hand smoke from entering the property.
It is ordered that:
 
The Application for Non-payment of Rent
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before July 31, 2017.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $1,415.03*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to June 19, 2017.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $26.30 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting June 20, 2017 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before July
31, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from August 1, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before July 31, 2017, then starting August 1,
2017, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after August 1,
2017.
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, subject to
paragraphs 10 and 11, below, the Tenant must pay to the Landlords or to the
Board in trust:
i)        $1,890.00 if the payment is made on or before June 30, 2017, or
ii)       $2,690.00 if the payment is made on or before July 31, 2017**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after August 1, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlords. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
The
Application for Substantial Interference
10.   The
Tenant, her guests and other occupants of the rental unit shall not permit
second hand cigarette smoke to enter the residential complex.
 
11.   If
the Tenant fails to comply with paragraph 10, above, the Landlord may apply
under section 78 of the Act, within 30 days of the breach, without notice to
the Tenant, for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant.
 
The
Tenant’s Section 82 Issues
12.   The
Landlords shall provide rent receipts upon request.
