REASONS
 
Reasons
to Order CEL-66306-17, issued on July 10, 2017, by Tiisetso Russell
 
 
The
Landlords applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (L1 application).
 
The
Landlords also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's
rent (L2 application).
 
The
application was resolved by order CEL-660306-17, issued on July 10, 2017.
 
On August 2, 2017 I received a request for reasons from the
Tenant.
 
Order CEL-660306-17, issued on July 10, 2017, contains all of the
reasons for the determinations made in the order with the exception of the
determination made in paragraph 11 of the order.
 
The following are the reasons for the determination made in paragraph
11 of the order:
 
I prefer the Landlord’s evidence regarding whether or not the
leaking tap was fixed because of the detail provided by the Landlord. 
 
The Landlord stated that, when he went to see the Tenant in
January 2017 to follow up on the rent that had not been paid, the Tenant told
him about the leaking tap. 
 
The Tenant testified that the turning spout was loose and the
Landlord stated that there was a little screw that he had to fix and he fixed
it when he was there. 
 
I find on a balance of probabilities that the description the
Landlord gave of how he fixed the tap is consistent with the Tenant’s
description of the problem with the tap.
