Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
 
File Number: HOL-06092-19
 



 


 


 



 
 
WC (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict ZT and YW (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay
the rent that the Tenants owe. The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges and
related administration charges.
 
This application was heard in Newmarket on January 22,
2020.
 
Only the Landlord's Representative,
BR attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from July 8,
2019 to February 7, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice
of Termination.
 
2.     
The Tenant is in possession
of the rental unit. 
 
3.     
The monthly rent as of the
date of the hearing is $2,500.00.
 
4.     
The Landlord incurred
charges of $10.00 for cheques tendered by or on behalf of the Tenants, which
were returned NSF and $60.00 for related administration charges.
 
5.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $2,400.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
 
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from October 14, 2016 to January 29, 2020.
 
7.     
The Tenants paid $2,500.00
after the application was filed.
 
 
 
8.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before February
9, 2020.
 
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $11,842.88*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 29, 2020 and the total charges related to NSF
cheques tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenants, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $82.19 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting January 30, 2020 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 9, 2020, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
February 10, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 9, 2020, then starting February 10, 2020, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 10, 2020.
 
8.     
If the Tenants wish to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $15,245.00 if the payment is made on or before February 7, 2020, or
ii)       $17,745.00 if the payment is made on or before February 9, 2020**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
 
 
 
 
 
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after February 10,
2020 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
