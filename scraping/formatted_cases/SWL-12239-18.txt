Order
under Sections 69 and 89
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: SWL-12239-18
 











 
 

GM (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict PN and MR (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe (the ‘L1 Application’).
 
The Landlord also applied for an order
requiring the Tenants to pay compensation for the damages caused by them or a
person they permitted in the residential complex (the ‘L2 Application’).
 
These applications were heard in Stratford
on February 9, 2018.  Only the Landlord’s Legal
Representative, KM, and the witness, JP, attended the hearing.  As of 10:30
a.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board. 
 
Determinations and
Reasons:
The L1 Application
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent they
were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2017 to February 28,
2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
December 27, 2017 (the ‘N4 Notice’).  While a single digit in the rental
schedule attached to this notice was missing, the mathematical context of
schedule clearly indicates that the missing number was a 9, indicating the
month of September.  As the rental schedule as a whole clearly sets out the
amount owing to the Landlord and the amount that the Tenants would have had to
pay to void the notice, on the balance of probabilities, I do not find that
this minor clerical error renders the notice defective.
2.     JP, the Landlord’s maintenance worker testified
that the Tenants were no longer actively residing in the rental unit when he
entered the residence approximately two weeks prior to the present hearing. 
However, in addition to substantial garbage and spoiled food, the Tenants left
numerous belongings in the unit, as well as the majority of their major items
of furniture, as confirmed by photographs taken by JP and submitted at the
hearing.  The Tenants have also retained the key to the rental unit.
3.     
Paragraph (b) of subsection 87(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) permits a
landlord to apply for an order for the payment of arrears of rent if the tenant
is in possession of the rental unit.  The effect of this section is that if the
tenant is not in possession of the rental unit on the date the application is
filed, the Landlord and Tenant Board (the ‘Board’) does not have jurisdiction
to issue an order requiring the tenant to pay the arrears of rent.  This is consistent with the decision of the Ontario Court
of Appeal in 1162994 Ontario Inc. v. Bakker et al., based on the
previous, but identical legislation.[1]
 
4.     
In Bakker, the Court
of Appeal held that “possession of a rental unit refers
to some form of control over that unit as demonstrated by factors such as
access to, use of, or occupation of the unit.”  The Court noted an earlier
decision in which tenants who had permanently vacated a rental unit when an
application was commenced were not considered “in possession” even though they
had not given notice of their intent to vacate and had kept the keys to the
unit.  The Court indicated that the Tribunal (now the Board) will have to
decide, based on the evidence, whether there is a sufficient connection between
the rental unit and the tenant to permit a finding that the tenant was “in
possession” of that rental unit.  The Court found that the tenant in Bakker
had “unequivocally, completely, and permanently vacated the unit” before the
application was filed and was therefore not a “tenant in possession.”
 
5.     I find that an entirely different situation was
apparent on the facts of this case.  Not only did the Tenants retain the keys
to the rental unit, they also kept numerous and significant items of their
personal property in the rental unit for possible future retrieval.  There was
also no indication that the Tenants ever provided any notice of termination to
the Landlord or indicated when or if they planned to vacate the rental unit in
compliance with the Landlord’s N4 Notice or otherwise.  As a result, I find
that the Tenants have retained control over the unit and were therefore still in
possession of the rental unit as of the date of the hearing.  
6.     The monthly rent is $999.06, effective November
1, 2017.
7.     The Tenants have made no payments since the
application was filed.  
8.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $965.00
from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
9.     Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenants for the period from September 12, 2015 to December 27, 2017.
10.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act and find that it would be unfair to
grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
The L2 Application 
11.   As noted above, JP first entered the rental unit
approximately two weeks prior to the hearing.  He repeatedly attempted to put
into the words a sense of the powerful and offensive odour that assailed his
senses upon entering the residence.  He observed that a substantial amount of
food left in the refrigerator had spoiled, damaging the appliance beyond any
reasonable ability to salvage.  He also noted the presence of feces in the
corners of the living areas and assumed these to have been deposited by unseen
pets.
 
 
12.   During his inspection of the rental unit, JP
noted the following damage:
a.    Someone had poured an unknown substance on the
kitchen floor, irreparably staining its surface.
b.    The flooring throughout the rental unit was
severely stained and damaged and requires replacement.  This includes both the
laminate and carpeted areas, the latter of which was severely stained by animal
urine.  At the hearing, the Landlord’s Legal Representative submitted a quote
from The Carpet Place for $3,829.57 to supply and install new carpeting
throughout the unit.
c.    The seals on the patio door had been destroyed. 
As the door was a one-piece item, the entire door requires replacement.
d.    As noted above, the refrigerator and chest
freezer will need to be replaced due to excessively foul-smelling decomposition
of abandoned food.  As the Tenants had allowed the hydro service to be
disconnected, there was no power to these appliances.  As well, one of the refrigerator
drawers was missing.
e.    An interior door had been forcibly removed and
left outside the rental unit.
f.     
The walls were severely
stained with smoke, mould and other contaminants, requiring repainting
throughout the rental unit.  JP estimated the cost of supplies and labour for
this item to total $860.00.
g.    The Tenants left a substantial amount of
property in the rental unit, including furniture and bicycles.  As well, JP
testified that the Landlord will need to rent a disposal bin to remove the
damaged carpet as well debris left by the Tenants.  
h.    The window blinds in the basement were damaged
beyond repair.
i.     
There was considerable
garbage and debris left outside the house.
13.   I find that the Tenants, an occupant of the
rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the Tenants have wilfully and negligently caused undue damage to
the rental unit and the residential complex.
14.   While the Landlord included several items such
as unpaid utilities and other fees that do not relate to damage or cleaning the
residence, as the cost of carpet replacement exceeded the estimate in the L2
Application, the ultimate total compensation ordered shall remain unchanged.
15.   The Landlord will incur costs of $8,291.00 to
repair the damage and replace property that was damaged and cannot be
reasonably repaired.
16.  This order contains all of the reasons in this matter and
no further reasons will issue.
 
It is ordered that:
 
The L1 Application
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out
below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The
Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before February 23, 2018.
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$4,396.75*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to
February 12, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$32.85 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 13,
2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before February 23, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe
interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from February 24, 2018 at
3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February
23, 2018, then starting February 24, 2018, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
7.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord, on or after February 24, 2018.
8.     If, on or before February 23, 2018, the Tenants
pay the amount of $6,156.24** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this
order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy would not be
terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If this payment is not
made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after February 24, 2018, but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.  The Tenants are only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
The L2 Application
10.  The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $8,291.00, which represents
the reasonable costs of repairing the damage and replacing the damaged
property.
 
11.  If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February 23, 2018, they will start to owe interest.  This
will be simple interest calculated from February 24, 2018 at 3.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
