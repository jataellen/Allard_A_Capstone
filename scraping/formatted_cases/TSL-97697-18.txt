Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-97697-18










 

L.P.A.L
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict M.L.J
and T.K (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe. (L1 application)
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evicting the
Tenants because the Tenants have been persistently late in paying their rent.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the
unit after the termination date. (L2 application)
 
This
combined L1/L2 application was heard in Toronto on November 27, 2018.
 
The
Landlord’s legal representative, H.L, the Landlord’s site manager, D.M, and the
Tenant, T. K (TK), attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
            Preliminary Issue – Tenants’ Late Disclosure
 
1.      The
parties previously appeared before the Board on September 13, 2018.  The matter
was adjourned at the time, in part due to lack of disclosure of a s. 82 issue
raised by the Tenants at the hearing.  An interim order dated September 14,
2018 (TSL-97697-18-IN) was issued directing the parties to provide disclosure
of evidence to each other.  The Tenants were ordered to disclose to the
Landlord their evidence no later than 15 days before the next hearing date, and
the Landlord to disclose to the Tenants the Landlord’s evidence no later than
10 days before the next hearing date.
2.      At
the hearing, the Landlord’s legal representative indicated that the Tenants
were late by six days in their disclosure and requested that the Tenants’
disclosed evidence be barred from being used at this hearing.
3.      The
Tenant TK agreed that the Tenants were late by six days in their disclosure,
and explained that the disclosure was late because she was sick and her dog was
sick.
4.      I
do not find the Tenants’ excuse reasonable or sufficient.  The interim order
was issued on September 14, 2018, and the required day of disclosure was 15
days before this hearing, or November 12, 2018.  This means that the Tenants
had nearly two months to prepare and disclose their evidence.  The Tenant TK
also has not submitted any evidence to support her claim that she or her dog
was sick in that period.  The disclosure was late by 6 days which diminished
the time available for the Landlord to prepare its case.
5.      I
find the Tenants failed to comply with the disclosure ordered in the interim
order. As stated in paragraph 8 of the interim order, “Pursuant to Rule 19.1(3)
of the Board’s Rules of Practice a party that does not comply with an order for
disclosure may not be permitted to rely on any evidence not properly
disclosed.”
6.      Accordingly,
the Tenants cannot rely on the evidence they failed to disclose in accordance
with the interim order TSL-97697-18-IN.
            L1
application
7.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the
period from July 1, 2018 to November 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 20, 2018.
8.      The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
9.      The monthly rent as of the date of the hearing is $1,327.74.
10.   The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,327.74 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
11.   Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from June 1, 2018 to
July 20, 2018.
12.   The
Tenants paid $6,250.00 after the application was filed. 
13.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
L2
application
14.   On July 12,
2018, the Landlord served the Tenant a Notice to Terminate at End of the Term
for persistent late payment of rent (the ‘N8 notice’) with a termination date
of September 30, 2018. 
15.   I find
that the N8 notice is in compliance with the Act. It meets the 60 day
requirement and provides sufficient details as of the reason for the notice.
16.   The N8
notice alleged that the rent is due on the first day of each month and the Tenants
have been late in paying rent in every month since September 1, 2016, which
necessitated the Landlord serving N4 notices and filing applications at the
Board on numerous occasions in order for the Tenant to pay the arrears.
17.   Based on
the evidence of the Landlord, including the detailed records and numerous N4
notices served on the Tenants, I am satisfied that, on a balance of
probabilities, the Tenants have been persistently late in paying rent.
18.   The Tenant
TK does not dispute the allegations of persistent late payment of rent but explains
that the Tenants did so because of mice infestation of the unit.
19.   There is
no evidence of the Tenants having filed a T6 application for maintenance issue
before the Board, and according to the Tenant TK, the Tenants only started
complaining to the Landlord about this issue since June 2018, while they have
been persistently late in paying rent since September 2016.  The Tenant TK also
acknowledged that the Landlord has responded to the mice complaint although the
Tenants are still not completely satisfied with the result.
20.   Based on
the Tenant TK’s testimony and the Landlord’s site manager’s evidence, I am
satisfied that the Landlord responded to the Tenants’ request by calling in a
pest control company which treated the unit about 1.5 weeks after receiving a
written complaint from the Tenant, with subsequent treatments that followed.
21.   The
Ontario Court of Appeal had stated in Onyskiw v. CJM Property Management
Ltd., 2016 ONCA 477, that the Landlord is not automatically in breach of
its maintenance obligations under section 20 of the Act simply because there
are maintenance issues with the rental unit.  Rather, the reasonableness of the
Landlord’s response to those issues, once made aware, should be considered when
determining whether the Landlord is in breach of its maintenance obligations.
22.   The
evidence overall indicates that the Landlord acted promptly, reasonably and
diligently in response to the Tenants’ request. As such, I find the Tenants
have failed to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the Landlord has
not met its obligations under subsection 20(1) of the Act to repair or maintain
the rental unit and to comply with maintenance standards.
23.   The
evidence is also clear that the Tenants only raised this concern to the
Landlord in June 2018 while they have been persistently late in paying their
rent since September 2016.
24.   In any
case, while the Tenants can raise maintenance issues with regards to an L1
application based on non-payment of rent, this cannot be raised with respect to
an L2 application based on persistent late payment of rent.
            S. 83
Considerations
25.   The only
hardship the Tenant TK raised is that it is not easy to find a new place to
move to, as rent has gone up.  There is no evidence of any effort of finding a
new place, or what the rent differential of a comparable unit is. 
26.   I have
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including the
delay in the issuance of this order, and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. Because of the
persistent late payment, the tenancy will terminate even if the Tenants pay the
full amount currently owing under the L1 application.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before January 29, 2019.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $1,236.28*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to January 18, 2019, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $43.65 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting January 19, 2019 to the date the Tenants move out of
the unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January
29, 2019, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from January 30, 2019 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before January 29, 2019, then starting January
30, 2019, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 30,
2019.
