Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-67620-17
 










 



 


 



 
 

A
K (‘AK’ or the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict W B (‘WB’ or the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that
the Tenant owes. (L1 Application)
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because:   the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered
with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlord or another tenant;  the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or
someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or
negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage. (L2
Application with N5 notice of termination)  Also in the application, the
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because they have been persistently late in paying their rent. The
Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the
unit after the termination date. (L2 Application with N8 notice of termination)
 
These
applications were heard in Mississauga on July 11, 2017.
 
Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, S S (‘SS’),
attended the hearing.  I waited until 10:50 am before calling this
matter forward to be heard on an uncontested basis.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 Application
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from April 1, 2017 to July 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective June 12, 2017.
2.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $800.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
3.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from December 1, 2016
to June 12, 2017.
L2
Application – N5 Notice
4.     
The N5 notice of termination underlying the application was served
on June 1, 2017, and clearly identified the alleged noise and harassment of the
upstairs tenants, causing them to move out, and the alleged undue damage to the
main door jamb of the rental unit.   The Landlord identified $300.00 as the
estimated cost to repair the door jamb.
5.      SS
submitted exhibit LL#1, which is a copy of a February 16, 2017 email from the
ex-tenants upstairs to WB complaining about excessive noise coming from the
rental unit, and the Tenant’s boyfriend’s abusive and aggressive behaviour.
6.      SS
claimed the upstairs tenants ended up leaving because of the Tenant’s and her
boyfriend’s actions.   SS stated the Landlord moved into the upstairs unit as
of July 1, 2017.
7.      I
note that the allegation relating to the Tenant’s actions toward the upstairs
tenants does not provide any clear direction on how the Tenant is to void the
N5 notice.  Nothing further was provided at this hearing in the way of evidence
or submissions to either address the seven-day voiding period or any subsequent
noise or harassing actions by the Tenant.  As such, I am unable to consider
this particular allegation any further, and am denying it.
8.      SS
was unable to submit actual photographs into the record, but did present photos
on her handheld device, depicting the damage to the main door jamb as of May
29, 2017.  I noted for the record that the photos show substantial damage to the
door jamb.  In my view, the damage was undue and was caused by wilful or
negligent action.
9.      SS
affirmed that the Tenant did not repair the door jamb, neither did the Tenant
pay the Landlord to repair the door jamb.
10.   SS
was unable to submit any estimates or bills paid to evidence the cost to repair
the door jamb.
11.   Based
on the uncontested submissions on the damaged door jamb, I find that the Tenant
did not void the N5 Notice within the seven-day period provided for under
subsection 64(3) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).  
As a result, and taking into account the evidence submitted, I find that the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the unit has
wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises.
12.   I
indicated orally that I will not terminate the tenancy because of this
particular finding.  Instead, the Tenant will be ordered to replace the damaged
main door jamb in a reasonable period of time, failing which I will order the
Landlord to do the repair work which will be reimbursed by the Tenant.
L2
Application – N8 Notice
13.   The
tenancy commenced on December 1, 2016 and since then, the Landlord testified
the Tenant has been late in paying rent every month starting on January 1,
2017. 
14.   The
Landlord’s Legal Representative submitted the Landlord gave notices of lateness
to the Tenant, and in fact filed a previous L1 application, under CEL-64274-17,
which was subsequently withdrawn by the Landlord.
15.   I find the Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the
date it was due.
16.   The
Landlord submitted a copy of the signed lease (exhibit LL#2), to evidence the
term ends on November 30, 2017.
Section
83
17.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
L1 Application
 
Arrears
of Rent
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before August 6, 2017.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,266.44*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to July 26, 2017, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $26.30 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting July 27, 2017 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before August
6, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from August 7, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before August 6, 2017, then starting August 7,
2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after August 7, 2017.
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $3,390.00 if the payment is made on or before July 31, 2017, or
ii)       $4,190.00 if the payment is made on or before August 6, 2017**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after August 7, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
L2
Application
N5 Wilful and/or Negligent
Damage
10.   The
Tenant shall repair the damaged main door jamb to an original condition on or
before August 18, 2017.  If the Tenant complies with this repair as ordered,
this will represent full and final settlement in respect of damages claimed in
the application to the main door jamb.
11.   If
the Tenant fails to repair the damaged main door jamb to its original
condition on or before August 18, 2017, the Landlord shall be entitled to
repair the main door jamb and seek reimbursement from the Tenant up to a
maximum amount of $300.00.  Once the Landlord has repaired the door jamb, the
Landlord must submit to the Tenant a true copy of the invoice or bill paid, to
evidence the dollar amount spent by the Landlord in repairing the door jamb.
12.   If
the Tenant fails to repair the damaged main door jamb to its original
condition on or before August 18, 2017, then the amount specified in paragraph
11 above shall become due and payable immediately and the Tenant will start to
owe interest as of the date the Landlord submits the amount for reimbursement
to the Tenant.  This will be simple interest calculated at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding from the submission date onwards.
N8
Persistently Late in Paying Rent
13.   Even
if the Tenant voids the L1 application portion of the order above for arrears
of rent, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated in a
final way (non-remedial) as of November 30, 2017.  
14.   The
Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before November 30, 2017.
15.   If
the unit is not vacated on or before November 30, 2017, then starting December
1, 2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
16.   Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after December 1,
2017.
