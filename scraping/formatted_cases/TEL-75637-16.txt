Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-75637-16
 










 
 
 

M.L.M.I..
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict G.B.
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on January 25, 2017.
 
The Landlord’s representative, R.A., and the Tenant attended the
hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent he was required to pay for the period from
November 1, 2016 to January 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective November 22, 2016.
2.     
The arrears of rent owing for the
period ending January 31, 2017, total $1,772.15.
3.     
The Landlord incurred costs as a
result of filing the application in the amount of $170.00 and is entitled to
reimbursement for those costs. 
4.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $879.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2016
to November 22, 2016, in the amount of $15.76.
6.      The
Tenant paid $917.59 after the application was filed.
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
8.      The Tenant
is seeking relief in the form of a short delay to gather all the required
funds. The Tenant says that her loans are now paid off, she is working full
time and she has qualified for significant monetary relief from the rent bank
which will help her pay off the arrears. 
9.      The Tenant
produced a letter from the Toronto Rent Bank dated January 24, 2017, which
confirms that she has qualified for $1,963.16 and this will be processed within
7-10 business days. 
10.   As this
amount exceeds the outstanding arrears and as the date of this order is already
10 business days from the date of the letter, the Tenant should have no trouble
paying the outstanding arrears within the standard 11 days that the Landlord is
seeking. 
11.   Based on
the evidence before me, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the
Tenant is able to pay the arrears within 11 days of this order and it would be
unfair to the Landlord to cause any additional delay.   
It
is ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before February 19, 2017.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,135.58*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to February 8, 2017, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $29.48 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 9, 2017 to the date he moves out of the unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $170.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
February 19, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from February 20, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 19, 2017, then starting February
20, 2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 20,
2017.
8.      If,
on or before February 19, 2017, the Tenant pays the amount of $2,838.73** to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. 
This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain
in the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 20, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
