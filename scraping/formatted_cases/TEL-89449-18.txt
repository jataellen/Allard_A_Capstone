Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
 
 
File Number: TEL-89449-18
 











 
 
 

D. G. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict T. P. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on April 11,
2018.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s
representative J. T. and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
 Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from January 1, 2018
to April 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective March 14, 2018.
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $2,450.00 from the Tenant and this deposit was applied to the
month of February 2018, on the Tenant’s request. 
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from December 31, 2017 to March 14, 2018
in the amount of $8.94.
4.     
At the hearing, the Tenant
was asked to explain the circumstances that led to the significant rental
arrears that had accumulated during his tenancy. He testified that he suffered
a setback in the work place, so he stopped paying rent for February, March and
April 2018.
5.     
He attributed his financial
set back to stress and lack of sleep. He stated that there was a problem with
noise coming from another tenant’s rental unit that had caused both his wife
and he to suffer from exhaustion, and to be unable to work. The Tenant did not
provide 
 
 
any supporting medical evidence that may explain why he and
his wife could not work due to lack of sleep.
6.     
In a letter dated January
25, 2018 the Tenant gave the Landlord a promissory note with respect to rental
arrears and unpaid utility bills and asked to use his last month’s rent for
February 2018, stating an intention to vacate on February 28, 2018. The tenant
did not leave the rental unit as promised and asked for some extra time to
vacate at the hearing.
7.     
The Landlord is requesting a
non-remedial order however pursuant to section 74(3) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006, the Board cannot make a non-remedial order on an L1
application.
8.     
The Landlord has provided a
ledger sheet which reflects payment patterns dating back to September 2017.
While the Tenant testified that he only had problems meeting his rental obligation
starting in February 2018, and attributed this to a lack of sleep staring in
November, the ledger sheet confirms that the Tenant has not been able to pay
his rent in full and on time dating back to September 2017. Payments are
scattered throughout the month and some payments fall in to another month.
9.     
The Landlord’s evidence is
that the tenancy has been financially crippling for him and extremely
stressful. The Tenant was asked why he had not made some partial payments
toward the rent and he testified that he preferred to wait and explain at the
hearing. With no evidence of a genuine intention to pay arrears, and no
realistic payment plan in place, the Board had no confidence that the Tenant
would ever rectify the large arrears situation that he found himself in.
10.  
The Landlord confirmed that
he responded to the Tenant noise complaints promptly and he provided the N5
notice that was served on the other tenants in response to the Tenant
complaints. The Tenant acknowledged that the other tenants apologized to him
after the Landlord spoke to them.
11.  
Overall the Landlord gave
the most consistent and reliable evidence at the hearing. I do not find that
the Tenant failure to pay rent in full and on time, can be attributed to
fatigue from noisy tenants. The inability to meet rental obligations started
before the noise complaints as is established by the ledger sheet.
12.  
The Tenant was asked about
his family situation. He testified that he lives with his daughter, son and
wife, however, his daughter is moving out from the family home. The Tenant’s
son is still in school. For this reason he wished to delay eviction.
13.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
14.  
The Tenant requested some
extra time before being evicted from the rental unit which has been achieved by
virtue of the fact that this order was not written immediately after the April
11, 2018 hearing.
15.  
In consideration of the
significant arrears and the Landlord’s reliance on the Tenant’s offer to
terminate at the end of February, and the Tenant’s failure to provide reliable
evidence of a viable repayment plan or intention to repay, I find the Landlord’s
circumstances to be most compelling. 
16.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before May 15,
2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $5,226.78*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to May 4, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $80.55 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
May 5, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May 15, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from May 16,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before May 15, 2018, then starting May 16, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 16, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before May 15,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $9,990.00** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after May 16, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
