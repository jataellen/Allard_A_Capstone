Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-96267-18
 











 
 

#.O.I (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict M.M-A.H (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard
in Toronto on August 20, 2018.
 
The
Landlord’s property manager, B.F, and the Landlord’s legal representative, B.R,
and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
At the
hearing the Tenant’s name was corrected in the title of proceedings.
 
 Determinations:
 
1.     
The Landlord acquired the rental complex from N.C.L
(N) in or about 2011.
2.     
The Tenant has not paid the total rent she was
required to pay for the period from February 1, 2018 to August 31, 2018. 
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
May 19, 2018.
3.     
The Tenant paid $2,210.00 after the application
was filed. After this payment, but prior to any determination with respect to
the application filing fee and the claims raised by the Tenant pursuant to
section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, the Tenant owed $91.18
for the period ending on August 31, 2018.
4.     
In response to the Landlord’s claims for rent
arrears, the Tenant claimed, as permitted by section 82 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”), that she is entitled to recover from the
Landlord $140.00for lost wages for one day, $350.00 for illegal use of her
parking space and reimbursement for her stay at a hotel in the amount of
$284.28 while the floors in her unit were being repaired. In a written
statement dated June 25, 2018 the Tenant titled her claim as “Present my counter
argument of Harassment, Illegal Entry, and misuse of leased property”.
5.     
The Tenant and the Landlord are agreed that the
Tenant has occupied the rental unit as a tenant since November 2003 when she
and her son began to share the unit with her nephew, Winston Edmund (WE), who had
acquired the unit by inheritance from his aunt, Amy Brown (AB).  WE had shared
it with Herbert Pitters (HP) from 1998 to 2009. AB was a party to the only
written lease of the unit. It was made on May 22, 1981 by AB and another person
as tenants and Numat as landlord (the “1981 Lease”). In the place where the
1981 Lease asks the tenants to declare the number of cars they have, it is
written “No Car”.
Parking
Space
6.     
The Tenant asserts that her tenancy agreement
includes use of an assigned parking space which the Landlord has attempted to
remove. For the Tenant to succeed on her claim with respect to the Landlord’s
use of her alleged parking space, it is necessary to determine whether there is
a parking space that is included in the rent the Tenant is paying for the unit.
7.     
HP, who is too ill to attend the hearing,
provided a written statement dated July 31, 2018 and signed on August 20, 2018 in
which he wrote that the 1985 the lease agreement included parking space 51 on
the first level of the basement parking and another parking space on the lower
level. He also wrote that he lost the 1985 lease during his move out of the
unit in 2009. 
8.     
The Landlord is not aware of any lease with
respect to the rental unit other than the 1981 Lease.
9.     
The Landlord’s superintendent testified he did
not know the Tenant had a parking space.
10.  
The Landlord’s property manager candidly stated
that 7 or 8 years ago parking was not assigned - the tenant was asked if they
had a car and it was so noted. However, currently, a parking spot is written
into the lease and the tenant is charged for it. She said according to the
Landlord’s records, which were not submitted into evidence, parking spot 51 is
not assigned to the Tenant’s unit. She also said the Tenant’s son has been
using that space but it has only been since 2017 when he obtained his car.
11.  
None of the Landlord’s representatives had an
explanation for why it was that the Tenant had a key to the parking garage if
it were not for the fact that parking was included with her rent. The
superintendent said for the past 5 years that he has worked at the residential
complex everyone who has a key to the parking area has paid a key deposit. He
suggested the Tenant found someone else’s key but he declined to question her
honesty. It is noteworthy that throughout the course of his testimony he
indicated his job does not include dealing with parking.
12.  
I accept the testimony of the Tenant when she
says her unit has parking space 51 included in the rent. She has had a key to
the parking garage since 2003 when it was passed on to her by HP. HP’s
statement supports her claim that parking was allocated to the unit in 1985 as
part of the rent under the 1981 Lease.  I also am satisfied the Tenant’s mother
and son have been regularly using space 51 when visiting the Tenant.
13.  
With respect to the Tenant’s claim for $350.00
for illegal use of her parking space, the Tenant’s ability to use her parking
space was only disrupted on one occasion that it was proven the space was
occupied by another car. Therefore this claim will not be allowed.
Hotel Stay
14.  
The Landlord gave the Tenant a one-week-notice
for work to be done on the Tenant’s floors, requiring the Tenant to vacate the
unit for twenty-four hours. The Tenant said that she intended to stay at her
mother’s place with her dog but learned the day she had to vacate her unit that
her mother’s apartment had bedbugs. Consequently, the Tenant alerted the Landlord’s
personnel that she needed a unit in the residential complex but was informed
the unit that was unoccupied was under renovation and no one could stay in it.  

15.  
As it is the Landlord’s responsibility to
maintain the rental unit, it follows that the landlord is responsible for the
reasonable expenses incurred when a landlord requires a tenant to move out of
their rent unit to perform maintenance: see for instance Order TST-96698-18. I
am satisfied the Tenant’s hotel expenses are reasonable and therefore should be
reimbursed in the amount of $284.28. This amount shall be applied to the rent
arrears owing by the Tenant.
Wages Lost
16.  
I agree with the Landlord the Tenant did not
prove her claim for lost wages. Accordingly, I decline to make an award in
respect of this claim.
Illegal
Entry and Harassment
17.  
The Tenant provided some evidence with respect
to her illegal entry and harassment allegations as did the Landlord; however,
the Tenant did not present in writing a claim for monetary compensation in respect
of them as she had done with her other claims nor did she ask for a remedy in
respect of them at the hearing. Consequently, and without considering the
merits of these matters, I will not allow these claims. 
18.  
Accordingly, the Tenant is entitled to an
abatement of rent of $284.28 for hotel expenses.
19.  
I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including the relatively small amount of
arrears owed and the offsetting abatement, and find that it would be unfair not
to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
 
 
It
is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord arrears of
rent of $91.18 for the period ending on August 31, 2018 and the application
filing fee of $190.00.
2.     
The Landlord shall pay the Tenant a rent
abatement in the amount of $284.28.
3.     
Once the rent abatement is applied to the rent
arrears and costs, the Tenant has a credit balance of $3.10* to the end of
August 2018.The Tenant may offset the sum of $3.10 against future rent owed to
the Landlord.
