Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-87479-18
 










 
 
 

E. A. M.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict J. M.
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes;
because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord in
a residential complex that has three or fewer residential units; and because
the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of
residential occupation. 
 
This
application was heard in Whitby on January 29, 2018.
 
Only
the Landlord attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      This
application involves a small residential complex where the Landlord lives in
the basement directly below the Tenant’s rental unit. 
2.      This
application seeks an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant on
three different bases. For the reasons that follow, the tenancy shall be
terminated based on the Landlord’s N7 notice of termination. The Tenant’s
behaviour has substantially interfered with the Landlord’s reasonable
enjoyment. 
3.      For
some time the Tenant’s behaviour in the upper unit has interfered with the
Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment including his ability to sleep. 
4.      For
example, at 3:30 in the morning on December 10, 2017 the Landlord could not
sleep due to loud music in the Tenant’s unit. The same thing happened on
December 26, 2017 at 11 p.m. 
5.      There
are also problems with the heat controls which are physically located in the
Tenant’s rental unit. There have been numerous occasions when the Landlord has
been physically uncomfortable because of lack of heat or too much heat and has
had to ask the Tenant to adjust the temperature. 
6.      Finally,
the Tenant smokes in the rental unit which the Landlord can smell in the
basement. His requests that she stop smoking in the rental unit go unheeded. 
7.      Given
the evidence before the Board I am satisfied that the Tenant’s behaviour has
substantially interfered with the Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment in a
residential complex with three or fewer residential units. As a result, it is
not necessary to consider the Landlord’s evidence or application with respect
to Landlord’s own use. 
8.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Landlord is unaware of any circumstances that
would justify refusing or delaying eviction. The Tenant lives alone and is
working. 
9.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from September 1, 2017 to January 31, 2018.  
10.   The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending January 31, 2018 total $5,100.00. 
11.   The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,550.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
shall be applied to the rent due for the last month of the tenancy. 
12.   Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 26, 2017 to
December 26, 2017 totalling $11.72. This amount shall also be offset against
rent arrears owing. 
13.   The
Landlord incurred costs of $190.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
14.   This
order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further
reasons shall be issued.
It is
ordered that:
1.      The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before February 10, 2018.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $3,546.81, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 30, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $50.96 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting January 31, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before
February 10, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from February 11, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 10, 2018, then starting February
11, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 11,
2018.
