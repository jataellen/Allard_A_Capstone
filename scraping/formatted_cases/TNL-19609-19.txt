Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-19609-19










 
 
 

DIL
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict EAM
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the
Tenant's rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on January 15, 2020.
 
The Landlord’s representative, BR, and the Tenant attended the
hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
2.      At
the hearing, the Tenant agreed with the Landlord’s evidence that the Tenant has
been persistently late in paying the rent.  The Landlord’s evidence shows that
the Tenant has paid the rent late every month from October 2018 to January
2020.
 
3.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $11,387.96 from the Tenant and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
4.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2019
to October 31, 2019
 
5.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 29,
2020, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
6.      At
the hearing, the Tenant requested relief from eviction.  The Tenant testified
that he will pay the rent on time, starting February 1, 2020.
 
7.      I
find, however, that the Tenant’s evidence of his potential income from two jobs
is not reliable.  The Tenant was not able to give a reasonably accurate
estimate of his income from a part-time job with a friend’s courier business;
and evidence that the Tenant started working at a full-time job on January 14,
2020 is inconsistent with his evidence that he will be able to pay the arrears
he owes to the Landlord for the period ending January 31, 2020 and the full rent
on February 1, 2020.
 
8.      The
Tenant’s evidence that he expects to receive payment from a $3,000.00 loan he
made to a friend in 2017 is also not reliable.  Although the Tenant asserted
that his friend is able to repay the loan at this time, there was no reliable
evidence of the debtor’s financial circumstances to determine that the Tenant
will receive the payment in the near future.
 
9.      The
Tenant did not have information about his partner’s income.  
 
10.   Based
on the totality of the evidence adduced at the hearing, I conclude that the
Tenant did not prove that he is able to pay the monthly rent as it becomes due
and payable on the first day of each month.  Indeed, the Landlord adduced
evidence that this present application is the Landlord’s ninth application to the
Board for matters related to rent.
 
11.   I
therefore find that it is appropriate to terminate the tenancy.
 
12.   However,
the Landlord is holding a rent deposit from the Tenant and the Tenant’s
household, which includes a young child, will require additional time to find
new accommodations.  I therefore conclude that it is not unfair under the
circumstances to postpone the eviction date to February 29, 2020.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated, as of February 29,
2020.  The Tenant must move out of the
rental unit on or before February 29, 2020.
 
2.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 29, 2020, then starting March 1,
2020, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 1, 2020.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing on or before January 27, 2020, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from January
28, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
