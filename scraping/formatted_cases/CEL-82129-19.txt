Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 











 

SRI (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict JN and TN (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay
the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Barrie on April 15,
2019.
 
The Landlord’s Legal
Representative, the Landlord’s Superintendent, VD, and one of the Tenants, TN,
attended the hearing.
 
An Interim order CEL-82129-19-IN1
was issued on February 11, 2019.
 
At the hearing the Tenants raised
the following issues pursuant to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'): No hot water, cracked window, broken toilet seat,
mold on the baseboards, the unit was not cleaned or painted upon move in,
harassment, and substantial interference with the Tenants’ reasonable enjoyment
of the rental unit.
 
The following witness testified at
the hearing:
JM (Property Manager) on behalf of
the Landlord
 
Determinations and reasons:
 
Rent arrears
 
1.     
TN did not dispute the rent
arrears of $2,940.01 owing to April 30, 2019 as claimed by the Landlord in this
application. 
2.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from December 1,
2018 to April 30, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice
of Termination effective December 18, 2018.
3.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,185.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
4.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from December 18, 2017 to December 18,
2018.
5.     
The Tenants paid $2,984.99
after the application was filed.
Section 82
6.     
TN alleged that the Landlord
failed to maintain the rental unit in a good state of repair and fit for
habitation as there was no hot water since she moved into the rental unit,
there is a cracked window in the second bedroom, the toilet seat was broken,
there was mold on the baseboards in the hot water tank room, and the unit was
not cleaned or painted upon commencement of the tenancy. 
7.     
TN also alleged that the
Landlord’s conduct of showing up at the unit door without notice on November 2,
2018 and again in mid-November 2018 was harassment.  She further alleged that
the Landlord’s constant watching and reporting of her or her guest’s activities
as seen on the security cameras is harassment.  The Landlord’s staff are also
approaching the Tenants’ guests and standing outside her entry door at times. 
She submitted that the Landlord’s conduct substantially interfered with her and
her daughter’s reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit.
8.     
Subsection 20(1) of the Act
states the following:
A landlord is responsible for providing and maintaining a
residential complex, including the rental units in it, in a good state of
repair and fit for habitation and for complying with health, safety, housing
and maintenance standards.
9.     
In the recent decision in Onyskiw
v. CJM Property Management, 2016 ONCA 477 (Onyskiw), the Court of
Appeal for Ontario determined that a contextual approach should be adopted when
considering a landlord’s potential breach of subsection 20(1) of the Act and a
breach will not be found if the landlord’s response to a maintenance issue was
reasonable in the circumstances. 
10.   Section 22 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) states the following:
A
landlord shall not at any time during a tenant’s occupancy of a rental unit and
before the day on which an order evicting the tenant is executed substantially
interfere with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or the residential
complex in which it is located for all usual purposes by a tenant or members of
his or her household. 
11.   Section 23 of the Act states the following:
A
landlord shall not harass, obstruct, coerce, threaten or interfere with a
tenant. 
12.  
For the reasons stated
below, I am satisfied that the Landlord breached section 20 of the Act for
failing to respond reasonably to issues with the hot water tank, bedroom window
and toilet seat.  I am not satisfied that the Landlord’s conduct amounted to
harassment.  I am also not satisfied that the Landlord’s conduct amounted to a
substantial interference with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit. 
Hot water tank
13.  
TN reported to the Landlord
an issue with hot water in her unit just after moving into the rental unit. 
Her first request for maintenance form was dated November 9, 2018.  Although,
TN confirmed that the form was given to the head of the tenants’ association
and not the Landlord, the Landlord did not deny that they were made aware of an
issue with hot water in the rental unit.
14.  
The Landlord’s Property
Manager, JM, confirmed that the previous hot water tank in the rental unit was
approximately eighteen years old and perhaps was past its useful life.  In
accordance with Ontario Regulation 516/06, the weighted useful life of a
“hot water boiler” is fifteen years.
15.  
As per interim order
CEL-82129-19 issued on February 11, 2019, the Landlord was ordered to install a
fully functional hot water tank by midnight of February 13, 2019.  There was no
dispute that the Landlord installed a new hot water tank at the rental unit on
February 26, 2019.  TN argued that the Landlord breached the interim order and
as such she is entitled to a 50% abatement for February 2019 as stated in the
interim order. 
16.  
It is not uncommon for a
landlord to be ordered pursuant to an interim order to correct a possible serious
maintenance breach such as an issue with hot water, which is a vital service. 
However, I find that the requirement to install or replace a water tank within
48 hours imposed a standard that was most likely impossible for the Landlord to
meet.  
17.  
The Landlord was able to
have a new hot water tank installed and fully functioning within two weeks of
the interim order.  I find this timeframe reasonable given that the order had
to be forwarded to the property manager, a hot water tank would have to be
sized, ordered, delivered, and installed.  There was also evidence that
additional components for the tank had to be purchased separately and were done
so at varying retailers.  
18.  
Despite the fact that I find
that the Landlord reasonably and substantially complied with the interim
order.  The Tenants’ issue was a lack of hot water in the rental unit as
reported since November 9, 2018.  Given the age of the previous hot water tank
and that it was past its useful life, I find it more likely than not that the
Tenants experienced issues with hot water at the rental unit from November 9,
2018 to February 26, 2019. 
19.  
However, since TN still
maintains that there are issues with hot water at the unit even after receiving
a new hot water tank, I am not convinced that there was no hot water during the
period of November 9, 2018 to February 26, 2019.  I find it more likely than
not that it is simply an issue of the Tenants expecting a higher standard than
that which is reasonable and/or warranted.  Especially, given the Landlord’s
direct evidence of the water in a filled bathtub maintaining a temperature over
111 degrees Celsius. 
20.  
Consequently, I find that
the Tenant is only entitled to an abatement of rent of $592.50, representing a half
month’s rent for the period of November 9, 2018 to February 26, 2019.  This is
the amount ordered in the interim order and conceded by the Landlord. 
Cracked window
21.  
There is no dispute that the
window in the second bedroom is cracked.  The best evidence before me regarding
when the Tenants informed the Landlord of this issue was the Tenants’ request
for maintenance form dated December 17, 2018.  The Landlord only recently, on
March 18, 2019, ordered a replacement window.  Since it took over three months
for the Landlord to respond to this issue, I find this to be unreasonable and it
amounts to a breach of section 20 of the Act.
22.  
JM stated that this is a two
pane window and only the interior pane is cracked.  As such the rental unit is not
compromised by the exterior elements.   He confirmed that a new window has been
ordered and they are awaiting delivery to confirm an install date. 
23.  
TN disputed that the window
is two panes, however the evidence before me was insufficient to refute JM’s
testimony.  He was candid and forthcoming.  Also, since the invoice for the
replacement window states “supply and install 3 sealed units to include low E
and argon gas with super spacer,” I am satisfied that the existing window is also
double pane window, why else would argon gas and a spacer be present.  
24.  
TN stated that as a result
of the cracked window she has been unable to use the second bedroom.  Given
that the window is a double pane glass, I am not convinced that this crack
renders the bedroom completely unusable.  However, I am satisfied that there is
some impact on the Tenants by having this large crack in the second bedroom
window.  
25.  
Therefore, I find that the an
abatement of rent of 5% for the months of December 2018, January, February,
March and April 2019 to be appropriate in these circumstances.  The Tenants are
entitled to an abatement of rent totalling $296.25 ($1,185.00 x .05 x 5) for
this issue. 
Toilet seat
26.  
There was no dispute that
the toilet seat in the rental unit was broken.  According to JM, the seat was
floating as the attachments to the base were broken.  The best evidence before
me regarding when the Tenants informed the Landlord of this issue was the
Tenants’ request for maintenance form dated December 17, 2018.  The toilet seat
was replaced on February 21, 2019.  Since it took over two months for the
Landlord to respond to this issue, I find this to be unreasonable and it amounts
to a breach of section 20 of the Act.
27.  
TN did not provide specific
evidence regarding the impact of this broken toilet seat had on the Tenants.  I
find it more likely than not that the impact was minor.  Therefore, I find that
the Tenants are entitled to a lump sum abatement of rent of $50.00 which is
both appropriate and proportionate in these circumstances. 
Baseboard mold
28.  
TN stated that there was mold
on the baseboards in the room that houses the hot water tank.  She undertook to
clean it.  
29.  
The evidence before me was
insufficient to find that this issue was reported to the Landlord.  TN relied
on four request for maintenance forms submitted for the period of November 2018
to March 2019.  This issue is not mentioned on any of those forms. As well,
there was no dispute that the issue was not addressed with the TN’s initial cleaning
of the area.  JM also stated that cleaned the area behind the hot water tank prior
to the installation of the new hot water tank.
 
Unclean and unpainted unit
30.  
TN alleged that when she
moved into the unit, it had not been cleaned or painted.  There was no dispute
that this tenancy was to commence on November 1, 2018.  However, there was no
dispute that Tenants were in possession of the rental unit prior to this date. 

31.  
VD stated that she found the
rental unit insecure and occupied by the Tenants around October 18, 2018 during
an inspection to get the unit ready for the new tenancy.  
32.  
Given the uncontested
evidence, I find it likely that the Tenants had or took possession of the
rental unit early.  As such, the Landlord did not have an opportunity to clean
and prepare the unit.  The Tenants occupied the rental unit for the period of
October 18, 2018 to October 31, 2018 prior to the tenancy commencing and were
not required to pay rent.  I find it likely that the Tenants occupied the unit
early in exchange for cleaning and painting the unit at their own costs. 
Harassment
33.  
TN stated that there were
two occasions in November 2018 where the Landlord’s Agents, four people in
total, showed up at the rental unit without any notice.  TN confirmed that they
were there to do maintenance checks. However, they did not enter the unit. 
34.  
Based on the evidence before
me, I am not satisfied that these two incidents amount to harassment.  There
was no dispute that the Landlord’s Agents were simply there to do maintenance
checks.  They did not enter the unit, therefore there was no unlawful entry
either.  
35.  
TN stated that the
Superintendent is watching the cameras and making notes of her and her guests’
activities.  There is no dispute that the common areas of the residential
complex are equipped with cameras. 
36.  
VD testified that as part of
her duties, she reviews the videotape from the previous night.  According to
her, there were security issues in the past and now checking and following up
on potential issues found on the videotape is standard protocol.  She stated
that TN is not singled out, all activities in the common areas are being
monitored. 
37.  
Based on the evidence before
me, I am not satisfied that the Superintendent’s conduct amounts to
harassment.  While I understand that TN is upset at her activities being seen
on camera, she was advised and is aware that the cameras are present and being
monitored. Consequently, there is a reasonable expectation that activities in
the area are monitored.  Whether or not the Superintendent takes notes of the
activities seen on the videotape on its own also does not amount to
harassment.  There was insufficient evidence before me that these notes were
disclosed to anyone other than the Tenant. 
38.  
There was insufficient
evidence before me that the Superintendent or another agent of the Landlord
harassed the Tenants’ guests or the Tenants by standing near their door.  TN
did not provide any specific dates when these alleged interactions occurred. 
39.  
Given the above findings,
the Tenant is entitled to an abatement of rent totalling $938.75.
Section 83 
40.  
TN had requested and hoped
for a complete offset of the rent arrears as a result of the issues raised
pursuant to section 82 of the Act.  TN submitted that she is disabled and not
capable of moving.  She also mentioned that the year prior to residing at the
rental unit she was living in a shelter.  
41.  
The Landlord requested an
order for payment of the rent arrears and eviction if not paid in the standard
time frame.  
42.  
Having considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, I find
that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.
43.  
This tenancy only commenced
as of November 1, 2018 and the rent arrears claimed in this application are
owing since December 1, 2018.  The rent arrears owing are now substantial.  TN offered
no ability to pay the arrears.  The Tenants also did not fully comply with the
payment requirement in the interim order.  Given the short history of this
tenancy combined with the substantial rent arrears owing and no ability to pay,
it would be unfair to grant any relief from eviction. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before May 6,
2019.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $558.02*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to April 25, 2019, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit and less the amount of the abatement the Landlord owes the
Tenants.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $38.96 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting April 26, 2019 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May 6, 2019, the Tenants will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from May 7, 2019
at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before May 6, 2019, then starting May 7, 2019, the Landlord may file this
order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 7, 2019.
8.     
If the Tenants wish to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $2,191.26 if the payment is made on or before April 30, 2019, or
ii)       $3,376.26 if the payment is made on or before May 6, 2019**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after May 7, 2019 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make
this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
