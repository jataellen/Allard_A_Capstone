Order under Section
21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: TNL-01365-18-RV
 
 
Review Order
 
PM
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict KH
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was resolved by order TNL-01365-18 issued on March 2, 2018.
 
On March 20, 2018, the Tenant requested a review of the order, and that
the order be stayed until the request to review the order is resolved.
 
On
March 21, 2018, interim order TNL-01365-18-RV-IN was issued, staying the order
issued on March 2, 2018.
 
The request was heard in Toronto on April 13, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      Since
the Tenant did not attend the review hearing to support the Tenant’s review
request, I find that the request has been abandoned.
 It
is ordered that:
1.      The
request to review order TNL-01365-18 issued on March 2, 2018 is denied. The
order is confirmed and remains unchanged.
 
2.      The
interim order issued on March 21, 2018 is
cancelled. The stay of order TNL-01365-18 is lifted.
