Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-02210-18










 

JSI
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict BH
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes;
and because he has been persistently late in paying his rent. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on March 22, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord’s representative, BR, attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent he was required to pay for the period from
December 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective January 23, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenant has been persistently late in paying the rent.  The Tenant has paid the
rent late every month since July 2017.
 
3.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $855.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
4.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from December 5, 2012
to January 23, 2018.
 
5.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
6.      The
Tenant did not attend the hearing to give evidence of the Tenant’s circumstances.
It is ordered that:
 
The Application for Non-payment of Rent
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids this part of the eviction order for non-payment of rent as set
out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The
Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before April 6, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,559.25*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to March 26, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $29.12 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting March 27, 2018 to the date he moves out of the unit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before April
6, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from April 7, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 6, 2018, then starting April 7,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 7, 2018.
 
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy to April 30,
2018, when the tenancy will be terminated for the Tenant’s persistent late
payment of rent, she must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $2,860.00 if the payment is made on or before March 31, 2018, or
ii)       $3,745.64 if the payment is made on or before April 6, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this part of the eviction order if they pay the amount required under
that subsection on or after April 7, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant
possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord. 
The
Application for Persistent Late Payment of Rent
10.   If
the Tenant voids the part of this eviction order for non-payment of rent,
above, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated, as of April
30, 2018, because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the rent. 
The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before April 30,
2018.
 
11.   The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $29.12 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from May 1, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
12.   If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 30, 2018, then starting May 1, 2018,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
13.   Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after May 1, 2018.
