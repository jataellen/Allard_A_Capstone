Order under Sections 69, 89
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-08731-18










 

RR
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict MM
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the
Tenant's rent. 
The
Landlord also applied for an order determining that the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential
complex has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises; and
also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for
the damage.
 
This
application was heard in Newmarket on October 29, 2018.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s representative MS, the Tenant and the
Tenant’s representative, GO, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Landlord’s claim for damage to the rental property or residential complex is
based on a fine the Landlord was required to pay to the regional municipality
because the Tenant stored abandoned vehicles at the property, and for water
bills arrears.  I determined at the hearing that these matters are not
“damage”, as described in section 89 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the ‘Act’).  I therefore declined to hear the Landlord’s evidence and
submissions on these matters.  I did, however, advise the Landlord that she may
seek a remedy from the Board under a different section of the Act.  I
encouraged the Landlord to seek legal advice.
 
2.      The
Tenant has been persistently late in paying the rent.  The Tenant did not
dispute the Landlord’s evidence that the Tenant has persistently failed to pay
the rent as it becomes due and payable on the first day of each month.
 
3.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it would not be unfair to grant
relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. 

 
4.      At
the hearing, the Tenant requested relief from eviction.  The Tenant occupies
the rental unit with his adult son, who is a person with a mental health
disability.  The Tenant testified that his son’s disability has resulted in
several suicide attempts.  The Tenant himself has been diagnosed with cancer. 
The Tenant testified that he has set up a separate banking account that will
better enable him to make timely rental payments.  
 
5.      The
Landlord opposed relief from eviction.  The Landlord has had trouble paying the
mortgage and other financial obligations because of the Tenant’s late payment
history.
 
6.      I
sympathize with both parties.  Landlords are entitled to collect rent as it
becomes due and payable.  Without regular rental income, many small,
independent landlords may experience financial hardship.  The Act, however, is
remedial legislation, and the courts have determined that evicting a tenant is
a remedy of last resort:  Sutherland v. Lamontagne, [2008] O.J.
No. 5763 (Div. Ct.).  
 
7.      Since
this application is the first the Landlord has brought against the Tenant for
issues relating to rent, and also taking into consideration the Tenant’s
household’s circumstances, I find that it is not unfair to grant relief from
eviction, and to issue a conditional order requiring the Tenant to pay the rent
on time.  
 
8.      Since
this order is being issued on November 6, 2018, the Tenant shall be required to
pay rent to the Landlord for November 2018 no later than November 13, 2018. 
The Tenant shall be required to pay rent on the first day of each month
thereafter for a period of 11 months (December 1, 2018 to October 1, 2019).  If
the Tenant fails to make any of these rental payments in full and on time, the
Landlord shall have the right to apply to the Board for an eviction order
against the Tenant, without notice to the Tenant.  The Landlord must start such
an application within 30 days of the Tenant’s failure to make a timely rental
payment.
 
9.      The
Tenant shall also pay the Landlord’s Board filing costs.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
Tenant shall pay rent to the Landlord for November 2018 on or before November
13, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord rent on the first day of each month for
the period December 1, 2018 to October 1, 2019.
 
3.      If
the Tenants fail to make any payment in paragraphs one or two, above, the
Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Act, without notice to the Tenant,
for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant.  The Landlord
must commence an application under section 78 of the Act within 30 days of the
Tenant’s breach of paragraphs one or two, above.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before
November 17, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from November 18, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.      The
Landlord’s application under section 89 of the Act for compensation for damage
to the rental unit or residential complex is dismissed.
