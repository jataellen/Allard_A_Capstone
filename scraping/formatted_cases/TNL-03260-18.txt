Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-03260-18



 


 


 



 
 
 
RP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict RM (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was scheduled to be heard in Toronto
on April 17, 2018.  Both parties attended on that day. The Tenant raised a number of issues pursuant to s.82 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).  The matter was adjourned in order to give
the Tenant an opportunity to provide disclosure of all the issues he intended
to raise, and to present his evidence to the Landlord.  An Interim Order,
TNL-03260-18, was issued, and the Tenant was also ordered to pay all rent in
full, as of May 1, 2018, and going forward, until all the issues between the
parties were resolved.
 
The hearing reconvened on May 29, 2018.  The Landlord, (DM), and their witness, KP, attended the
reconvened hearing.  The Landlord testified that the Tenant failed to comply
with the Interim Order, and did not provide her with any disclosure of the s.82
issues or pay rent for the month of May, 2018.
 
The Tenant failed to attend the
reconvened hearing or send a representative.  I was satisfied that the parties
received a Notice of Hearing.  There was no request to adjourn before me. 
After waiting half an hour, I proceeded to determine the arrears application on
an uncontested basis.
 
 
Preliminary Issue:
 
1.    DM was present to represent the Landlord before
the Board.  DM is not licenced by the Law Society of Upper Canada to represent
parties before the Board, and I was not satisfied that he fit the criteria of
an exemption for unlicenced persons, of the SJTO Common Rules to represent
parties before the Board.  Consequently, the Landlord represented herself.
 
Determinations:
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from March 1, 2018 to
May 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective March 16, 2018.
 
2.     
The Tenant was in possession
of the rental unit at the time this application was filed.
 
3.     
The monthly rent is $750.00.
 
4.     
The Tenant has not paid any
rent since March, 2018.
 
5.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
 It is ordered that:
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before June 11,
2018.
 
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $2,268.68*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to May 31, 2018.
 
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $24.66 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
June 1, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 11, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June 12,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 11, 2018, then starting June 12, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 12, 2018.
 
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $2,425.00 if the payment is made on or before May 31, 2018, or
ii)       $3,175.00 if the payment is made on or before June 11, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after June 12, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
