Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-05257-18










 
 

MD
and MBN (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict EN and KN, (the 'Tenants'), because the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard in Newmarket on July 9, 2018.
 
The Landlords and the Tenants attended the hearing.  The Tenants’
Romanian-English language interpreter (son), IN, also attended the hearing.  
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from May 7, 2018 to August 6, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlords
served a Notice of Termination effective May 29, 2018.
 
2.      At
the hearing, the Tenants with the Landlords’ evidence that the Tenants’ rental
arrears for the period ending August 6, 2018 are $4,950.00.
 
3.      The
Tenant EN testified that she and her family are refugee claimants from
Romania.  Although EN testified that her household’s monthly income is greater
than the amount of rent payable each month, EN explained that the Tenants have
not paid rent to the Landlords, but instead have paid for food, clothing and
phone and internet bills.  When asked if the Tenants can afford the rental
unit, EN testified that they cannot.  EN did not propose a reasonable payment
plan that will allow the Tenants to pay the amount that they owe to the
Landlord.
 
4.      It
is evident from the Tenant EN’s testimony that the rental unit is
unaffordable.  Because the Tenants have prioritized other monthly expenses over
the monthly rent, I conclude that the Tenants cannot, or will not, pay the
amount they owe to the Landlord.  It is therefore appropriate to terminate the
tenancy and evict the Tenants from the rental unit.
 
5.      The
Landlords collected a rent deposit of $1,650.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlords.
 
6.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from March 8, 2018
to May 29, 2018.
 
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until August 23,
2018, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
8.      Although
the Tenants asked that the eviction be postponed until September 30, 2018, I
find that doing so will only cause additional rental arrears to accrue.  This
would result in unfairness to the Landlord.  However, because the Landlord is
holding a last month’s rental deposit, I find that it is not unfair to postpone
the eviction date by 30 days.  This will give the Tenants some additional time
to find new accommodations, while limiting the Landlord’s exposure to further
rental arrears.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before August 23, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $2,628.83*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to July 24, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $54.25 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting July 25, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before August
23, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from August 24, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before August 23, 2018, then starting August 24,
2018, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after August 24,
2018.
 
8.      If
the Tenants wish to void this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to
the Landlords or to the Board in trust:
i)        $5,140.00 if the payment is made on or before August 6, 2018, or
ii)       $6,790.00 if the payment is made on or before August 23, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after August 24, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlords. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
