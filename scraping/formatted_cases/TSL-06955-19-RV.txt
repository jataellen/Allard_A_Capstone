Tenancies Act, 2006

Review Order
 
 
MLPM # O L (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict F D S (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes. (L1 application)
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant has been persistently late
in paying the Tenant's rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each
day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date. (L2
application)
 
This L1/L2 application was resolved by order
TSL-06955-19 issued on August 8, 2019.
 
On August 19, 2019, the Tenant requested a review of
the order.
 
The request was heard in Toronto on September 19,
2019.
 
The Landlord’s legal
representative L. C and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
 Determinations:
 
Review
1.     
The Tenant’s review request
is on the ground of being not reasonably able to participate in the
proceedings. The Tenant did not attend the hearing that gave rise to the order
under review.
 
2.     
The Tenant’s review request
was not contested by the Landlord and so, at the hearing, I granted the review
request. The Landlord’s L1/L2 application proceeded de novo.
 
3.     
The Landlord seeks an order for $324.00 which is
the cost the Landlord incurred to file TSL-06955-19 issued on August 8, 2019 with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) for enforcement. This
amount is non-refundable. 
 
4.     
The Tenant objects to the Board awarding this
amount to the Landlord.
 
5.     
Pursuant to s. 204(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') the Board may order a party to an
application to pay the costs of another party. The Board’s Interpretation
Guideline 3 on Costs is silent on the issue of this enforcement fee but the Act
is not. In a slightly different context, subsection 74(15) of the Act makes it
very clear that if a landlord incurs non-refundable enforcement costs the
tenant must pay those costs if he or she wishes to remain in the unit and avoid
eviction. There is no discretion in the Board not to order a tenant to pay
those costs.
 
6.     
I believe that in these rare cases where a
Landlord has incurred a non-refundable fee to enforce the eviction but the
termination order is cancelled on review, the Tenant can and should be ordered
to compensate the Landlord for the non-refundable fee. In cases like this the tenant’s
request for a review is akin to a motion to void, in which tenants are ordered
to pay the Sheriff’s fee as a matter of course. In neither instance is the
tenant necessarily at fault. The main consideration is that a landlord, who is
also not at fault, has incurred a non-refundable fee when validly enforcing an
order to evict. 
 
7.     
Accordingly, the Tenant will
be ordered to compensate the Landlord for the Sheriff’s fee.
L1 application
8.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from April 1, 2019 to
September 30, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination.
 
9.     
The Tenant also owes the
Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
10.   The total amount owing is $4,047.15.
 
11.   I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it
would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the conditions set
out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. The
Tenant proposed a payment plan by which the arrears would be paid off in two
months.
 
L2 application
 
12.   The Tenant has paid rent persistently late.
 
13.   I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it
would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the conditions set
out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. The
Tenant needs time to recover from recent financial problems but once he has recovered
he will be able to pay rent promptly.
 
It is ordered that:
 
14.  
The Tenant’s request for a
review of order TSL-06955-19 is granted.
 
15.  
On or before January 31, 2020, the Tenant shall
pay the Landlord $324.00 for the non-refundable Sheriff’s fee.
 
16.  
Order TSL-06955-19 issued on
August 8, 2019 is cancelled and replaced by the following: 
Regarding the L1 application:
17.   The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4,047.15,
which represents the amount of rent owing up to September 30, 2019 and the
application fee.
18.  
The Tenant shall pay the
amount owing and rent that comes due according to the following schedule:

the breach and without notice to the Tenant, for an order terminating the
tenancy and evicting the Tenant.
