Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-90395-18
 











 
 
 

S.A. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict A.J. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes and because the Tenant has been persistently
late in paying his rent.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on June 11,
2018.
 
Only director of the company, S.C.,
and the Landlord’s superintendent, R.C., attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
THE APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF
RENT
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from April 1, 2018 to
June 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective April 17, 2018.
2.     
The outstanding arrears
owing for the period ending June 30, 2018, total $2,097.52. 
3.     
The Landlord paid $190.00
for the costs of filing the application and the Landlord is entitled to be
reimbursed for those costs. 
4.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,048.76 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 2, 2017 to April 17, 2018.
6.     
The Tenant paid $1,048.76
after the application was filed.
7.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
THE APPLICATION FOR PERSISTENTLY LATE PAYMENT
8.     
The Landlord served the
Tenant with a notice of termination which alleges that he has persistently late
in paying his rent. However, as I explained to the Landlord at the hearing, the
details on the notice do not substantiate the Landlord’s position. 
9.     
The notice of termination
says that the Tenant has been late paying his rent 3 times out of 6 from
September 2017, to February 2018. 
10.  
Based on the evidence before
me, I am not persuaded that paying his rent late 3 times constitutes being
“persistently late” as contemplated the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act'). For these reasons, the Landlord’s application is dismissed. 
It is ordered that:
THE APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before June 23,
2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $407.73*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to June 12, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $34.48 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
June 13, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 23, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June 24,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 23, 2018, then starting June 24, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 24, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before June 23,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $2,287.52** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after June 24, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
THE APPLICATION FOR PERSISTENTLY LATE PAYMENT
10.  
The Landlord’s application
is dismissed.
