Order under Section 21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-77282-18-RV
 










 
 

Review Order
 
E.K
(EK) and I.K (IK) (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict B.G (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes. (L1 application)
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evicting the
Tenant because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's
rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date. (L2 application)
 
This
application was resolved by order CEL-77282-18 issued on August 10, 2018.
 
On
August 16, 2018, the Tenant requested a review of the order, and that the order
be stayed until the request to review is resolved.
 
On
August 20, 2018, order CEL-77282-RV-IN was issued, staying the order issued on
August 10, 2018.
 
The
request was heard in Toronto on September 7, 2018.
 
The Landlord, I.K, and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Review
1.      The Tenant’s request for a review was based on the grounds of being
not reasonably able to participate in the proceedings. 
2.      The order under review was based on a hearing that was held on August
3, 2018. At the review hearing the Tenant testified that she arrived late for
the hearing on August 3, 2018 because of public transit and traffic problems.
The Tenant testified that she first went to the hearing room and the Board
member directed her to the Board’s service counter. The Tenant testified that
she had taken the day off of work to participate in the hearing. 
3.     
The Board’s records
show that the Tenant filled out a form at the Board’s service counter of the
Toronto North office. This form indicates that the Tenant attended at 2:10pm on
August 3, 2018. The Board’s records also indicate that the hearing was
scheduled to commence at 1:30pm. 
4.     
At the review hearing the Landlord IK testified
that she lives close to the rental unit and that she was able to attend the
hearing on time. 
5.     
The Divisional Court has
found that the grounds of “not reasonably able to participate” must be
interpreted broadly in the interests of natural justice and that a factor in
making a determination of this issue is whether the party genuinely intended to
participate in the proceedings. Interpreting this situation broadly, and
considering the Tenant took the day off for the original hearing, I am
satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the Tenant genuinely intended to
participate in the proceedings but was not reasonably able to participate. 
6.     
Accordingly, at the hearing
I granted the Tenant’s request for a review. The Landlord’s L1/L2 application
proceeded de novo. 
L1 application
7.     
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the
Tenant was required to pay for the period from April 1, 2018 to September 30,
2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination
effective June 29, 2018.
8.     
The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
9.     
The monthly rent as of the date of the hearing
is $1,780.00.
10.  
The Tenant has made no payments since the
application was filed.
11.  
The Landlords collected a rent deposit of
$1,750.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlords.
12.  
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenant for the period from November 1, 2016 to June 29, 2018.
13.  
I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
L2 application
14.  
It is uncontested that the Tenant has been
persistently late in paying her rent. 
15.  
I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. In particular, I
have considered that the Tenant testified that she does not wish for the
tenancy to continue and that it is very unlikely that she will be able to void
the arrears eviction order. 
It is ordered that:
 
Review:
16.  
The request to review is granted. Order CEL-77282-18
issued on August 10, 2018 is cancelled and replaced by the following order.
Regarding the L1 application:
17.  
Even if the Tenant voids the rent arrears
portion of this order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and
the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before September 25, 2018.
18.  
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords
$7,016.10*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to
September 14, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the
rent deposit.
19.  
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords
$58.52 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting September 15,
2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
20.  
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
21.  
If the unit is not vacated on or before September
25, 2018, then starting September 26, 2018, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
22.  
Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlords, on or after September 26, 2018.
23.  
If, on or before September 25, 2018, the Tenant
pays the amount of $9,920.00** to the Landlords or to the Board in trust, this rent
arrears portion of this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated due to non-payment of rent and the Tenant could
remain in the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
24.  
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside the rent arrears portion of this
order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after
September 26, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlords. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
Regarding the L2 application:
25.  
Even if the Tenant voids the eviction order for
arrears of rent above, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant is
still terminated due to persistent late payment of rent. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before September 25, 2018.
26.  
If the unit is not vacated on or before September
30, 2018 then starting October 1, 2018, the Landlords may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
27.  
Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlords on or after October 1, 2018.
