Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-08539-18
 










 
 
 

PPL.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict WG
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on October 9, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s Representative, F. D attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to
pay for the period from August 1, 2018 to October 31, 2018.  Because of the
arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 30, 2018.
2.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $98.78 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period
from May 1, 2018 to August 30, 2018.
4.     
The Tenant paid $1,000.00 after the application was filed.
5.     
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance
with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Landlord, upon receipt of this order, must give a copy of this
order to the Tenant  by a method set out in subsection 191 (1) of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, other than sending by mail or courier to the
last known address where the Tenant resides or carries on business. 
2.     
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of
the rental unit on or before October 26, 2018.
3.     
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,483.28*, which represents
the amount of rent owing and compensation up to October 15, 2018, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $39.46 per day for
compensation for the use of the unit starting October 16, 2018 to the date the
Tenant moves out of the unit.
5.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of
filing the application.
6.     
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on
or before October 26, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will
be simple interest calculated from October 27, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
7.     
If the unit is not vacated on or before October 26, 2018, then
starting October 27, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
October 27, 2018.
9.     
If, on or before October 26, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of
$1,551.25** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction
will be void.  This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the
Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on
time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
10.  
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that
subsection on or after October 27, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant
possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once
during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
