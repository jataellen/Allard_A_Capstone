J.W.F.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Q.B.
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. 
This is an L1 application.
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for the
purpose of residential occupation.  This is an L2 application.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on April 3, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
APPLICATION
FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.     The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from November 1, 2017 to April 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective March 14, 2018.
2.     The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,890.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
3.     Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from March 1, 2017 to
March 14, 2018.
APPLICATION
FOR LANDLORD’S OWN USE
4.      I
am satisfied the Landlord in good faith requires possession of the rental unit
for the purpose of residential occupation.
5.      The
Landlord stated that he is currently living in a rental unit and he no longer
wants to rent out his home.  The Landlord plans on living in the rental unit
with his son.  
6.      He
does not want to pay at another location while he has a place of his own he can
move into.  His current location has a parking issue he has to deal with as
well.
7.      The
Landlord bought the rental unit last year and entered into a one year lease
with the Tenant, which ended February 28, 2018.  He has given his notice to
vacate at his current location.
8.      Section
48.1 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) states a
landlord is obligated to compensate the tenant one month’s rent when the
landlord requires the rental unit for their own use.  Here, the Tenant has
failed to pay rent since November 2017; therefore, one month’s rent will be
waived in full satisfaction of section 48.1.
9.     I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
10.  This
order contains all of the reasons for my decision within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.  
It
is ordered that:
APPLICATION
FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.     Unless
the Tenant voids this portion of the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before April 15, 2018.
2.     The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,919.54*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to April 4, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $62.14 per day for compensation for the use
of the unit starting April 5, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.     The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.     If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before April
15, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from April 16, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 15, 2018, then starting April 16,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 16, 2018.
8.     If,
on or before April 15, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $9,640.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this portion of this order for eviction will
be void.  This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the
Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on
time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after April 16, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
APPLICATION
FOR LANDLORD’S OWN USE
10.   If
the Tenant voids the above portion of this order pursuant
to paragraph 8 or 9 then the following shall apply:
11.   The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated April 30, 2018.  The
Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before April 30, 2018.
12.   If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 30, 2018, then starting May 1, 2018,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
13.   Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 1, 2018.
