Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-80715-17
 










 
 
 

[Numbered
Company] (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict W.S. and M.L. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent
that the Tenants owe and have been persistently late in paying their rent; and
because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in
the residential complex have substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another
tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This
application was heard in Whitby on June 30, 2017.
 
Only
the Landlord attended
the hearing. The Landlord was represented by N.O..
 
Determinations:
THE
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from April 1, 2017 to June 30, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective May 17, 2017.
2.      The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending June 30, 2017 total $2,900.00. 
3.      The
Landlord incurred costs of $190.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
4.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,400.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from February 1,
2016 to May 17, 2017 in the amount of $27.50.
6.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
THE
APPLICATION ALLEGING PERSISTENT LATE PAYMENT AND SUBSTANTIAL INTERFERENCE
7.      At
the hearing, the Landlord requested the consent of the Board to withdraw this
part of the application.
8.      In
accordance with subsection 200(4) of the Act, I consented to the withdrawal.
It is
ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before July 16, 2017.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $1,710.79*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to July 5, 2017, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $46.03 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting July 6, 2017 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before July
16, 2017, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from July 17, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before July 16, 2017, then starting July 17,
2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 17, 2017.
8.      If,
on or before July 16, 2017, the Tenants pay the amount of $4,490.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after July 17, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period
of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
