Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-03632-18
 











 
 
 

CRSL On Behalf Of DC&SL (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict ED and WCL (the 'Tenants')
because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on November 26,
2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, JC, and the Tenant, WL,
attended the hearing. 
 
At the hearing, WL confirmed that he was there to
represent himself only and he was not representing the other named Tenant, ED. 
 
ED
failed to attend despite the Board serving a Notice of Hearing on all parties
that indicated the time, place and purpose of the hearing. There was no record before
me of a request to adjourn. In spite of this, I waited 30 minutes. When the
Tenant still failed to attend, I proceeded to determine the application on the
basis of the materials before me. 
Determinations:
 
The Tenants owe the Landlord $7,837.59
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from June 1,
2018 to November 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a
Notice of Termination effective September 20, 2018.
2.     
At the hearing, the Tenant
WL did not dispute that the Tenants owe the Landlord the amount claimed in the
application. At the time of the hearing, the amount owing was $5,997.59,
including arrears of rent to November 30, 2018 and the application filing fee.
Given that this order is being issued in December, it also includes the rent
for December, 2018 for a total amount owing of $7,837.59. If the Tenants have
made any payments toward the rent or the arrears since the hearing, they should
be deducted from the amount owing in this order.
3.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,840.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
4.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from June 1, 2018 to September 20, 2018.
The Tenants are jointly and severally liable for the
rent/arrears 
5.     
At the hearing, the parties
presented the following evidence: 
•       
The Tenants are both on the
lease. 
•       
WL testified that ED moved
out of the rental unit in June, 2018 and stopped paying his half of the rent.
WL testified that he has not found a new roommate and he is currently living in
the rental unit alone. WL testified that he would like to find someone else to
live with.
•       
The Landlord testified that
he never received notice that ED had vacated the unit. WL did not dispute this.
•       
ED has not entered into a
new lease with the Landlord since ED moved out.
6.     
Based on the parties’
evidence, I am satisfied that the Tenants remain jointly and severally liable
to the Landlord for the rent and arrears. First, I cannot find that ED has even
moved out. ED never provided the Landlord with notice of termination and he has
not returned his key to the Landlord. The Landlord has also not observed
first-hand that ED’s bedroom is empty. Second, the only lease in effect for the
rental unit is one in which both Tenants are named. WL has not signed a new
lease with the Landlord that names him as the only Tenant or that includes any
other tenant. Therefore, both Tenants remain jointly and severally liable to
the Landlord for the rent under that lease. Accordingly, ED remains a party to
this application and this order applies to him and WL. 
Section 83 considerations 
7.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. 
8.     
WL requested a payment plan
that would allow him to pay the arrears over time. He proposed paying the
Landlord $100.00/month towards the arrears in addition to his rent. However, I
find that this (or any) payment plan would not be appropriate in this
situation. WL testified that he does not know where ED is currently living.
Therefore, even though the Tenants are jointly responsible pay paying the
arrears, it may fall on WL to do so alone. WL testified that his monthly income
is $3,100.00 and his expenses are $1,000.00 in addition to the rent for a total
of $2,840.00. Even if I accept the Tenant’s testimony about his financial
situation without any documentation to corroborate it, I find that WL would
barely be able to make the $100.00 monthly payments he proposed. Further, based
on this payment plan, it would take WL (or the Tenants together) approximately
80 months to pay off the arrears. I do not think this is a fair or realistic
plan for either party. Therefore, I find that conditional relief is not
appropriate.
9.     
I am also not satisfied that
relief from eviction is appropriate because the evidence suggests that WL
cannot afford to pay the monthly rent. According to the application, which WL
did not dispute, he paid $700.00 towards the rent in October, 2018, which is
$20.00 short of half and he did not pay any rent in November, 2018. When WL was
asked why he did not pay rent in November he testified that he had additional
expenses that month, specifically winter clothes. Without any documentation
before me to corroborate WL’s income, I am left to find that either WL did not prioritize
his rent appropriately or the financial information he provided in his
testimony is incorrect. There was no evidence before me regarding ED’s
financial situation so I am unable to determine whether he can afford to pay
some or all of the rent. 
10.  
WL testified that if the
application was granted, he would need 1-3 months to move out. By the time this
order becomes enforceable, WL will have had a month to find alternative
accommodations. I do not think it is reasonable to continue the tenancy any
further and risk having the arrears continue to increase.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before December
28, 2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $5,685.41*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to December 17, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes
on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $60.49 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting December 18, 2018 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before December 28, 2018, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
December 29, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before December 28, 2018, then starting December 29, 2018, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after December 29, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before December
28, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $7,837.59** to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after December 29,
2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
