Tenancies Act, 2006

Review Order
 
CRSL On Behalf Of DC & SL (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict ED and William CL (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was resolved by order HOL-03632-18
issued on December 17, 2018.
 
On December 27, 2018, the Tenant,
WL requested a review of the order.
 
A preliminary review of the review
request was completed without a hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant, WL, requests a
review of the voidable order for termination of the tenancy on December 218,
2018, for non-payment of rent.  
 
2.     
The request for review says
that the Tenant was not able to participate because of a mental health
condition which caused him anxiety in the hearing room and that he needs more
time to find alternate housing.  
 
3.     
On the basis of the
submissions made in the request, I am not satisfied that there is a serious
error in the order or that a serious error occurred in the proceedings.
 
4.     
The Tenant states in the
review that he suffers from a bi-polar disorder but has provided no medical
evidence of a disability with his review.  
 
5.     
I have listened to the
hearing recording in its entirety.  The Tenant asked for no accommodation in
the hearing, and did not speak to any health or mental health issues when he
was asked directly by the Member if there were any circumstances which she
should consider to determine whether to delay or deny eviction. The Tenant
fully participated in the hearing and was able to ask and answer questions.
When the Tenant was asked how long he would need to find another place, he said
a month to 90 days. 
 
6.     
Section 83(1) of the Act
requires that consideration be made of the impact of eviction or refusal or delay
of eviction on both the Tenant and the Landlord.  In this case, the Tenant owes
significant arrears and made no rent payment at all in the month of the
hearing. The Member considered the circumstances and determined that the
prejudice to the Landlord of the increasing arrears, the unsustainable
circumstances of the tenancy, and the Tenant’s intention to leave the unit made
it unfair to grant relief from eviction.  There is nothing in the request for
review or on the record to indicate that the Member exercised her discretion
not to award the Tenant relief from eviction in an unreasonable manner.  
7.      The Board has published Guideline # 8 entitled “Review of an Order”.
It is not binding on me but I find it informative and useful and choose to
follow it. It states:
          “The Board will not interfere with the proper exercise of
discretion by a Member.        Discretion refers to decisions such as whether
relief from eviction should be granted     (see section 83) or what remedies
should be ordered in a particular case. The   reviewing Member should not
interfere with the decision even if they may have           exercised the
discretion in a somewhat different way. 
8.     
On the basis of the
circumstances of the hearing, and considering the reasonable exercise of
discretion of the Member, I find that there was no serious error in the
proceedings and the Tenant was reasonably able to participate in the hearing.
 
9.     
The review request is
dismissed in accordance with Rule 29.11(c) of the Board’s Rules of Practice
because the grounds for considering a review are not satisfied.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The request to review order
HOL-03632-18 issued on December 17, 2018 is denied. The order is confirmed and
remains unchanged.
