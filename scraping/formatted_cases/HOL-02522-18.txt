Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-02522-18
 










 
 

QM
(estate Of) and HL (trustee Per Will) (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict QZ (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Newmarket on April 23, 2018.
 
The Landlord, HL, the Landlord’s representative, RWY, the Tenant
and the Tenant’s representative, RZ, attended the hearing.
 
At the outset of the hearing the Tenant’s representative requested
a stay or adjournment of this application because the Tenant has made a Claim
in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in which he claims an ownership
interest in the rental unit. 
 
The parties agree that title to the rental unit is in the
Landlords’ name and has been since before the lease between the parties was
entered into. 
 
The parties also agree that the Tenant and QM entered into a
written residential lease agreement on May 10, 2015. QM died after this
agreement was entered into and HL, her daughter, is the Trustee of her estate.
 
A Landlord and Tenant relationship has therefore been
demonstrated. The Landlord and Tenant Board has jurisdiction to deal with
landlord and tenant issues. The issue to be determined by this application is
whether there are arrears of rent as alleged by the Landlords and what remedy
should be granted if arrears are found to be owing.
 
This application to the Board was filed on March 7, 2018. The
Superior Court claim by the Tenant was filed on April 3, 2018. The alleged
arrears of rent exceed $25,000.00 which is the monetary jurisdiction of the
Board. The Landlord has agreed to waive the excess over $25, 000.00. 
 
According to the Tenant’s own representative, the allegations of
the Tenant relating to his alleged ownership interest are difficult and complex
issues, and it may take a considerable length of time before those issues can
be dealt with by the Superior Court.
 
It would be unfair and unreasonable to stay or adjourn this matter
for an undetermined length of time while the Tenant continues to occupy the
rental unit without paying rent.
 
I declined to grant the adjournment.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant and QM entered into a tenancy agreement on May 10, 2015 for the rental
unit. The term of the lease was for one year commencing May 10, 2015. The
monthly rent is $4,420.00. The Tenant has resided in the rental unit since May
10, 2015. 
 
2.      According
to the Tenant he owned the rental unit prior to May 2015, and resided in it as
the owner. He transferred title to QM sometime prior to May 10, 2015 and
entered into the tenancy agreement, pursuant to which he continued to live in
the unit.
 
3.      The
Tenant produced photocopies of a number of cheques and money orders dated
between April 2015 and February 2017, payable to HL, which he alleged were all
made in payment of the rent for the rental unit. These cheques/money orders
total $194,000.00 and are as follows:
 
a)    $9,000.00
           (date unclear but appears to be in 2015)
b)    $50,000.00          April
2015 (day unclear)
c)    $60,000.00          (date
unclear but appears to be July 2016)
d)    $30,000.00
         July 7, 2016
e)    $35,000.00          August
2016 (processed on August 26, 2016)
f)     $10,000.00          February
1, 2017 
 
4.      HL
denies that these payments were made for rent. She produced a Promissory Note
from the Tenant to her dated August 10, 2014 in the amount of $650,000.00. She
gave evidence that the payments of $194,000.00 were made in partial payment of
that promissory note.
 
5.      I
find that the payments totalling $194,000.00 were not made in respect of rent
for the rental unit, but were made for some other purpose. I make this finding
for the following reasons:
 
a)    By
February 1, 2017 (the date of the last payment) the total amount of rent for
the period May 10, 2015 until February 9, 2017 was $92,820.00 (21 months at
$4,420.00 per month). I consider it unlikely that the Tenant would have
overpaid the rent by over $100,000.00 by February 1, 2017.
 
b)    In
a similar vein, the total amount of rent due for the 3 year period from May 10,
2015 until May 9, 2018 is $159,120.00 (36 months at $4,420.00 per month). I
consider it unlikely that the large lump sum payments were intended for the
pre-payment of rent for almost a 2 year period which will not end until
December 2018 or January 2019.
 
c)    For
the months of June 2015, July 2015, and August 2015 the Tenant paid rent of
$4,420.00 to QM as required by the rental agreement. This is in addition to the
$4,420.00 payment for May 2015 which is acknowledged in the rental agreement. These
payments are inconsistent with the Tenant’s assertion that he made a lump sum
payment for rent in April 2015 to HL (not her mother QM who was alive at the
time and was the Landlord) in the amount of $50,000.00.  
 
d)    The
Tenant gave a series of post dated cheques in the amount of $4,420.00 each,
made payable to QM for each of the months of November 2015, December 2015,
January 2016, February 2016, March 2016 and April 2016. These cheques were not
cashed as there were not sufficient funds in the account to cover them.
Tendering these cheques is inconsistent with the Tenant’s allegation that
before the end of 2015 he had paid lump sums for rent totalling $59,000.00 as
well as monthly payments for May 2015 to August 2015 totalling $17,680.00.
 
6.      It
is apparent that the parties have had financial dealings other than the lease
of the rental unit. Those dealings are not the subject matter of this
application and will be dealt with in the context of the Superior Court action.
 
7.      Based
on the evidence, I find that the Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period from June 10, 2017 to May 9, 2018.  Because
of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination.
 
8.      The
arrears of rent exceed the Board’s monetary jurisdiction of $25,000.00. The
Landlords have elected to waive all arrears of rent up to the date of this
hearing which exceed $25,000.00. I explained to the parties the effect of
waiving the excess of arrears.
 
9.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before May 8, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $25,000.00*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to May 8, 2018.
 
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $145.32 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting May 9, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before May
8, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from May 9, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before May 8, 2018, then starting May 9, 2018,
the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after May 9, 2018.
 
8.      If,
on or before May 8, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $25,175.00** to the
Landlords or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
 
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after May 9, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlords. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
