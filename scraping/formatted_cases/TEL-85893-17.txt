Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-85893-17
 










 
 
 

U.K.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict R.B.(the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
At
the hearing the Tenants applied pursuant to section 82 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order determining that the Landlord or
the Landlord's superintendent or the Landlord's agent substantially interfered
with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the
Tenant or by a member of the Tenant's household, and an order determining that
the Landlord failed to meet the Landlord's maintenance obligations under the Act
or failed to comply with health, safety, housing or maintenance standards.
 
This
application was heard in Whitby on December 15, 2017 and January 31, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
1.     At
the initial hearing the Board issued an interim order directing the Tenant to
pay the rent for January, 2018 to the Landlord on or before January 10, 2018. 
The Tenant did not comply with this order.
APPLICATION
FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
2.     The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from October 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October 20, 2017.
3.     The
Tenant stated he paid the Landlord’s neighbour $500.00 on October 14, 2017.  The
Tenant did not document the payment and the neighbour was not in attendance as
a witness.  The Tenant also failed to provide sufficient evidence regarding the
withdrawal of the amount from his bank account.  I am not satisfied this
payment was made.
4.     The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,000.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
5.     Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from August 1, 2017
to October 20, 2017.
APPLICATION
UNDER SECTION 82
6.     The
Tenant brought the following issues forward under section 82:
a)    Noise
and harassment from upstairs tenant;
b)    Leak
and mould in the kitchen;
c)    Issue
with heating;
d)    Broken
door lock; and
e)    Inspection
order from O. F. S.
Noise from
Upstairs Tenant
7.     The
Tenant submitted text messages to the Landlord from both the Tenant and the
Tenant’s significant other, P.  The messages begin September 17, 2017 to the
Landlord regarding the noise and disturbances from the upstairs tenant.  
8.     The
Landlord claims she did not receive the messages dated September 17, October
20, 27, 28, and November 9, 2017.  
9.     If
the Landlord had missed text messages from one party only it would be
reasonable to understand; however, the Landlord is claiming she did not receive
any messages from both the Tenant and his significant other for some time.  At
the hearing, it was confirmed that the Tenant has the correct phone number for
the Landlord.  On a balance of probabilities I am not satisfied the text
messages were not received.
10.  The
Tenant further states that the Landlord did not respond to many of the text
messages.  The Landlord did not respond back to the message sent December 1,
2017, yet the Landlord issued a Notice of Termination to the upstairs tenant
regarding the noise complaint in the basement.  
11.  The
Landlord further states that the upstairs tenant is vacating the rental unit in
March 2018.
Leak and
Mould
12.  The
Tenant and his significant other sent text messages to the Landlord about a
leak that was coming through the ceiling into the Tenant’s kitchen.  The first
text was October 27, 2017 followed up with texts on October 28 and November 9,
2017.  The Landlord then responded to both the Tenant and his significant other
on November 22, 2017 stating a man will be attending the unit to address the
water leak.  
13.  The
Tenant submitted a picture of the water damage done to the wall in the
kitchen.  It shows severe bubbling and peeling of the paint.  The drywall tape
also seems to be lifting due to the moisture.  The Tenant further states the
moisture has caused mould in the kitchen.  
14.  The leak
was fixed on January 16, 2018 according to the Tenant.  
15.  The
Landlord says the leak was fixed December 10, 2017 and provided a copy of an
invoice dated December 11, 2017.  The Landlord submitted a copy of an invoice
dated January 9, 2018, which claims the same work was completed at that time.  Both
invoices have duplicate grammar mistakes.  The first invoice shows an invoice
number of 1 and the second invoice shows an invoice number of 808.  
16.  The
Landlord states the reason it was not fixed sooner was because the Tenant was
not around to allow the repair person into the rental unit.  The problem with
this is that it is not the Tenant’s responsibility to let the Landlord’s agents
in to perform maintenance and/or repairs.  It is the Landlord’s obligation to
take the necessary steps to ensure maintenance and/or repairs are completed in
a timely and effective manner.
Issue
with Heating
17.  The issue
with the lack of heat seems to stem from the tenant upstairs.  The Tenant’s
complaints regarding the heat are due to the upstairs tenant turning the heat
off or keeping it on extremely high.  
18.  When the
heat was extremely high on November 29, 2017 the Tenant sent a text to the
Landlord.  The Tenant had no recourse to lower the heat by opening windows
because the windows were screwed shut.  The Landlord states she will fix the
windows so they can be opened properly.
19.  In the
text messages submitted, the Landlord states she cannot speak with the upstairs
tenant because no one is answering the phone.  The Tenant responded by telling
her there is someone in the unit because the Tenant can hear them.  
20.  On
January 2, 2018 the Tenant called Bylaw due to the heat and someone from the
City of Oshawa (‘City’) took the temperature.  They also directed the Landlord
to fix the issue.  On January 3, 2018 the City called the Tenant to check on
the status of the heat.  Since there was no work completed by the Landlord so
the City called the Landlord again.  
21.  An
electrician attended the rental unit on January 5, 2018 and found the
thermostat located in the upstairs tenant’s rental unit, ripped off of the
wall.  The Tenant submitted a picture of the thermostat.
22.  The
Landlord relocated the thermostat in the common area of the house where the
Tenant and the upstairs tenant can access it and the Tenant states the upstairs
tenant now turns the furnace off when the Tenant leaves his unit.
23.  The issue
with the upstairs tenant continues to the date of the hearing based on the
Tenant’s testimony.  The Tenant has also mitigated the situation by buying
space heaters for the unit.
Broken
Door Lock
24.  The door
separating the Tenant’s rental unit to the common area does not lock properly. 
The Tenant wants a lock on his rental unit door.
25.  The
Landlord states the lock can be fixed to allow the Tenant security.
Inspection
order from O. F. S. 
26.  The
Tenant states the rental unit does not comply with the City’s requirements to
show it is a two unit dwelling as opposed to a single family dwelling.  He
provided a copy of the Inspection Order (‘Order’) which states the rental unit
is not in compliance with the Oshawa Fire Services.
27.  The O.
F. S requires the Landlord to comply with the Report or file an appeal of
the Order. The Landlord states she is appealing the process and she has begun
the process to have the house deemed a two unit dwelling.  The Landlord
submitted a copy of her application to the City.
28.  Tenant
states he did not know of the issues the Fire Department brought forward. 
While it is clear the Landlord is not in compliance with City’s requirements unless
it has some impact on the Tenant, it is irrelevant to the situation.  Here, the
Tenant led insufficient evidence that this knowledge has impacted him in any
way.  
29.  Given all
of the above, I am satisfied the Landlord substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenant or
by a member of the Tenant's household, and the Landlord failed to meet the
Landlord's maintenance obligations under the Act or failed to comply with
health, safety, housing or maintenance standards.
Remedies
30.  The
Tenant requests remedy in the amount of 50% abatement of rent from the date the
issues began and continue the abatement until everything is fixed.  Based on
the evidence before the Board and my knowledge of previous like applications, I
find this to be an unreasonably high abatement of rent.  
31.  The
Tenant notified the Landlord of the concerns with the upstairs tenant on
September 17, 2017.  The Tenant notified the Landlord of the leak on October
27, 2017.  The temperature situation began November 29, 2017 and the Tenant
sent a text to the Landlord about it that day.  The temperature issue was
somewhat sporadic where the Tenant had heat, had no heat, and had too much
heat.  
32.  To allot
the same abatement from September 17, 2017 to the date of the hearing would be
unreasonable.  For this reason the abatement will increase as the issues
accumulated.  For the period of September 17, 2017 to October 26, 2017 an
abatement of 10% is granted for the unaddressed noise and disturbance from the
upstairs tenant.  
33.  From
October 27, 2017 to November 28, 2017 an abatement of 25% is granted for the
continued situation with the upstairs tenant and the lack of repair to the leak
and moisture.  
34.  From
November 29, 2017 to January 16, 2017 an abatement of 35% is granted for the
intermittent temperature issues that were not addressed, the concerns pertaining
to the upstairs tenant, and the leak.  
35.  As of
January 17, 2018 to the date of the hearing the abatement will be reduced to
20%.
36.  The total
abatement granted to the date of the hearing is $1,056.99.
37.  The
Tenant also requests reimbursement of a baker’s table at $50.00 and a space
heater at $248.00.  The Tenant provided no receipts for these items; however,
the Board may grant a reasonable cost.  In this case, I believe a reasonable
cost for both items is $100.00.
38.  Lastly,
the Tenant requested the issues be fixed.  This remedy is granted.
39.  The
Tenant requested a repayment plan of the arrears of $200.00 a month until it is
paid off.  That would mean a repayment plan that would last for 6 months.  The
Tenant also stated that it is difficult to find a new location, but did not
provide further explanation as to why a repayment plan is required.  
40.  The
Landlord stated she wanted an order for termination of the tenancy immediately.
41.  I believe
the Tenant’s proposed repayment plan is unreasonable.  Since the Tenant gave no
other alternative an order with standard terms shall issue.
42.  I have
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1)
of the Act.
43.  This
order contains all of the reasons for my decision within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.  
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The
Landlord shall fix the windows and lock on the Tenant’s door on or before March
26, 2018.
2.     Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before March 26, 2018.
3.     The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $3,297.69*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to March 15, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit and less the amount of the
abatement the Landlord owes the Tenant.
4.     The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $32.88 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting March 16, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
5.     The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
6.     If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March
26, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from March 27, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
7.     If
the unit is not vacated on or before March 26, 2018, then starting March 27,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 27, 2018.
9.     If,
on or before March 26, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $5,018.01** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
10.  The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after March 27, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
