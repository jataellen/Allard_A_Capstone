Order under Sections 69
and 89
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-94597-18
 











 
 
 

A. A. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict A. T. and C. T. (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe and because the Tenants have
been persistently late in paying their rent. The Landlord also claimed
administration charges related to NSF cheques.
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenants because they, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have wilfully or
negligently caused undue damage to the premises and because the number of
persons living in the unit on a continuing basis is more than permitted by
health, safety or housing standards. The Landlord also claimed compensation for
each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on November 22,
2018.
 
Only the Landlord and the
Landlord’s representative, P. M., attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
THE APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF
RENT
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent they were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2018 to
November 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective August 22, 2018.
2.     
The outstanding arrears
owing for the period ending November 30, 2018, total $8,140.00. 
3.     
The Landlord paid $190.00
for the costs of filing the application and the Landlord is entitled to be reimbursed
for those costs. 
4.     
The Landlord incurred
charges of $180.00 for administration charges related to cheques tendered by or
on behalf of the Tenants, which were returned NSF.
5.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,800.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from July 11, 2011 to August 22, 2018,
in the amount of $243.51. 
7.     
The Tenants paid $170.00
after the application was filed.
8.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
THE
APPLICATION FOR PERSISTENTLY LATE PAYMENT
9.     
At the hearing, the Landlord
requested the consent of the Board to withdraw their application.
10.  
In accordance with
subsection 200(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’), I
consent to the withdrawal of the application.  
THE
APPLICATION FOR WILFUL OR NEGLIGENT DAMAGE
11.   The Landlord served the Tenants with a notice of
termination which says that the Tenants wilfully or negligently caused undue
damage to the rental unit contrary to subsection 62(1) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). The Landlord is also seeking monetary
compensation for the alleged damage pursuant to section 89 of the Act. 
12.  
As I pointed out at the
hearing, the notice of termination and the claim for compensation do not
contain specific dates, times or details regarding the Tenants’ alleged
behaviour. 
13.  
The notice of termination
fails to comply with subsection 43(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act') which says that a notice of termination given by a landlord to a
tenant must set out the reasons and details for the notice.
14.  
In addition, the Divisional
Court’s decision in Ball v. Metro Capital Property, [2002] O.J. No. 5931
stands for the proposition that the kinds of particulars that should be
contained in a notice which is about a tenant’s behaviour should include “dates
and times of the alleged offensive conduct together with a detailed description
of the alleged conduct engaged in by the tenant”. As I explained to the
Landlord, the notice here does not meet this requirement.
15.  
I also explained that the
Tenants have the right to know the allegations before the hearing so they can
be prepared to defend the application. For these reasons, I find that the
notice of termination served on the Tenant pursuant to s. 62 of the Act fails
to meet the mandatory requirements of the Act. The Landlord’s application based
on subsection 62(1) of the Act and section 89 of the Act must therefore be
dismissed.
THE
APPLICATION FOR OVERCROWDING
16.  
Subsection 67(1) of the Act
says “a landlord may give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy if the
number of persons occupying the rental unit on a continuing basis results in a
contravention of health, safety or housing standards required by law.”
17.  
The Landlord served the
Tenants with a notice of termination which alleges that there are six children
living in the rental unit. At the hearing, the Landlord’s representative was
unable to provide the Board with any by-law which prohibits the Tenants from
having six children living in the rental unit. 
18.  
Based on the evidence before
me, I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the Tenants have
breached subsection 67(1) of the Act. This portion of the Landlord’s
application is dismissed. 
It is ordered that:
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before December
22, 2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $7,034.28*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to December 11, 2018 and the total charges related to {a} NSF cheque{s} tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenants, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $66.90 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting December 12, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before December 22, 2018, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
December 23, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before December 22, 2018, then starting December 23, 2018, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after December 23, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before December
22, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $10,545.00** to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection
74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under
that subsection on or after December 23, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this
motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
