under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006

J H T S (the 'Landlord') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict D S and M S (the 'Tenants') because
they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the
residential complex have substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the
unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on
July 15, 2019.
 
The Landlord’s Legal
Representative Q L Y, the Landlord, the Tenant and the Tenant’s Legal Representative,
D E attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 

The Landlord filed an application seeking a finding that
     by failing to pay municipal services and other utilities, the Tenant has
     substantially interfered with another lawful right, privilege or interest
     of the Landlord by failing to pay a utility the Tenant was required to pay.

 

The parties agree that the Tenant has not paid the water
     bill since the commencement of the Tenancy and the Tenant was obliged to
     do so. 

 

On or about February 11, 2019 the Landlord discovered that
     his mortgage provider had paid the sum of $4756.16 to the City of Toronto
     for an unpaid water bill from September 2018.  

 
Landlord’s evidence:
 

The Landlord testified that once he was alerted to the
     issue, he investigated the issue with the City he was told that charge was
     valid and was the direct result of spike in consumption between May and
     August 2018.

 

The landlord testified that despite this he went to the
     City office to dispute the water charge and the City once again explained
     that based on their records, the increase is likely due to excessive water
     use in the rental unit and the City’s perspective is that increase is
     based entirely on consumption over the summer.  

 

The City disputed the Landlord’s suggestion that the water
     metre was at fault because the spike is limited to two months over the
     summer, therefore it was unlikely that the spike was the result of faulty
     metre reading or a metre defect because the spike would have continued
     into the fall, but it did not.  

 

The Landlord escalated the issue within the City to the
     City Revenue Office, but he was given the same explanation and his
     complaint was deemed resolved.

 

The Landlord’s mortgage provider has paid the entire water
     bill with his property taxes.

 

The Landlord submitted invoices from the City for water
     consumption which date from February 13, 2017 to February 11, 2019 and
     total $6839.18.   

 
Tenant’s evidence:
 

The Tenant agrees that he is responsible for paying
     utilities and had not paid the amount claimed for the following reasons:

 
(a)  The Landlord did not provide
the Tenant with an invoice to pay until after it was paid;
(b)  The Tenant felt that
Landlord had not done enough to investigate the spike in water consumption. 
(c)  The Tenant explained that
neither he nor any other member of his family were present in the rental unit
during the summer of 2018 and therefore they are not responsible for the spike
in water usage.  
Findings:
 

Based on the evidence of the parties, I am satisfied that
     the Landlord has met the evidentiary burden required to establish that
     Tenant was liable to pay for the water usage in the rental unit over the
     summer of 2018.  I am also satisfied that that the Tenant did not do so
     and his failure to do so substantially interfered with lawful right,
     privilege or interest of the Landlord and resulted water bill being added
     to the Landlord’s municipal tax bill. 

 

A Tenant, while in possession is obliged pursuant to s. 34
     of the Act to ensure that his use of the rental unit does not interfere
     with the Landlord’s lawful right or interest and to ensure that proper
     steps were taken to safeguard the property from misuse by unknown third
     parties.

 

The Tenant was encouraged to pay a portion of the amount
     claimed to the Landlord as good faith gesture and the Tenant paid $2075.30
     to the Landlord after the hearing date.  The balance of $4755.89 is owed
     to the Landlord.

  
14. An application to terminate a tenancy
for unpaid utilities is made pursuant to s. 69 of the Act.  That section allows
for termination only and does not allow for an order for unpaid utilities. 
 
15. Any unpaid money becomes a debt owed
to landlord by the Tenant.  In this case the tenant is alleged to owe $6831.19
which represents a water bills paid by the Landlord from February 2017 to
February 2019. I am satisfied that the Tenant owes the Landlord this sum of money.
There is discretion under s. 83 to grant relief from eviction.  
 
16. The Landlord’s representative states
that the Tenant has taken advantage of the situation with the Municipality and
should be held accountable for not paying for the water when he knew he was
required to do so. 
 
17. The Tenancy is more than 7 years in
length.  There are no arrears of rent and except for incident early in the
tenancy, the Tenant has paid all amounts he was required to pay.  
 

I have considered all
     of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
     Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including the Landlord’s own failure
     to follow up regarding the water bills prior to February 2019 and the
     Tenant’s voluntary payment after the hearing and find that it would not be
     unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in
     this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. 

 
It is ordered that:
 

The Landlord’s application to terminate the Tenancy and
     evict the Tenant is denied on the condition that:

 
(a)  On of before October 15, 2019 the Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4755.89, which represents the unpaid portion of the water bill to March 31,
2019.
2.    If the Tenant fails to make any of the payments in accordance with
paragraph 2, and by the dates required, then:
a.       
The Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenant, and for the payment of any new arrears of rent and NSF
charges not already ordered under paragraph 1 of this order. The Landlord must
make the application within 30 days of a breach of a condition set out in
paragraph 2 of this order. 
b.       
The balance owing under paragraph 1 of this
order shall become payable on the day following the date of default. The monies
owing shall bear interest at the post-judgment interest rate determined under
subsection 207(7) of the Act.

The Tenants shall
     also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.

 
4.   
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing on or before September 16, 2019, they will start
to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from September 17,
2019 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
