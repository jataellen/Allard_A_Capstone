Landlord’s L1 application.
T.N.G.I.G.I. (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict J.S. and C.W. (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
Landlord’s L2 application.
T.N.G.I.G.I. (the 'Landlord')
also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict J.S. and C.W. (the
'Tenants') because they have been persistently late in paying their rent. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the
unit after the termination date.
 
These applications were heard
in Belleville on May 10, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord’s agent L.C.
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
With respect to the
Landlord’s L1 application, the
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from March 1, 2018 to May 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective March 16, 2018.
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $920.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from April 1, 2014 to March 16, 2018.
4.     
The Tenants paid $960.00
after the application was filed.
5.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
6.     
With respect to the
Landlord’s L2 application, the
Tenants have persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
7.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before May 27,
2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $487.30*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to May 16, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $31.56 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting May 17, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May 27, 2018, the Tenants will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from May 28,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before May 27, 2018, then starting May 28, 2018, the Landlord may file this
order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 28, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before May 27,
2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $2,110.00** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after May 28, 2018
but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
10.   If the tenants void this order as per paragraph
# 8 or # 9, then the Tenants will pay to the Landlord the monthly rent when it
comes due on the first day of each month starting on June 1, 2018 and
continuing until May 1, 2019 inclusive.
11.   Failure to do as directed in paragraph # 10 will
allow the Landlord to apply to the board under Section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act (2006), without notice to the Tenants, for an order
terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants. The Landlord must make this
application no later than 30 days after the Tenant’s failure to make a payment.
As part of this application, the Landlord can also request an order for
arrears, damages, NSF cheque fees and related administrative charges and the
cost of filing the application.
