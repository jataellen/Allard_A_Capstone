Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-01347-17
 










 
 
 

D.C.R.I.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict S.H.
and F.H. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe. The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges and related
administration charges.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on May 17, 2017.
 
The
Landlord and the Tenants attended the hearing. The Landlord was represented by
its agent, S.V..
 
Determinations:
 
1.      At
the beginning of the hearing a number of preliminary issues were raised. 
THE
PRELIMINARY ISSUES
2.      After
hearing the evidence and submissions of the parties, I have removed a third
named respondent from the application as she is a guarantor under the tenancy
agreement and not a tenant. 
3.      I
say this because, although this person was named as a tenant on the original
lease, the lease also indicates there was no intention on the part of the
parties that she actually live in the rental unit. The Tenants and their minor
children are named as occupants but this third named respondent is not.
Further, there was e-mail correspondence from the Landlord at the time the
parties where negotiating the tenancy agreement that clearly identifies her as
a guarantor. 
4.      Pursuant
to subsection 2(1) a “tenant” is a person who pays rent in return for the right
to occupy a rental unit. A guarantor does not meet this definition and the
Board has no jurisdiction with respect to guarantors. 
5.      The
second issue that arose at the hearing is the second named Tenant above claims
to have terminated her tenancy by serving a notice to terminate in Form N15 on
the Landlord. Pursuant to s. 47.2(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act') a joint tenant may terminate his or her interest in a tenancy by
giving notice of termination to the landlord if the tenant is deemed under
subsection 47.3 (1) to have experienced violence or another form of abuse.
Here, the Tenant’s N15 failed to meet the mandatory requirements of the Act. 
6.      Pursuant
to s. 47.2(3) such a notice must be given to the Landlord at least 28 days
before the date of termination specified on the face of the notice. Here, the
Tenant back-dated her notice meaning she delivered it to the Landlord after the
date of termination on it. So it is not valid and the second named Tenant has
not severed the joint tenancy agreement that is the subject of this
application. 
7.      The
second named Tenant also argues she is no longer a tenant because she moved
out. Section 47.2 would be meaningless if any tenant could simply sever a joint
tenancy by the unilateral act of moving out. Rather, what she is trying to
argue is that she is no longer in possession so the Board has lost jurisdiction
over her. 
8.      The
concept of being in possession is fact based. If a tenant moves out, severs all
connection to a unit, no longer has any control over the comings and goings in
that unit and sufficient time has passed, the Board may well make a finding
that a tenant is no longer in possession. 
9.      That
is not what has happened here. The Tenants have experienced marital breakdown
and separated. The second named Tenant appears to be staying with family, her
children still live in the unit, and she is still paying some of the bills
associated with the unit. More importantly perhaps, there is no separation
agreement between the parties so there has been no legal disposition of the
matrimonial home. 
10.   Given
the fact situation here both Tenants remain in possession of the rental unit
within the meaning of the Act.
THE
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
11.   There
is no dispute that the Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required
to pay for the period from March 1, 2017 to May 31, 2017.  Because of the
arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective March 25, 2017.
12.   The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending May 31, 2017 total $4,710.00.
13.   The
Landlord incurred charges of $45.00 for cheques tendered by or on behalf of the
Tenants, which were returned NSF and $60.00 for related administration charges.
14.   The
Landlord incurred costs of $175.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
15.   The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,500.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
16.   Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from August 1, 2016
to March 25, 2017 totalling $14.60.
RELIEF
FROM EVICTION
17.   The
real issue here is the question of relief from eviction. No surprisingly, the
Tenants take opposing positions with respect to relief. The first named Tenant
wishes to remain in the unit at least until the children are finished the
school year. The second named Tenant wants no relief at all because she wants
her liability for the rent to end immediately. The Landlord opposes relief because
the second named Tenant appears to have no intention of paying rent as she
formally did, and the first named Tenant appears to have no capacity to pay.
18.   Having
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Act, I find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction
until June 30, 2017 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. I say this for
the following reasons. 
19.   What
is happening here is an unfortunate development for everyone concerned. The
Tenants have two young children about 7 and 8 years old. The arrangement
between the Tenants prior to marital breakdown was that the second named Tenant
would be the primary earner while the first named Tenant attended school. 
20.   When
the Tenants separated the second named Tenant stopped paying rent; the first
named Tenant only discovered that fairly recently. 
21.   He
has a part-time job that pays a nominal amount only and no current capacity to
pay rent. He has just finished his schooling so could obtain work but he says that
when his spouse left she took with him all of his government identification. As
an immigrant it is difficult if not impossible to obtain work without proof of
permanent residency. He says he has an immigration lawyer helping him obtain
replacement identification but he cannot say how long that will take or how
long he might expect to continue to be unemployed. 
22.   Unfortunately
the Tenants have not negotiated a separation agreement with respect to the
obvious support issues that arise here.
23.   The
first named Tenant wishes to remain in the unit but if he has to move because
of lack of income he wants to be able to stay until the end of the children’s
school year. They continue to live in the rental unit and attend school close
by. But the child tax credit has not yet been redirected to him. 
24.   The
first named Tenant says his church has been very supportive and they are trying
to find the family somewhere else to stay or help out with the rent but nothing
has come of that yet. He has $200.00 in his bank account and his family is not
in a position to financially assist him.
25.   The
Landlord’s agent says the unit is a condominium unit owned by a private
individual or individuals who are not named as the Landlord in this
application. The mortgage is on the verge of going into default and the Tenants
have also defaulted on the utilities due under the tenancy agreement. 
26.   Although
I understand why both the Landlord and the second named Tenant seek speedy
termination of the tenancy, it seems to me that granting the standard 11 day
eviction order requested by the Landlord will render the first named Tenant and
two young children homeless just before the end of the school year. That is a
hardship that outweighs the financial concerns of the others involved here.
That being said, and to try and eliminate some of the prejudice to the
Landlord, an order will issue permitting the Landlord to file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) immediately. The Landlord’s agent says
such an order will not speed up eviction if the Tenants fail to return vacant
possession to the Landlord on or before June 30, 2017. It seems to me that is
up to the Sheriff’s office, but an order will also issue directing the Sheriff
to expedite enforcement once June 30, 2017 passes. 
27.   This
order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further
reasons shall be issued.
It
is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless
the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before June 30, 2017.
2.     The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $2,926.39*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to May 23, 2017 and the total charges related to
NSF cheques tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenants, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $51.62 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting May 24, 2017 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.     If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 3,
2017, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from June 4, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     If
the unit is not vacated on or before June 30, 2017, then starting July 1, 2017,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 1, 2017.
8.     If
the Tenants wish to void this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)       $4,990.00 if the payment is made on or before May 31, 2017, or
ii)      $6,560.00 if the payment is made on or before June 30, 2017**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after July 1, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
