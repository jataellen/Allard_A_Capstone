Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-77598-18
 










 
 

Y.C
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict A.M
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes
(“the L1 application”).
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying his rent (“the
L2 application”).
 
The
applications were heard in Toronto on November 2, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s legal representative, M.O (“MO”) and the Tenant
(who was self-represented) attended the hearing.
 
Preliminary Issues:
 
Request for Adjournment by the Tenant
 
1.   
The Tenant requested an adjournment.   This adjournment was
denied.   When the matter was last before the Board in August, the hearing was
adjourned and marked peremptory on the Tenant.   The Tenant has not provided
sufficient reasons to grant an adjournment of the hearing under the present
circumstances.
 
Motion by MO –Breach of interim Order
 
2.   
MO, on behalf of the Landlord, indicated that the Tenant had
failed to comply with the interim order of the Board issued by Member Lee on
August 24, 2018, by paying rent into the Board pending this hearing and
providing disclosure to the Landlord.  As such, he made a motion to deny the
Tenant the opportunity to present evidence and submissions at the hearing.
 
3.   
While the Tenant did not deny his failure to comply with the terms
of the interim order, given the seriousness of the consequences to the Tenant
of these proceedings, I permitted the Tenant to present evidence and
submissions at the hearing.
 
Motion by Tenant to Dismiss – Failure to Serve Notices
 
4.   
The Tenant moved to dismiss the applications on the basis that he
had neither been served with the N4 Notice of Termination nor the N8 Notice of
Termination.
 
5.    MO
confirmed orally at the hearing the information provided in his certificates of
service filed prior to the hearing with the Board: he personally served the
Tenant with both the Notices of Termination and that there was no reasonable
grounds to dismiss the applications on this basis.
 
6.    Further,
MO noted, this matter was scheduled for hearing in August and it was adjourned
at the Tenant’s request.  The Tenant did not raise any issue at that hearing
concerning an alleged lack of receipt of the Notices of Termination nor did the
Member indicate that there was any issue in this regard.
 
7.   
Based upon all the information available on file and at the
evidence provided at the hearing, including MO’s assertions that he served the
Tenant with the Notices, I am persuaded that the Tenant was properly served
with the Notices of Termination.  I am not convinced, on a balance of probabilities
by the Tenant’s assertions that he did not get the Notices of Termination.
 
Motion by the Tenant to Dismiss –Last Month Rent Deposit
 
8.   
The Tenant moved to dismiss the application – or convert it to an
L9 application –based upon the Landlord’s indication in the L1 application that
there was no LMR on file.
 
9.    MO
confirmed at the hearing that there is no last month’s rent deposit on file
with the Landlord.   MO described that the Landlord applied the LMR to the rent
during March 2017 and therefore, such funds were no longer there. 
 
10.
As I indicated at the hearing, I do not see the absence of a last
month’s rent deposit to be a reasonable basis to dismiss these applications.   While
it may be the basis for an application by the Tenant, the rental period of
March 2017 forms no part of the L1 application and is not included as part of
the Landlord’s claim in the N4 Notice of termination (thereby making the N4
vulnerable to being defective.   To me, the Tenant’s argument of this issue,
further to my jurisdiction under s.202 of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (“the Act”) seems addressed primarily as a wedge to put off any
discussion of the issues in this application.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from April 15, 2018 to November 14, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 12, 2018.
2.      MO
filed at the hearing a written summary of the Landlord’s financial claims to
the hearing date (this being a tenancy with a 15th to 14th
rental period) which shows arrears of rent of $12,250.00 as well as a claim for
the filing fee, for a total claim of $12,440.00.
 
3.      The
Tenant did not deny the arrears or his persistent pattern of lateness.
 
4.      I
find that the Tenant has been persistently late in paying his rent, with
consecutive lateness from April 2018 to the hearing date.  
 
5.      The
Tenant describes that he has not paid his rent since December 2016 because he
simply has not been able to do so.  He outlined that his bank account has been
frozen –for reasons of which he is not fully aware.  However, he noted, he is
presently hiring a lawyer to address these issues and expects to be in a
position to pay at least $8,750.00 to the Landlord by December 15, 2018 (after
borrowing the money).   
 
6.      The
Tenant did not provide any documentation to support his evidence concerning his
inability to pay the rent arrears.   He admitted that he is not employed but he
is confident he will be able to pay a significant portion of the arrears by
December 15, 2018.
 
7.      However,
the Tenant noted that he has no friends or relatives with whom he can stay if
an eviction order is granted.   He maintained this evidence notwithstanding the
assertion from MO that his mother lives in the GTA and is available to provide
him accommodation.
 
8.      The
Tenant urged me to order a payment plan under which he would have an
opportunity to pay back the arrears over time.
 
9.      The
difficulty with the Tenant’s suggestion of a payment plan is that he has not
really provided any concrete proposal for such a plan and has provided in his
evidence no identified and/or reliable source for such funding.  
 
10.   Based
upon the entirety of the evidence provided, I am not satisfied, given the
extent of the arrears and the Tenant’s less than transparent proposals for
repayment, that a conditional order is appropriate here.
 
11.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
L1 application
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below and subject to the L2 portion of
this order which follows, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before December
8, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $12,819.98*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to November 23, 2018.
 
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $57.53 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting November 28, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
December 8, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from December 9, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before December 8, 2018, then starting December 9,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after December 9,
2018.
 
8.      If,
on or before December 8, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $14,190.00** to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust, the L1 portion of this order for
eviction will be void, subject to the L2 portion of this order which follows
below. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, subject to the L2
portion of this order below and the Tenant could remain in the unit until
December 8, 2018.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside the L1 portion of this order, subject to the L2 portion of this order
which follows, if the Tenant pays the amount required under that subsection on
or after December 9, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
L2 application
 
10.   If
the Tenant voids the L1 portion of this order by paying the amount set out in
paragraph 8 above, the tenancy shall continue until December 8, 2018 on which
date the tenancy is terminated due to persistent late payment of rent. The
Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before December 8, 2018.
 
11.   If
the unit is not vacated on or before December 8, 2018, then starting December
9, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
12.   Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after December 9,
2018.
