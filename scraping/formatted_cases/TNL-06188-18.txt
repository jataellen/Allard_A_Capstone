Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-06188-18










 

QRSGI
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict JO
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's
rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on August 10, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord’s representative, MZ, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from December 1, 2017 to August 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination.
 
2.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,161.58 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
3.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2018
to August 10, 2018.
 
4.      The
Tenant has been persistently late in paying the monthly rent as it comes due.
 
5.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act in relation to the arrears of rent.
6.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act as it relates to late payment of rent, provided that the Tenant pays
all of the arrears as required by this order.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before August 21, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4,321.11*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to August 10, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $38.11 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting August 11, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before August
21, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from August 22, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before August 21, 2018, then starting August 22,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after August 22,
2018.
 
8.      If,
on or before August 21, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $6,463.58** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after August 22, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
10.   If
the Tenant voids the eviction portion of this order as permitted by paragraphs
8 or 9 of this order, the following provisions will apply:
 
a)    From
September 2018 to and including August 2019 the Tenant shall pay the monthly
rent to the Landlord on or before the first business day of the month for which
the rent becomes due.
b)    If
the Tenant fails to make any one of the payments in accordance with paragraph
10a) of this order, the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to
the Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the
tenancy and evicting the Tenant.
