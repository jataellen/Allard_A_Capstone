Order under Section 21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-94248-18-RV










 
 

Review Order
 
B.F.C
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict S.O
and L.E (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This
application was resolved by order TSL-94248-18 issued on April 26, 2018.
 
On
May 25, 2018, the Tenants requested a review of the order, and that the order
be stayed until the request for review is resolved. 
 
On
May 29, 2018, order TSL-94248-18-RV-IN was issued, staying the order issued on
April 26, 2018.
 
The
request was heard in Toronto on July 12, 2018.  The Tenants and the Landlord’s
legal representative, A.S, attended the hearing.  On receiving post-hearing
submissions on July 13, 2018, the hearing was reconvened.  The reconvened
hearing was held on August 23, 2018.  
 
Only
the Landlord’s legal representative, A.S, attended the reconvened hearing.        
 
Determinations:
 
Request
for Review
1.      The
Tenants testified that they had received a telephone call from the Landlord’s legal
representative on April 23, 2018, which the Landlord acknowledged making.  The
Tenants further testified that they had been told by the legal representative in
the phone call that they should not attend the hearing on April 24, 2018
because the application had been made in error and that they should just carry
on in their tenancy. The Landlord’s legal representative denied that was the
content of the conversation, but consented to the request for review being
granted.  The request for review is accordingly granted.
Application
for Rent Arrears
2.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from March 1, 2018 to August 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective March 24, 2018.
3.      The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit. 
4.      The monthly rent as of the date of the hearing is $1,650.00.
5.      The
Tenants paid $1,650.00 after the application was filed.
6.      The
parties agree that the tenancy commenced in March 2018.  The Landlord’s claim
is that the March rent was only received on March 27, 2018 and that no deposit has
been received for last month’s rent. 
7.      The
Tenants testified that they provided a money order to the Landlord dated March
26, 2018 in the amount of $3,300.00 for first and last month’s rent and
provided a copy of the money order at the hearing.  
8.      The
Tenants further testified that they have been consistently paying their monthly
rent in cash to the drop box located in the building. The Tenants testified
that they had a telephone call with Heidi at the office on April 2, 2018 to
confirm that the cash payment had been received.  
9.      The
Tenants were asked for bank records to support their claim that cash payments
had been made to the Landlord.  The Tenants said that they had not anticipated
having to produce records beyond what was alleged in the application and that
as this is their first tenancy, they are naïve about the processes.  The
Tenants said they would get the bank records and return to the hearing prior to
the end of the hearing day.  The Landlord agreed to be present for the end of
the day and the hearing was adjourned on that basis.  
10.   The
Tenants did not return by the end of the July 24, 2018 hearing day.  The
Landlord’s legal representative and two witnesses were present, and there was
no record of the Tenants having called the Board.  I indicated that the failure
to return would result in an order.
11.   The
next morning, I received post-hearing submissions from the Tenants, being records
from their bank showing cash withdrawals in the rent amounts in April, May and
June. The Tenants also provided evidence of calls to the Board in the previous
afternoon.  In the circumstances, I decided to reconvene the hearing at the
earliest possible date. 
12.   I
am satisfied that the Tenants received the Notice of Hearing for the reconvened
date, but did not attend the hearing.  In the circumstances, I do not accept
the Tenant’s evidence of payments made to the Landlord and accept the Landlord’s
ledger of rent arrears.  
13.   The
Landlord has also asked for costs of $1,000.00 for the compensation of time to
deal with the application.  The Landlord has made three attendances for this
matter, each requiring preparation.  On the first attendance, the Tenant’s failed
to appear; at the review hearing, the Landlord waited for the Tenant’s to re-attend
and prepared and attended with two witnesses to rebut the evidence the Tenants
indicated they would lead.  The third attendance was for the reconvening, and
the Landlord again attended with two witnesses.  
14.   Costs
will be considered in circumstances where there has been unreasonable conduct
by the parties. The Tenants failure to appear to pursue their position on
August 23, 2018 calls into question their claims that the rent was paid and I
find that their conduct has caused the Landlord extra preparation and
inconvenience in pursuing this application.  In the circumstances, I will
exercise my discretion to make the maximum cost award of $700.00.
15.   The
Landlord has also asked that the order specify that the Landlord can attend to
the Court Enforcement Office immediately, with eviction to be sought only after
the expiration of the voiding period.  The Landlord also requests a shortened
voiding period, in the circumstances.
16.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
request to review is granted on consent. Order TSL-94248-18 issued on April 26,
2018 is cancelled and replaced by the following.
2.      Unless
the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before August 31, 2018.
3.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $7,952.17*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to August 24, 2018.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $54.25 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting August 25, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
5.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
6.      The
Tenants shall also pay the Landlord costs in the amount of $700.00.
7.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before August
31, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from September 1, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
8.      The
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced upon receipt. However, the Sheriff is
directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
September 1, 2018.
9.      If,
on or before August 31, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $9,140.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
10.   The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after September 1, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to
the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
