Amended Order
Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
And Section 21.1 Statutory Powers
Procedure Act
 
File Number: TNL-08631-18-AM










 
 

YW
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict TS and
AM (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe; and because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they
permitted in the residential complex have substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or
another tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on November 8, 2018.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s representative, QY, and the Tenants
attended the hearing.
 
At the hearing the Tenants raised issues pursuant to section 82 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').
 
 
Determinations:
 
The Landlord’s Application
 
1.      The
parties agreed at the hearing that the Tenants vacated the rental unit on
October 3, 2018.  
 
2.      The
Tenants also agreed at the hearing that they have not paid the total rent they
were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2018 to October 3, 2018.  At
the hearing, the Tenants agreed with the Landlord’s evidence of the Tenants’
rental arrears to October 3, 2018.  The Tenants did not pay rent to the
Landlord for approximately three months.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective September 12, 2018.
 
3.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $2,500.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
4.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from June 12, 2017
to September 12, 2018.
 
5.      Since
the Tenants vacated the rental unit on October 3, 2018, the Landlord withdrew
her application to terminate the tenancy for substantially interfering with the
reasonable enjoyment of the property by, or another lawful right, privilege or
interest of, the Landlord or another tenant.
The
Tenants’ Section 82 Issues
6.      The
Tenants alleged that the Landlord damaged the Tenants’ coffee maker and baby
bottle warmer when the Landlord attempted to repair a microwave oven in the
kitchen on September 13, 2018.
 
7.      The
Tenants, however, did not have reliable evidence to determine that any act or
omission by the Landlord damaged the Tenants’ small appliances.  Although the
Tenants suspect that the Landlord may have caused a power surge while
inspecting the microwave oven, the Tenants’ belief alone is not probative
evidence of the Landlord’s responsibility for any damage to the Tenants’ small
appliances.
 
8.      I
therefore find that the Tenants did not prove that the Landlord damaged the
Tenants’ small appliances.
 
9.      The
Tenants did prove that the Landlord did not repair the microwave oven in a
reasonable period of time.  Although the Tenants first advised the Landlord via
email message in August 2018 that they were experiencing trouble with the
microwave oven, the Landlord did not repair the oven until October 2018.  The
Landlord’s evidence that the Tenants refused to allow the Landlord to enter the
rental unit to inspect the microwave oven on August 16, 2018 because of a
scheduling conflict does not release the Landlord from her obligation to
maintain and repair the rental property under the Act.  Indeed, there was no
evidence of a further attempt to repair the microwave oven until September 13,
2018, when the Landlord attempted to plug the microwave oven into other kitchen
outlets.  The microwave oven was eventually repaired on October 3, 2018, the
same day the Tenants vacated the rental unit.
 
10.   The
Tenants were not able to use the microwave oven for approximately two months. 
Although the Tenants’ primary section 82 issues involved their coffee maker and
baby bottle warmer, I find it is appropriate to order the Landlord to pay a
lump-sum $100.00 abatement of rent to the Tenants for unreasonably delaying
work to repair the microwave oven.
Conclusion
11.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.  The Tenants vacated the
rental unit on October 3, 2018.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants moved
out of the rental unit on October 3, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $5,055.82*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to October 3, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit the Landlord owes the Tenants.
 
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
4.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before December
14, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from December 15, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
