Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-17478-19
 











 
 
 

API  (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict FOA and BA (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on December 20,
2019.
 
The Landlord’s legal
representative, NM, and the Tenant, BA, attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The matter was first heard on August 8, 2019. 
The Tenant raised a number of maintenance issues, pursuant to section 82 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’), and the matter was
adjourned.
 
2.      The Tenant was ordered, in TNL-17487-19-IN,
issued on August 8, 2019, to disclose in writing all the section 82 issues of
the Act that were going to be raised, as well as ordered to pay the full rent
on time, going forward.
 
3.      The Tenant failed to disclose the maintenance
issues to the Landlord, and also failed to pay the rent, in full, on the first
day of every month.  Instead, the arrears increased considerably in the interim
period.  Consequently, the Tenant was not permitted to raise the maintenance
issues at the hearing.
 
4.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from June 1,
2019 to December 31, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a
Notice of Termination.
 
5.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,190.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
 
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2019 to December 31,
2019.
 
7.     
The Landlord is seeking a
standard termination order.  The Landlord’s legal representative said that the
Tenant has only paid a small amount towards the rent since June, 2019, and the
arrears are substantial.
 
8.     
The Tenant is seeking to
preserve the tenancy.  She said that she had an accident in October, 2019, and
she lost her job on October 10, 2019.  She said that her job will recommence on
December 31, 2019.  The Tenant said that the job is full time, for a 40 hour
week at $20.00 per hour.  She did not have documentation to support her
testimony, but she had an electronic message from an organization called P that
indicated a job for seven hours per day for four days per week.
 
9.      The Tenant testified that when she starts
working, she will pay $1,000.00 towards the arrears, in addition to the full
rent each month, until the arrears are paid off.
 
10.  
The Tenant said that she
does not have enough money to move elsewhere.  She said that she now lives in
the rental unit with two young children.
 
11.  
The Tenant did not have an
explanation for why she had not paid rent between June and August, when she
alleged that she was working 30 hours per week as a personal support worker at
that time.  The Tenant also did not have any documentary evidence to support
her testimony about her income from the new job, or whether she is, in fact,
employed.
 
12.  
The arrears have continued
to increase, and the Tenant has not paid anything at all towards the rent since
early October, 2019.  It is very prejudicial to the Landlord for the tenancy to
continue.
 
13.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and, for the above reasons, find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
the Act.  The arrears are substantial, and they are increasing.  This tenancy
is no longer viable, as the Tenant could not prove, on a balance of
probabilities, that she has the income to support the full rent, going forward.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenants void the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before February
3, 2020.
 
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $6,481.97*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to January 23, 2020, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $42.28 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting January 24, 2020 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 3, 2020, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
February 4, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 3, 2020, then starting February 4, 2020, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 4, 2020.
 
8.     
If the Tenants wish to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $8,182.12 if the payment is made on or before January 31, 2020, or
ii)       $9,468.28 if the payment is made on or before February 3, 2020**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after February 4,
2020 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
