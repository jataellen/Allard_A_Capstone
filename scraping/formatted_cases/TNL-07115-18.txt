            Order
under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-07115-18



 


 


 



 
 
DV
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict CL
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant gave a notice to terminate the tenancy.
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the
Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage; and because the
Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in
the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit
after the termination date.
 
This
application was heard in Newmarket on August 29, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant did not give a notice to terminate the tenancy in writing. I therefore
find that the tenancy cannot be terminated on this ground.
 
2.      The
Landlord served an N5 Notice to End the Tenancy, but did not give the 20 days’
notice required by the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). The
N5 is therefore defective and cannot support termination of the tenancy.
3.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from July 1, 2018 to August 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination.
 
4.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $900.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 2, 2018 to
August 31, 2018.
 
6.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before September 11, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $695.96*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to August 31, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $26.30 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting September 1, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
September 11, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from September 12, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before September 11, 2018, then starting
September 12, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after September 12,
2018.
 
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $1,790.00 if the payment is made on or before August 31, 2018, or
ii)       $2,590.00 if the payment is made after August 31, 2018 but on or
before September 11, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
 
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after September 12, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
