INTERIM ORDER 
 
P R and A D (the 'Tenants') applied for an order determining
that C E-Z (the ‘Landlord’) substantially interfered with their reasonable
enjoyment, harassed them, and withheld or interefered with the supply of a
vital service (TST-06337-19), for an order determining that the Landlord failed
to meet her maintenance obligations (TST-07083-19), and for an order
determining that the RTA applies to the tenancy (TST-07023-19).
 
The Landlord applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and collect rent arrears (TSL-07607-19), and for an order to terminate
the tenancy because of substantial interference with her reasonable enjoyment
or lawful rights (TSL-07607-19).
 
A case management hearing was held in Toronto on
September 3, 2019 for TST-06337-19, TST-07083-19, and TSL-07961-19.  At the
hearing, the scope of the case management hearing was expanded to also include
TST-07023-19 and TSL-07607-19.
 
The Tenant A D, the Tenants’
representative R H, and the Landlord attended the case management hearing.
 
Reasons:
Does the RTA apply?
1.   
The parties are in agreement
that the RTA applies to this tenancy.  I am satisfied that they are correct,
since it is a tenancy for the purpose of residential occupancy by the Tenants.
2.   
Application TST-07023-19
will therefore be resolved by an order determining that the RTA applies.
Scheduling
3.   
I am satisfied that the
remaining four applications should be heard together.  The Tenants will be
arguing that the Landlord is in serious breach of her obligations, such that
eviction must be denied pursuant to subsection 83(3)(a) of the RTA.  The
Tenants’ applications raise allegations which, if found to be true, could give
rise to a finding of serious breach.  Hence, the Landlord’s applications to
evict the Tenants cannot be heard without also hearing the Tenants’
applications to determine whether eviction is barred.
4.   
All four applications will
therefore be rescheduled to be heard together.
Interim payments
5.    In regards to application TSL-07607-19
respecting rent arrears, the parties have agreed to an interim payment schedule
as set out below.  As security pending the outcome of the proceedings, the
Tenants will have the option to make the payments into the Board.
Particulars of the Tenants’ applications
6.   
The Tenants’ applications do
not currently contain sufficient particulars, and cannot be heard in their
current form.  Particulars should include the specifics of each thing the
Landlord is alleged to have done, including dates.
7.   
For example, the
applications allege that “the Landlord has disparaged one of the Tenants on
many occasions by disparaging and insulting his religious beliefs, practice,
and deportment.”  In order for that allegation to be heard, the application
must set out what, specifically, the Landlord said to the Tenant, and when she
said it.  There are other allegations in the applications which similarly lack
particulars.
8.   
The Tenants will be required
to amend their application by the deadline set out below.  At the hearing of
these matters, the Board will refuse to consider any allegations which are not
sufficiently particularized.
Particulars of the Landlord’s application
9.   
The Landlord’s application
TSL-07961-19 respecting substantial interference is also insufficiently
particularized.  The application is based on an N5 notice of termination the
Landlord served.  The N5 has similar issues to the Tenants’ applications, i.e.
several of the allegations set out in it do not contain dates and/or adequate
details of what the Tenants are alleged to have done.
10. Unlike the Tenants’ applications, application
TSL-07961-19 cannot be amended to provide further particulars.  Pursuant to Ball
v. Metro Capital Property, [2002] O.J. No. 5931 (ONSC DC), a notice of
termination must, at the time it is served, contain sufficient particulars. 
The N5 notice cannot be amended after the fact.
11. At the start of the hearing of these matters,
the Board will hear the parties’ submissions and then make a finding as to
which of the allegations in the N5 are sufficiently particularized.  The
hearing of application TSL-07961-19 will be limited to those issues.
Disclosure
12. Normally, I would order a timeline for the parties to
disclose their evidence to each other.  In this case, since the issues to be
heard in these applications have yet to be clarified, I think that a disclosure
timeline would be premature.  At this time, the parties will only be required
to disclose their evidence prior to the hearing.  If a further disclosure order
is required, it can be requested at the hearing.
It is ordered that:
 
1.   
The RTA applies to the
tenancy between the parties.
2.   
Applications TST-06337-19,
TST-07083-19, TSL-07607-19, ad TSL-07961-19 are adjourned to be heard together
on a date to be set by the Board.
3.   
Until these matters are
heard, the Tenants shall make the following payments, either to the Landlord or
into the Board:
October 15, 2019                  $4,800.00
November 15, 2019             $4,800.00
December 15, 2019             $4,800.00
January 15, 2020                 $4,800.00
4.   
On or before September 30,
2019, the Tenants shall amend their applications, following the Board’s rules
respecting amendments, so as to provide adequate particulars of all the
allegations.
5.   
At the hearing of these
matters, the Board shall consider, as a preliminary issue, which allegations in
the Landlord’s and Tenants’ applications are adequately particularized.  The
Board will refuse to hear any allegations that have not been adequately
particularized.
6.   
Before the day of the
hearing, the parties shall give each other copies of all the documents, photos,
or other physical evidence they intend to introduce at the hearing.
