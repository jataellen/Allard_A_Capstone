Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-93873-18
 










 

R.P.L
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict A.S.F
(“ASF”) and K.F (“KF”) (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent
that the Tenants owe (“the L1 application”).
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenants because the Tenants have been persistently late in paying their rent
(“the L2 application”).
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on May 1, 2018.
 
S.H
(“SH”), the Landlord’s legal representative attended the hearing.  The Tenant,
ASF, also attended the hearing on behalf of the Tenants.
 
Prior
to the hearing, the parties mutually agreed to resolve all issues in the L1
application and requested that this portion of the order reflect an order on
consent.   The L2 portion of the application was contested as more particularly
set out below.
 
Preliminary Issue:
 
1.   
On consent, the application was amended to correct the surname of
ASF to read “F” rather than “F” as originally shown in the application.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from February 1, 2018 to May 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective March 3, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenants paid $3,476.04 after the application was filed.
 
 
3.      The
parties agreed that as of the hearing date, the amount owed by the Tenants to
the Landlord pursuant to the L1 application is $1,437.36 comprised of $1,247.36
in arrears and $190.00 for the filing fee.
 
4.      ASF,
on behalf of the Tenants, consented to pay the amount noted in paragraph 3
within 11 days of the Board’s order.
 
5.      The
Tenants have been persistently late in paying their rent.
 
6.      SH,
on behalf of the Landlord, requested a termination of the tenancy in the event
the Tenants void the L1 portion of this order.  SH described, and filed
particulars at the hearing, that the Landlord has brought at least 4 previous
applications to the Board in respect to this tenancy, beginning in 2010.  Under
the circumstances, and the many opportunities given to the Tenants to preserve
their tenancy, in SH’s submission, the tenancy should be terminated.
 
7.      ASF
explained that KF runs his own business which has been struggling.  Any income
generated by this business has been re-invested to keep the enterprise going. 
Until last year, ASF neither worked nor managed the tenancy on behalf of the
Tenants.
 
8.      ASF
noted that for the most part, she had not been aware of the issues with the
tenancy, including the previous applications to the Board which had been
handled by KF.  With new employment for ASF, and her pledge to manage issues
with the tenancy on behalf of the family, ASF requested that a conditional
order be granted on the L2 to allow the Tenants to maintain their tenancy,
particularly insofar as the family includes two teenage children who are
attending schools in the area.
 
9.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,168.08 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
10.   Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2018
to March 3, 2018.
 
11.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act. 
 
12.   On
the totality of the evidence and submissions presented at the hearing, I
believe it is reasonable, particularly in light of the Tenants’ children who
live in the unit with them, and ASF’s pledge at the hearing to: a) manage the
issues with the tenancy going forward; b) pay on time from June 2018 and
thereafter, to grant the Tenants one final opportunity to preserve this
tenancy.
 
13.   As
such, with respect to the L2 portion of this order, I have granted ASF’s
request, on behalf of the Tenants, for a conditional, pay-on-time order, as set
out below.
It is ordered that:
 
L1 application: On consent
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before May 20, 2018.
 
2.      As
of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation
the Landlord is entitled to by $783.78*.
 
3.      However,
the Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the
Landlord owes the Tenants: $38.48 per day for compensation for the use of the
unit starting May 10, 2018 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit, and
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.      The
Landlord or the Tenants shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as
a result of this order.
 
5.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before May 20, 2018, then starting May 21, 2018,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 21, 2018.
 
7.      If,
on or before May 20, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $1,437.36** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, the L1 portion of this order for eviction
will be void.  This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the
Tenants could remain in the unit, subject to the L2 portion of this order as
set out below.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after May 21, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
L2 application
 
9.     
If the Tenants void the L1 portion of this order by paying the
amount as set out in paragraph 7 above, the L1 portion of this order shall be
void and the tenancy shall continue subject to the conditions set out in the
following paragraphs.
 
10.   For
the 12-month period beginning in June 2018 and continuing for each month until
May 2019 inclusive, the Tenants shall pay the monthly rent to the Landlord on
or before the first day of each month. 
 
11.   If
the Tenants fail to make any of the payments in accordance with the L2 portion
of this order in full and on time, the Landlord may apply under s.78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 within 30 days of the breach and without notice to the
Tenants for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants.
