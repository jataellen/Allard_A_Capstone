G.&H.M.L.(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict C.W. and J.W. (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on May 2, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, B.
R., and the Tenant, C.W., on behalf of both Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent they were required to pay for the period from November 1, 2017
to May 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective March 20, 2018.
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,040.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from September 1, 2012 to March 20,
2018.
4.     
At the hearing, the Tenant
was asked about her personal circumstances that led to the rental arrears. She
testified that her husband was off work from December 2017 to March 2018 for
medical reasons.
5.     
She testified that he has
now returned to work and nets approximately $800 per week as a forklift
warehouse manager. The Tenant also testified that she has been off work for
medical reasons and is now returning to clean houses. She states that she can
earn up to $3600.00 monthly if she is busy. She did not bring any supporting
documentation on income to the hearing.
6.     
The evidence provided by the
Tenant on the other monthly household expenses suggested that the Tenants are
very tight in meeting their monthly rental obligations. They have one 23 year
old child living in their home.
7.     
The Tenant offered to pay
the Landlord $2200.00 towards the arrears at the hearing and the balance on May
12, 2018. Her evidence indicated that she believed that she could pay all
arrears off by the middle of May 2018. As this decision is dated well after the
May 12, 2018 payment schedule offered by the Tenant, the Tenants have an opportunity
to void, if they wish too and they have been given extra time.
8.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before June 3,
2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $2,654.00*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to May 23, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $37.16 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting May 24, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 3, 2018, the Tenants will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June 4,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 3, 2018, then starting June 4, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 4, 2018.
8.     
If the Tenants wish to
void this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $4,250.85 if the payment is made on or before May 31, 2018, or
ii)       $5,381.02 if the payment is made on or before June 3, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after June 4, 2018
but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
