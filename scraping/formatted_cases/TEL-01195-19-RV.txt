Statutory Powers

Tenancies Act, 2006

Review Order
 
S.S. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy because J.W. (the 'Tenant') abandoned the rental unit.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
The hearing was held in Toronto on August
7, 2019. Neither the Landlord nor the Tenant were present or represented at the
hearing.
This application was dismissed as abandoned by order
TEL-01195-19 issued on August 19, 2019.
 
On September 17, 2019, the Landlord
requested a review of the order.
 
The request was heard in Toronto
on October 16, 2019.
 
Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
 
Also in attendance was the Landlord’s
witness, B.M.. 
 
Determinations:
 
            REQUEST TO REVIEW
1.     
The Landlord’s request to review alleges that the
Landlord was not reasonably able to participate at the hearing on August 7, 2019
because he was out of town. He testified that he indicated this on the application
that he filed electronically on May 10, 2019. 
2.     
When he received the notice of hearing, he came to
the Board reiterating that he was not available but the hearing went ahead on August
7, 2019 and his application was dismissed. 
3.     
I note in the application the Landlord indicated
on the Payment and Scheduling Information Form the following:
JUNE 16TH,
2019 – AUGUST 10TH I AM NOT AVAILABLE
4.     
There is also a Record of Transaction dated May 28,
2019 which confirms that the Board spoke with the Landlord who indicated that he
was unavailable June 5, 2019 to August 30, 2019. 
5.     
Thus, based on the evidence before me, I am satisfied
that the Landlord was not reasonably able to participate at the hearing on August
7, 2019 because the Board made an error and scheduled the hearing for a date that
the Landlord was not available. Thus, the Landlord’s request to review is granted
and a new hearing was held for the Landlord’s application. 
L2 APPLICATION FOR
ABANDONMENT
6.     
The Board’s Interpretation Guideline
4 entitled Abandonment of a Rental Unit explains the concept of abandonment as
follows:
 
Abandonment is a unilateral act by the tenant to relinquish
their tenancy and give up possession of the rental unit without properly giving
notice of the termination to the landlord. If the landlord is not sure whether
or not a rental unit has been abandoned, they may file an application for
determination of this issue with the Board; however, it should be noted the
Board has no jurisdiction to issue an order for rent or compensation if a
tenant is no longer in possession of the rental unit (see section 87). In this
case, the landlord may seek a remedy by applying to Court.
 
Section 2(3) of the RTA provides that a rental unit is not
considered abandoned where the tenant is not in arrears of rent. Even if there
is evidence of abandonment, such as the furniture being removed, the landlord
cannot treat the unit as abandoned before the end of the rental period if the
rent is fully paid.
 
7.     
The Landlord described the residential
premises as a house with four rooms; each room is a separate tenancy. The Tenant
resided in room 2. 
8.     
The Landlord’s witness, B.M.
(BM) testified that he was the tenant of room 1 at the residential complex. He stated
that the Tenant had told him in the first week of January 2019 that he was going
to the States. He didn’t provide any information of when and if he would be coming
back. BM testified that he has not seen the Tenant since then. 
9.     
The Landlord’s evidence was that
the Tenant paid half the rent for January 2019 and told him he would be late on
the other half, he just needed some more time. Since then, the Tenant has not made
any rent payments. The Landlord also contacted the Tenant ’s housing worker at Salvation
Army (on January 25 or 28, 2019) but did not receive a response. 
10.  
The Landlord testified that he
has still not see or heard from the Tenant as of the hearing date. Further, when
he conducted an inspection of the rental unit in February 1, 2019, he found just
two garbage bags of clothes and a mattress that was given to the Tenant by Salvation
Army left in the rental unit. There were no valuables that remained in the rental
unit. 
11.  
The Landlord confirmed that the
keys have not yet been returned to the Landlord.
12.  
I am satisfied based on the Landlord’s
uncontested evidence described above that the Tenant has abandoned the rental unit.
 
13.   I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be necessary to
grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenant
has vacated the rental unit.
14.   This order contains all of the reasons for my
decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The request to review order
TEL-01195-19 issued on August 19, 2019 is granted. 
 
2.     
Order TEL-01195-19 is replaced
with the following order.
3.     
The application is amended to
reflect the correct last name of the Tenant as Woodbury.
4.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated as of February 1, 2019 as the Tenant has
abandoned the rental unit. 
5.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
6.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing on or before August 3, 2020, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from August 4, 2020
at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
7.     
The Board shall return to the
Landlord $55.00 which represents the Landlord’s cost of filing the review based
on the Board’s scheduling error.
