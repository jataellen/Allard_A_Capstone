Order under Section 100
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-10697-19
 











 
 

# S I. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy of L T and P R B (the 'Tenants'), and for compensation
for the use of the rental unit.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on January 9,
2020.
 
The Landlord and the Landlord’s
legal representative M. M and the Tenants attended the hearing. The parties
consented to this application and application TSL-10696-19 being heard together
as they relate to the same allegations of unauthorized transfer of rental
units. Separate orders will be issued for each application. 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
For the reasons that follow, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated as the Tenants have transferred the
tenancy to another person without the Landlord’s consent.
Background
Facts
2.     
On September 30, 2019, the Landlord filed an
application with the Board to terminate the tenancy between the Landlord and
the Tenants and to evict the unauthorized occupant(s) and to order the
unauthorized occupant(s) to pay compensation for each day they remain in the
rental unit (‘A2 application’).
3.     
The Landlord’s Building Manager L H (‘LH’)
testified that at the time the application was filed an unauthorized
occupant(s) was in possession of the unit and continued to be in possession of
the unit to the date of the hearing.
4.     
LH testified that the Landlord learned that the
Tenants had vacated their unit, moved into unit 1101, and allowed unauthorized
occupants to move into their unit on September 23, 2019. This arose as a result
of an investigation into the tenants in unit 1101 vacating their rental unit.
5.     
LH testified that on September 4, 2019 the
Landlord learned that the tenant in unit 1101 had moved out of his rental unit.
LH testified that the elevator had been booked by unit 1101 for August 31, 2019
and was used for approximately 2 hours to move furniture out of the building.
The elevator was never booked again by the tenants of unit 1101 in order to
move any furniture back into their unit. On September 4, 2019, the Landlord
attended at unit 1101 and took photos of the unit showing an empty living room,
dining room, closets, bedrooms, bathroom and cupboards. (Exhibit 7)
6.     
The Landlord was advised by another tenant on
the 11th floor that after the tenant’s furniture was moved out of unit 1101,
the Tenants were observed moving their furniture from unit 1112 and into unit
1101. LH testified that neither the Tenants nor unit 1101 had been granted permission
to sublet or transfer possession of their rental units. 
7.     
On September 23, 2019, LH performed a second
inspection of unit 1101 and saw that it had been re-furnished and that there
was a picture of the female Tenant and thier daughter on the bedroom dresser in
unit 1101. (Exhibit 9)
8.     
LH also attended at the rental unit for an
inspection on September 23, 2019. Upon inspection the unit was found to be
almost completely empty, with only two beds in the bedroom. (Exhibit 11) There
were also other people in the unit who stated that they lived in unit 1807, who
denied that they were residing in unit 1112. LH testified that the Landlord subsequently
confirmed these individuals were not in fact tenants of units 1807.
9.     
LH testified that the Tenants continue to pay
rent for the rental unit. 
10.  
LH testified that the tenant in unit 1101 has
not been seen since August of 2019 and the Landlord believes that the Tenants
have vacated their rental unit and have sublet of unit 1101 without the
Landlord’s permission. LH testified that the Landlord did not enter into a
tenancy agreement with the persons found to be in unit 1112.
11.  
The Tenant L T (‘LT) testified that the Tenants
remain in the unit and have not sublet the rental unit. LT testified that her
family has a close friendship with the tenant in unit 1101 and that is why
there is now a picture of the Tenant and her child in the bedroom of unit 1101.

Analysis
12.  
Section 100 of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006, S.O. 2006, c.17 (‘Act’) speaks to the unauthorized transfer of a
tenancy and a landlord’s right to terminate the tenancy and evict a tenant and
a person to whom occupancy of the rental unit was transferred. 
13.  
Subsection 100(2) of the Act requires a landlord
to apply to the Board within sixty days of discovering an unauthorized
occupancy. I find that the Landlord applied to the Board within the sixty-day
time period.
14.  
Having considered the evidence before the Board,
I find on a balance of probabilities that the Tenant vacated the rental unit,
moved into unit 1101, and transferred occupancy of their rental unit to others contrary
to the Act.
15.  
I did not find the evidence of the Tenant to be
credible. I further find it unlikely that the tenant in unit 1101 would keep a
photo of another tenant’s wife and daughter on his bedroom dresser.
16.  
Overall, I did not find the evidence of the
Tenant to be credible or persuasive and I preferred the evidence of LH that the
Tenants vacated the unit some time prior to September 23, 2019, moved into unit
1101, and transferred occupancy of the unit in a manner that was not authorized
by the Act. 
17.  
On the evidence before the Board, I find that
there was a transfer of occupancy and it was neither with the permission or
consent of the Landlord.
18.  
The Landlord is entitled to compensation for the
use and occupation of the rental unit by the Unauthorized Occupant.
19.  
The Landlord has incurred the cost of $190.00
for filing the application and is entitled to reimbursement of those costs. 
20.  
I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006, and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until January 31, 2020 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act, as
there are no arrears of rent and the rent has been fully paid to the end of the
month. 
21.  
Tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
will be terminated
It is ordered that:
1.    The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated as of
January 31, 2020. 
2.    The Unauthorized Occupant shall move out of the rental unit on or
before January 31, 2020.
3.    The Unauthorized Occupant shall also pay to the Landlord $36.15 per
day for compensation for the use of the unit from February 1, 2020 to the date
they move out of the unit.
4.    The Unauthorized Occupant shall also pay the Landlord $190.00 for
the cost of filing the application.
5.    The Unauthorized Occupant shall pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before January 22, 2020.
6.    If the Unauthorized Occupant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing by January 22, 2020 they will owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from January 23, 2020 at 3.00% on the outstanding balance.
7.    If the unit is not vacated by January 31, 2020 then starting
February 1, 2020, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (the Sheriff), so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.    Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord after
February 1, 2020.
