Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-20997-19
 











 
 

TAMI (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict MJS (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes (L1 application). 
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenants because they have been persistently late in
paying their rent (L2 application). 
 
This application was heard in Toronto on January 16,
2020.
 
The Landlord’s representative, SB
and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from August 1, 2019 to
January 31, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective August 23, 2019.
2.     
The monthly rent as of the
date of the hearing is $1,489.37.
3.     
The Tenant paid $6,305.00
after the application was filed.
4.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,407.11 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2019 to August 23, 2019.
6.     
There was no dispute that
the Tenant owes $831.22, which represents the arrears of rent to January 31,
2020 and the application filing fee.
7.     
There was no dispute that
the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the rent when due. 
8.     
The Tenant has lived in the
unit since 2013. She lives in the unit with her daughter (5 years old). The
Tenant has a total monthly income of about $2,134.00. The Tenant has been
sending funds back home to her son and this caused her to be unable to pay the
full rent when due. 
9.     
The Tenant understood that
she made a mistake by not ensuring that the rent was paid in full; and payment
of the rent should be given priority over other expenses. 
10.  
The Tenant requested relief
and stated that she can pay the arrears by January 31, 2020 and can pay the
rent when due, commencing February 1, 2020. 
11.  
The Landlord requested a
standard order and to terminate the tenancy. The Landlord was not persuaded
that the Tenant can sustain this tenancy and pay the rent when due. 
12.  
I considered the length of
the tenancy and that the Tenant’s proposal to pay all the arrears by January
31, 2020 is reasonable. In addition, I considered that the Act is remedial, and
I will give the Tenant an opportunity to continue the tenancy if she pays the
rent when due. 
13.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.  
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before January
31, 2020.
2.     
As of the date of this
order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the Landlord is
entitled to by $721.71*.
3.     
However, the Landlord is
authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the Landlord owes
the Tenant:
$48.97 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 21,
2020 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit, and $190.00 for the cost of
filing the application.
4.     
The Landlord or the Tenant
shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
5.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2020, then starting February 1, 2020, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
6.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 1, 2020.
7.     
If, the Tenant wishes to
void the order pertaining to arrears of rent, then the Tenant shall pay on or
before January 31, 2020, the amount of $831.22** to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, and this order for eviction based on arrears of rent will be
void.  This means that the tenancy would not be terminated for arrears of rent and
the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and
on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order based
on arrears of rent if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 1, 2020 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
L2 application: 
9.     
Commencing February 1, 2020 and for a period of 12 consecutive months (February
2020 to January 2021), the Tenant shall pay the monthly rent on or before the 1st
day of each month.
 
10.  
If the Tenant fails to make
any of the payments under paragraph 9, above, in full and on time, the Landlord
may apply under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, (the 'Act') within 30 days of the breach, without notice to the Tenant,
for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant.
