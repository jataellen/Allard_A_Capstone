Order
under Section 21.2 of the 
Statutory
Powers Procedure Act 
and
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006

Number: SWL-13848-18-RV











 

Review
Order
 
J.D. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict L.J. and S.K. (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application
was resolved by order SWL-13848-18 issued on May 8, 2018.
 
On May 15, 2018, the
Tenants requested a review of the order and that the order be stayed until the
request to review the order is resolved.
 
On May 28, 2018, the
Landlord and Tenant Board (the ‘Board’) issued interim order
SWL-13848-18-RV-IN, staying the order issued on May 8, 2018.  The interim order
dismissed all of the Tenants’ claims for review of the order issued on May 8,
2018 except for a possible error with respect to the original hearing Member’s
exercise of discretion related to relief under section 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).  On June 6, 2018, the Landlord requested a
review of the interim order issued on May 28, 2018.
 
The review request was
heard in Waterloo on June 26, 2018.  Only the Landlord and the Landlord’s Legal
Representative, R.H., attended the hearing.  As of 10:33 a.m., the Tenants were
not present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice
of this hearing by the Board. 
 
Determinations and
Reasons:
 
1.     Since the Tenants did not appear at the hearing
to support the review request, I find that this request has been abandoned. 
2.     
The Tenants eventually
attended at 11:23 a.m.  As the Landlord and the Landlord’s Legal Representative
had left the hearing site, it was not possible to recall the matter.  The
Tenants indicated that they had attempted to contact the Board on the morning
of the hearing.  Board records indicate that the Tenant, S.K., called the Board
to indicate that she would probably not make it to the hearing “as her agenda
is not running on time.”  She was informed by a Customer Service Officer that the
hearing could proceed without her.  This message was relayed to security at the
hearing site only after the hearing had concluded and the Landlord had
departed.
3.     
In light of the Tenants’
failure to contact the Board in a timely manner that they would not attend the
hearing site, I do not find that they were denied a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the hearing of their review request.
4.     On the basis of the submissions made in the
request, I am not satisfied that there is a serious error in the order or that
a serious error occurred in the proceedings.
5.     This order contains all of the reasons in this
matter and no further reasons will issue.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The request to review order SWL-13848-18, issued
on May 8, 2018 is denied.  The order is confirmed and remains unchanged.
2.     The interim order issued on May 28, 2018 is
cancelled.  The stay of order SWL-13848-18 is lifted.
3.     The Landlord’s request for a review of interim
order SWL-13848, issued on May 28, 2018, is dismissed as moot.
