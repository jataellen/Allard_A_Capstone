Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
 
File Number: TNL-22974-19
 
 
 
 
Numbered Company Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict AH, SH, AS, (‘AAS’) and SSS (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe. The
Landlord also claimed administration charges related to NSF cheques.
 
This application was heard in Newmarket on January 22,
2020.
 
The Landlord's Representative, CC,
and the Tenant AAS, on behalf of all Tenants, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from November
15, 2019 to February 14, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a
Notice of Termination.
 
2.     
The Tenant is in possession
of the rental unit. 
 
3.     
The monthly rent as of the
date of the hearing is $2,850.00.
 
4.     
The Landlord incurred
charges of $20.00 for administration charges related to cheques tendered by or
on behalf of the Tenants, which were returned NSF.
 
5.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $2,850.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
 
 
 
 
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from April 16, 2019 to January 29, 2020.
 
7.     
The Tenant AAS did not
dispute the amount of arrears but indicated that work had been slow for him over
the winter season and he had had no funds with which to pay the rent.  I note
that no rent has been paid since October 2019.  He indicated that he had a few
large jobs (he does auto body work) for which he will be collecting payment through
to the end of February 2020 and requested that he be given additional time to
assemble payment.
 
8.     
The timing on this standard
order will give the Tenants some time to assemble funds to void the order and I
do not consider that additional time is warranted in the circumstances.
 
9.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before February
9, 2020.
 
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $4,234.73*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to January 29, 2020 and the total charges related to an NSF cheque tendered
to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenants, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $93.70 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting January 30, 2020 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 9, 2020, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
February 10, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 9, 2020, then starting February 10, 2020, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 10, 2020.
 
8.     
If, on or before February 9,
2020, the Tenants pay the amount of $8,745.00** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated, and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after February 10,
2020 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
