Order
under Section 21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-80483-17-RV2
 
 
 
Review Order
 
A.W-S.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict J.H.
and N.F. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This
application was resolved by order TEL-80483-17 issued on July 13, 2017.
 
On
July 14, 2017, the Tenants requested a review of the order. The Tenants’
request was sent to an oral hearing and resolved by order TEL-80483-17-RV
issued on August 1, 2017.
 
On
August 8, 2017, the Tenants requested a review of order TEL-80483-17-RV issued
on August 1, 2017.
 
A
preliminary review of the review request was completed without a hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     Pursuant
to Rule 29.17 of the Board’s Rules of Practice:
The LTB will not consider
a further request to review the original order or the review order from the
same requestor.
2.     Given
the wording of this Rule it is not entirely clear to me that the Tenants have
the right to seek a second review with respect to this application. 
3.     The
first request for review was signed by only one Tenant, the second-named Tenant
above, but consistently uses the word “we” in the details provided for the
basis of the review. In addition, this appears to be a joint tenancy and the
first-named Tenant above attended the hearing of the first review request,
testified and made submissions. 
4.     As
a result, this would appear to be a second review request by the Tenants which
is not permitted by Rule 29.17. 
5.     However,
Rule 29.18 says:
Another party or directly
affected person may request a review of the same order on different grounds.
[Emphasis added.]
6.     The
Tenants’ second review request is once again only signed by one Tenant, but
this time it is the first-named Tenant above. 
7.     Given
the ambiguity created by the wording of the Rules with respect to second
reviews I am prepared to consider the merits of this second review request, but
on the basis of the submissions made in the request and for the reasons stated
below, I am not satisfied that there is a serious error in the order or that a
serious error occurred in the proceedings.
8.     The
Tenants’ first review request alleged the Tenants were not reasonably able to
participate in the original hearing held on June 30, 2017. It also asserts the
Tenants dispute the amount of rent arrears being claimed by the Landlord.
9.     The
Tenants’ second review request says:
(1)  The Tenants’
did not have a chance to meet with Tenant Duty Counsel before the hearing.
(2)  The
Tenants asked for an adjournment because they could not find all of their
receipts prior to the review hearing. The Member denied that request and the
Tenants have now located the missing receipts which are attached to the review
request.
(3)  The
amount of rent arrears claimed by the Landlord is wrong as demonstrated by the
additional rent receipts.  
THE ISSUE WITH TENANT DUTY COUNSEL
10.  With
respect to the first issue stated above, whether or not the Tenants had a
chance to discuss their issues with Tenant Duty Counsel before the review
hearing or not is immaterial. 
11.  Reviews
are primarily intended to address Board errors; their secondary purpose is to
ensure a party that cannot reasonably attend a hearing has a chance to do so.
Reviews are not a second opportunity to do a better job at presenting a party’s
case. 
12.  Further,
the Board does not actually provide Tenant Duty Counsel. It is a service
provided by Legal Aid Ontario independently of the Board. So anything that
occurred with respect to Tenant Duty Counsel cannot constitute an error by the
Board. 
13.  I would
also note that the record before the Board indicates the Tenants had ample time
to seek legal advice. The Tenants’ first review states that the Tenants
contacted their local legal aid clinic for advice prior to filing the first
review request. In addition, the Tenants were represented by Tenant Duty
Counsel at the review hearing. So the Tenants were aware of and accessed the
free legal services available to them.
14.  As a
result it simply cannot be said that there was a serious error on the part of
the Board or with respect to the Board’s procedure related to the Tenants’
opportunities to seek legal advice.
THE
ADJOURNMENT ISSUE
15.  With
respect to the second issue set out above, the decision as to whether or not to
grant adjournment is a discretionary one. Pursuant to the Board’s non-binding
Interpretation Guideline 8 entitled Review of an Order, a Member’s
discretionary decisions are entitled to deference as long as they do not fall
outside the reasonable range of normal outcomes. 
16.  Here, the
Member’s refusal of the adjournment request was wholly reasonable. 
17.  The
Tenants sought adjournment on the basis that they wanted additional time to
prepare. The second review request also says they could not find all of their
rent receipts prior to the review hearing. 
18.  The
Member denied the adjournment on the basis that the review was brought by the
Tenants and the adjournment request was for the purpose of delay. In other
words, as it was their review request they knew the issues to be heard and in
the two weeks between filing the request and the review hearing, they had time
to find any receipts they needed. 
19.  I would
also observe that all Board notices of hearing explicitly warn the parties that
they must come prepared and to bring with them to the hearing three copies of
any evidence the party intends to rely on. 
THE NEW
RECEIPTS
20.  With
respect to the missing receipts that have now been found and attached to the
review request, the receipts constitute new evidence. At the hearing of the
review request the Tenants presented two direct deposit records as proof of
payment dated June 20, 2017 and July 20, 2017. The new documents also appear to
be direct deposit records but are not duplicative of the ones filed into
evidence at the hearing. There are four in total. 
21.  Not all
of the new documents are entirely legible but they appear to show deposits to
the Landlord’s account as follows: $800.00 June 30, 2016; $800.00 August 31,
2016; $600.00 November 30, 2016; and $400.00 December 13, 2016. 
22.  The
difficulty with this ground for review is that these deposit records all
existed at the time of the original review hearing. 
23.  Interpretation
Guideline 8 says in part:
Serious
error includes: 
…
• New evidence which
was unavailable at the time of the hearing and which is potentially
determinative of one or more central issues in dispute;
[Emphasis added.]
24.  The dates
on the deposit records all indicate this new evidence was in existence at the
time of the original hearing. In other words, the Tenants should have brought
it to the hearing with them. Their failure to do so does not constitute a
serious error on the part of the Board; it is a serious error on the part of
the Tenants and cannot be the basis for review. 
25.  I would
also observe that the deposit records are not determinative of the question of
how much the rent arrears owing are. I say this because absent additional
information, they do not really contradict the evidence of the Landlord as
contained in the notice of termination. 
26.  For
example, the deposit made on June 30, 2016 may have been intended to pay rent
for the month of July, 2016 but the receipt does not say that on its face.
Because the payment was not dedicated the Landlord was entitled to apply it to
any rent arrears due for the period ending June 30, 2016. Similarly, the
deposit made on August 31, 2016 may have been applied to rent arrears due for
the period ending August 31, 2016 and not September, 2016. Without additional
information, there is no way of knowing what month these deposits were applied
to or if they were applied at all as the Tenants seem to claim.
27.  As for
the last two deposit receipts, they total $1,000.00, which is the amount the
Landlord’s notice of termination indicates the Tenants paid for the period
September 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017. So those two receipts are wholly
consistent with the Landlord’s evidence before the Board.
28.  So the
part of the review request that is based on the new evidence cannot succeed
because the new evidence was in existence at the time of the hearing and does
not appear to be determinative of a material issue that was before the Board. 
29.  I would
also observe that the Tenants’ disagreement with respect to the amount of rent
arrears owing is an issue raised in the first request for review. Pursuant to
Rule 29.18 this second review request can only be based on different grounds so
is not properly before the Board for me to consider on this review request. 
30.  Given all
of the above, the Tenants’ second review request must be denied. I am not
satisfied that there is a serious error in the order or that a serious error
occurred in the proceedings.
31.  This
order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further
reasons shall be issued. 
It
is ordered that:
 
1.      The
request to review order TEL-80483-17-RV issued on August 1, 2017 is denied. The
order is confirmed and remains unchanged.
