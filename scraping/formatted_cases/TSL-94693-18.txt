Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-94693-18
 











 
 

S.M.D (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict C.A.R. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has
not paid the rent the Tenant owes and because the Landlord requires possession
of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on June 8, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant
attended the hearing. The Landlord was represented by S.S. Also present at the
hearing was H.D. (the ‘Landlord’s Brother’).
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
There is no dispute between
the parties that the Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from January 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.  Because of the
arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective April 15, 2018.
2.     
There is also no dispute
that the arrears of rent owing for the period ending June 30, 2018 total
$4,400.00. This amount includes a credit for the compensation payable by the
Landlord pursuant to s. 48.1 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’). 
3.     
The Landlord incurred costs
of $190.00 for filing the application and is entitled to reimbursement of those
costs.
4.     
The Tenant also does not
question that the Landlord in good faith requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of
residential occupation. 
5.     
But she does question who
the Landlord is as her tenancy agreement was actually between herself and the
Landlord’s Brother who lives in the unit above the Tenant’s rent unit. She has
had no dealings with the Landlord himself. 
6.     
As I explained at the
hearing, both the Landlord and the Landlord’s Brother meet the definition of
“landlord” under s. 2(1) of the Act which reads in part as follows:
“landlord includes:
(a)                        the owner of a rental unit or
any other person who permits occupancy of a rental unit, other than a tenant
who occupies a rental unit in a residential complex and who permits another
person to also occupy the unit or any part of the unit,
7.     
As the Landlord is on title
as the owner of the property he meets this definition. As the Landlord’s
Brother was the person who permitted occupancy of the rental unit (and
functioned throughout the tenancy as the Landlord), the Landlord’s Brother also
meets this definition. 
8.     
The Tenant also questions
whether or not the Landlord needs to move into the rental unit as he appears to
be around the property and living upstairs with the Landlord’s Brother. 
9.     
The Landlord says this is
not true although his driver’s license indicates his address is the rental
unit. The Landlord says he rents an apartment and wants to move into the rental
unit because of its location close to the lake, because it is his house and he
has never lived in it, and because it would mean he was living closer to his
brother. 
10.  
Despite the evidence of the
address on the Landlord’s driver’s license, I accept the Landlord’s testimony
that he does not live upstairs with his brother but rather lives in an
apartment across town. I say this because the Landlord’s testimony with respect
to the apartment where he now lives contained admissions against his own
interests. He acknowledges he has not given notice of termination to his own
landlord and is required in law to provide a minimum of two months’ notice
unless his own landlord will consent to terminate earlier. (No evidence was led
that the Landlord’s own landlord will do that.) That is an admission against
his own interests because he wants possession immediately and does not want the
Board to grant the Tenant the delay she seeks. 
11.  
Given all of the above, I am
satisfied the Landlord genuinely intends to move into the rental unit. 
12.  
The real issue between the
parties is the Tenant’s request for relief from eviction. The Tenant wants
relief with respect to the arrears of rent in the form of a repayment plan.
With respect to the application for Landlord’s own use she seeks additional
time to move, and asks that the eviction be delayed until September 30, 2018.
13.  
As I explained at the
hearing, pursuant to s. 82 of the Act the Board is mandatorily required to
consider all of the circumstances of both parties to explore whether or not
granting relief would be unfair. 
14.  
The Tenant has lived in the
rental unit with her teenage son since December of 2016. 
15.  
She says that in July of
2017 she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She had surgery but missed a lot of
work and her employment as a medical receptionist was terminated in late November
of 2017. 
16.  
The Tenant had insufficient
hours for Employment Insurance so in January of 2018 she applied for social
assistance (‘OW’). Her monthly income from OW is about $902.00 but she also
receives the child tax credit of $420.00 monthly. At some point in time she
picked up part-time work at $17.00 an hour for eight hours a week. As of the
beginning of this month her hours increased to 24 to 26 hours a week, mostly
working at home. 
17.  
In February of 2018 the Tenant
had more surgery due to a serious gallbladder attack. The Tenant’s health
continues to be a concern as her lymph nodes show signs of T-cell lymphoma. 
18.  
The Tenant says she does not
actually want to remain in the rental unit but needs additional time to find a
new home and move due to her circumstances. 
19.  
The Tenant says she can
afford to repay the rental arrears because of her new work hours and because in
July of 2018 she will be able to access a locked in income savings account that
has a balance in excess of $16,000.00. That testimony is corroborated by a
letter from the Tenant’s bank. 
20.  
The Landlord led very little
evidence about his own circumstances. He wants to move into the rental unit as
soon as possible but acknowledges he must give notice of termination to his own
landlord. If his landlord does not agree to early termination the earliest date
the Landlord could terminate his own tenancy for would be August 31, 2018. He
also says he has to pay the mortgage but acknowledges he has not defaulted on
payment. In the absence of the rent from the Tenant he has paid the mortgage
with other credit. 
21.  
Having considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act I find
that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the
conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of
the Act. 
22.  
The Landlord’s concern that
there is no guarantee the Tenant will comply with her proposed repayment plan
even if she receives the income she is expecting from her locked in savings can
be countered with a section 78 clause. If the Tenant does not make the payments
required the Landlord can obtain an earlier eviction order without notice to
the Tenant. In terms of balancing the fairness of the parties’ circumstances,
the Tenant’s very serious health concerns and the difficulties she will face
moving outweigh the Landlord’s eagerness to live in his own house. 
23.  
Given the above, the Tenant’s request for relief
is granted. 
24.  
This order contains all of the reasons for the
decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.


It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $4,590.00 for arrears of rent up to June 30, 2018 and costs. 
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord the amount set out above in paragraph 1 in accordance with the following
schedule:
(1) 
$1,000.00 on or before June
22, 2018;
(2) 
$750.00 on or before July
13, 2018; and
(3) 
$2,840.00 on or before
August 10, 2018.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord the rent due for the month of July, no later than July 3, 2018,
and the rent due for the month of August, 2018 no later than August 1, 2018. 
4.     
If the Tenant fails to make
any one of the payments under this order, the outstanding balance owing under
paragraph 1 shall immediately come due and the Landlord may apply under section
78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), within 30 days of
the breach, without notice to the Tenant, for an order terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenant on a date prior to September 30, 2018, and requiring
that the Tenant pay any new arrears and NSF fees and related charged that
become owing after June 30, 2018. 
5.     
The Landlord shall apply the
Tenant’s last month’s rent deposit to the rent due for the month of September,
2018.
6.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated, as of September 30, 2018. The Tenant
must move out of the rental unit on or before September 30, 2018.
7.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before September 30, 2018, then starting October 1, 2018, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
8.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after October 1, 2018.
9.     
If the Tenant does not move
out of the rental unit on or before September 30, 2018 then the Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord $32.88 per day for compensation for the use of the
unit from October 1, 2018 to the date she moves out of the unit.
