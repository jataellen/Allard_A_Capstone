Order under Section 69
and Subsection 87(1)
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 











 

TC (the 'Landlord') applied for an order requiring GB
(the 'Tenant') to pay the rent that the Tenant owes.  (L9 Application)
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has
also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for
the damage; because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered
with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlord or another tenant; and because the Tenant has been persistently late
in paying the Tenant's rent.  The Landlord also claimed compensation for each
day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.  (L2
Application)
 
These applications were heard in Barrie on March 29,
2018.   
 
Only the Landlord attended the
hearing.  I waited until 12:45 pm before calling this forward to be heard on an
uncontested basis.
 
Determinations:
 
L9 Application
 
1.     
 The Tenant was in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
2.     
The Tenant did not pay the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from October 1, 2012
to March 31, 2018.   The Landlord
submitted an L9 update sheet to confirm the accounting up to March 31, 2018.  
3.     
There is no last month’s
rent deposit.
4.     
The Tenant paid $1,080.00 to
the Landlord after the filing of the application.
5.     
Based on uncontested
submissions, I find the Tenant did not pay the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period from October
1, 2012 to March 31, 2018, and owes the Landlord $1,635.00* in rent
arrears up to March 31, 2018, which includes the cost of filing the application.
L2 Application
6.     
The Landlord withdrew one of
the bases for the application, namely, the claim relating to the Tenant being persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent.  In effect, this would leave the L2
application based only on the N5 notice of termination (exhibit LL#15) for
wilful and negligent damage, and substantial interference.  As this is not
prejudicial to the Tenant, I consented to this narrowing of the L2 application.
7.     
The Landlord submitted a
series of photographs (exhibits LL#1 to LL#11, all taken in October 2017) to
evidence his claim that the Tenant, another occupant or the Tenant’s dog caused
undue, wilful or negligent damage to the rental unit.  The photographs show
extensive damage including a smashed front door and glass, a smashed mud room window,
scratched/gouged front door and frame, scratched/damaged French doors, damaged
laundry room closet door, missing living room carpet, missing washroom vanity
and damaged wall, missing smoke alarms and a missing wall panel fronting the
electrical mains box.  The Landlord also stated the smell of stale cigarette
smoke permeates the unit.
8.     
The Landlord testified this
damage has been done over the past one to two years, and that the Tenant has
acknowledged the foregoing undue damage.
9.     
The Landlord testified the
Tenant and/or guests smoke in the rental unit (exhibit LL#10 – photo cigarette
butts) even though the lease (exhibit LL#14) clearly prohibits smoking inside
the unit.
10.  
The Landlord testified that
he has exchanged several emails and letters in 2017 with the Tenant concerning
the undue damage, the Tenant’s smoking and the removal of the smoke alarms, and
he submitted copies of the correspondence under exhibits LL#16 to LL#19.
11.  
The Landlord submitted two
separate, and very detailed quotations to repair and replace the undue damage
as summarized in paragraph 7 above, which also included cleaning, painting and
finishing.  The first quotation was from Servicemaster Restore (exhibit LL#12)
dated October 17, 2017 for $14,897.85 (HST included), and the second quotation
was from PuroClean Property Damage Specialist (exhibit LL#13) dated October 25,
2017 for $24,144.75 (HST included)
12.  
Based on the uncontested
evidence and testimony, I find on a balance of probabilities that the Tenant or
occupants (including the Tenant’s pet), caused undue wilful or negligent damage
to the rental unit.   The N5 notice of termination is consistent with the
requirements of subsection 62(1)(a) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the ‘Act’) and I find that the Tenant did not void the N5 notice as given
under subsection 62(3) of the Act.
13.  
I find that the Landlord
will incur costs of $14,897.85, based on the reasonable quotation contained in
LL#12, to repair the damage and/or replace property that was damaged and cannot
be reasonably repaired.
14.  
As well, I find the Tenant’s conduct relating to smoking
in the rental unit and the removal of the smoke alarms have substantially
interfered with the Landlord's reasonable enjoyment, and/or lawful rights, of
the rental unit.
15.  
Finally, I am sufficiently
persuaded to find in favour of the Landlord’s request for termination of the
tenancy in a final way, and I made this determination orally at the hearing.
16.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until April 30, 2018
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
L9 Application
 
1.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $1,635.00*, which represents the amount of rent owing up
to March 31, 2018 and the cost of filing the application.
L2 Application
 
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated, as of April 30, 2018. 
2.     
The Tenant must move out of
the rental unit on or before April 30, 2018.
3.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $14,897.85, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the
undue wilful or negligent damage caused by the Tenant.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $35.51** per day for compensation for the use of the unit from April
1, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
5.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before April 30, 2018, then starting May 1, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
6.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after May 1, 2018.
7.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing *** on or before April 30, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from May 1,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
