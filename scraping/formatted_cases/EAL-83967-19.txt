Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-83967-19
 











 

P.S.H. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict J.P. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Belleville on November
7, 2019.
 
The Landlord’s agent, C.S., and
the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from September 1, 2018
to November 30, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective May 2, 2019.
2.     
The lawful monthly rent decreased
to $197.00 effective August 1, 2019. 
3.     
Since the application was filed,
the Tenant paid $197.00. 
4.     
The arrears and costs owing to
November 30, 2019 total $2,830.00.
5.     
The Landlord seeks a standard,
voidable, eleven-day order. 
          TENANT’S REQUEST FOR RELIEF
6.     
The Tenant does not dispute the
rent arrears as claimed by the Landlord. She says her rental unit is a rent-geared
-to-income unit and that she has not been working so she hasn’t received money to
pay her rent. 
7.     
She seeks relief in the form
of a repayment plan where she would pay an additional $200.00 on top of the monthly
rent to clear the arrears for the next fourteen months. 
8.     
She says her total monthly income
is $816.00 which consists of Ontario Disability Support Program benefits just began
in November 2019 and her Canadian Pension Plan Disability payments. Her total household
expenses are $492.00 which is inclusive of the rent, food, car insurance premiums,
phone and cable bills. 
9.     
When the income and the expenses
are calculated, it appears the Tenant has $324.00 left over which is enough to meet
her commitment towards the repayment plan she has proposed. 
10.  
She says she has lived in the
rental unit for five years and is the sole occupant; she has been to the Board before
or arrears applications. She also suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, trauma
and fibromyalgia which limit her ability to work and maintain the rent. 
11.  
In the alternative, she seeks
a delayed eviction in the form of six months to find alternative living arrangements.

12.  
The Landlord opposes the Tenant
’s request for a repayment plan and the request for relief citing that it would
only lead to an accrual of further arrears. Moreover, the Landlord does not believe
the Tenant will be able to keep to her repayment plan as she has not followed the
in-house payment plan, she proposed initially, which led to the filing of the L1
application. 
          ANALYSIS
13.  
While I am concerned by the fact
that this is not the first time the Tenant has been before the Board for an arrears
application, based on the evidence before me I find the Tenant ’s request for a
repayment plan is reasonable and affordable. So, to give her the benefit of the
doubt, the repayment plan will be granted. 
14.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
15.  
This order contains all of
the reasons for my decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.   
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The arrears and costs owing to
November 30, 2019 total $2,830.00.
2.

$2,830.00 as follows:

2020;

3.     
The Tenant shall also pay
the monthly rent on or before the first day of every month beginning June 1, 2020
through to May 31, 2021. 
4.     
The Tenant shall pay the rent
for May 2020 in full and no later than May 6, 2020. 
5.

done so, the Tenant shall pay the rent for the months of December 2019 through to
April 2020 in full and no later than May 20, 2020.
6.     
If the Tenant fails to make
any one of the payments in accordance with this order, the outstanding balance
of any arrears of rent and costs shall become immediately due and owing and the
Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to the Board pursuant to
section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenant and requiring that the Tenant pay any new arrears, NSF fees and related
charges that became owing after November 30, 2019.
