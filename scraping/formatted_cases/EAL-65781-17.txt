Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-65781-17
 










 
 
 

M.M.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict J.C.
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Belleville on July 27, 2017.
 
The Landlord’s representative, Julie Bell, and the Tenant attended
the hearing. The Tenant was assisted by Duty Counsel at the hearing. 
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from November 1, 2016 to July 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective June 2, 2017.
2.      The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending July 31, 2017, total $4,275.00.
3.      The
Landlord incurred costs as a result of filing the application in the amount of
$190.00 and is entitled to reimbursement for those costs. 
4.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until September 30,
2017, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
5.      The
Tenant says that he started to withhold his rent because he was confused by the
many notices of termination he received. The Tenant also says that he bought a
stove for $1,800.00 to replace the allegedly faulty one in his unit and this
expense increased his arrears. The Tenant is on a very limited income but he
has applied for disability benefits due to his mental health concerns,
addiction troubles and physical disabilities. The Tenant is concerned that, if
he were to be evicted too soon, he may be homeless and have no place to live. 
6.      The
Tenant is seeking relief in the form of a lengthy 34-month payment plan during
which he would pay the monthly rent as well as an additional $100.00. In the
alternative, the Tenant is seeking relief from eviction in the form of delay
until September 30, 2017, to allow him time to acquire new benefits and attempt
to pay off the outstanding arrears, or find a new place to live. 
7.      The
Landlord sympathizes with the Tenant’s position, particularly since he has
lived in the rental unit for approximately 10 years. While the Landlord is not
agreeable to the 34-month payment plan, the Landlord’s representative does
agree that a delay until September 30, 2017, is reasonable, provided that the
Tenant be required to pay both August and September’s rent. 
8.      Based
on the evidence before me, I am satisfied that it would not be unfair to delay
the eviction until September 30, 2017. This delay should give the Tenant
sufficient time to either obtain disability benefits, or find a new place to
live. As a result, and in light of the Landlord’s right to receive August and
September’s rent, the order will be remedial in nature and will require the
Tenant to pay the arrears and any new rent if he wishes to void the order. 
It
is ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before September 30, 2017.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4,434.01*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to August 10, 2017.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $15.62 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting August 11, 2017 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before August
21, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from August 22, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before September 30, 2017, then starting October
1, 2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after October 1,
2017.
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $4,940.00 if the payment is made on or before August 31, 2017, or
ii)       $5,415.00 if the payment is made on or before September 30, 2017**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after October 1, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
