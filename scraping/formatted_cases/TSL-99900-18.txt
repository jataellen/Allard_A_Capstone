Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-99900-18
 











 
 

H.X (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict A.Z (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also
claimed NSF cheque charges and related administration charges (L1 application).
 
The Landlord also applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Landlord
requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date (L2 application).
 
This application was heard
in Toronto on December 4, 2018.
 
The
Landlord and the Landlord’s legal representative, I.M. S, and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
The
Landlord testified with the assistance of her friend, X.S, who interpreted
English to Mandarin for her.
 
Determinations: 
 
            L1application
 
1.      The Tenant has not paid the total rent the
Tenant was required to pay for the period from June 1, 2018 to December 31,
2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective September 13, 2018. 
2.      Although the Tenant stated he did not receive
any documents relating to these applications from either the Tenant or the
Board, his appearance today belies this representation. Accordingly, where the
evidence between the Landlord and the Tenant conflicts, I prefer the evidence
of the Landlord to that of the Tenant, generally.
3.      The Landlord alleged she incurred charges of
$12.00 for a cheque tendered by or on behalf of the Tenant, which was returned
NSF and $15.00 for related administration charges however she did not present
any record to corroborate the actual NSF cheque charge, though it was not
disputed the Tenant bounced the cheque for the June rent . Accordingly, I find
the Landlord failed to prove this part of her claim which must be denied.
4.      The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $700.00
from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
5.      Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenant for the period from May 3, 2018 to September 13, 2018.
6.      I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including the Tenant’s assertions he
withheld June rent because he did not receive a standard lease, which is no
excuse; he sent etransfers for rent for October and December using the same
passwords but in circumstances where there was no good reason the Landlord
would not accept rent payments if she could have, and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
L2 application
7.      The certificate of service provides that the
Landlord gave the Tenant and N4 and N12 notice on August 27, 2018 by handing
them to the Tenant however in somewhat confused testimony the Landlord said she
gave the Tenant the N4 notice in August 2018 and she gave him the N12 notice in
the middle of October 2018. The termination date on the N12 notice is October
31, 2018. 
8.      Subsections 48(1)(b) and (2) state:
48 (1) A landlord may, by notice, terminate
a tenancy if the landlord in good faith requires possession of the rental unit
for the purpose of residential occupation for a period of at least one year by,
(b) the
landlord’s spouse; …
(2) The date for termination specified in
the notice shall be at least 60 days after the notice is given and shall be the
day a period of the tenancy ends or, where the tenancy is for a fixed term, the
end of the term. 
9.      As the termination date on the N12 notice must
be 60 days after the Tenant is given that notice, I find the N12 notice is a
nullity by virtue of the failure to comply with the requisite notice period.
Accordingly, the L2 application must be denied.
It
is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out
below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant
must move out of the rental unit on or before December 29, 2018.
2.      The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,093.28*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to December 12,
2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $23.01
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting December 13, 2018 to
the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.      The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.      If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before December 29, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe
interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from December 30, 2018 at
3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If the unit is not vacated on or before December
29, 2018, then starting December 30, 2018, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
7.      Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord, on or after December 30, 2018.
8.      If, on or before December 29, 2018, the Tenant
pays the amount of $5,117.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy would not be terminated
and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this payment is not made in full
and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after December 30, 2018 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to
make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
