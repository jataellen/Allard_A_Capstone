Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-77480-17
 










 
 
 

D.L.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict A.H.
and A.B. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on March 8, 2017.
 
The following people attended the hearing:

The Landlord’s property manager, H.S. “E.” C.; 
The second-named Tenant; 
The second-named Tenant’s wife, F.H.; and
The Tenant’s interpreter, R.S..

 
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from January 1, 2017 to March 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective February 6, 2017.
2.     
The arrears of rent owing for the
period ending March 31, 2017, total $1,341.61.
3.     
The Landlord incurred costs as a
result of filing the application in the amount of $170.00 and is entitled to
reimbursement for those costs. 
4.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,445.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit is
owing to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2017 to February 6, 2017,
in the amount of $2.20.
6.      The
Tenants paid $2,294.75 after the application was filed.
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
8.      Only
the Tenant’s wife, FH, provided testimony on behalf of the Tenants. As the
hearing progressed, and in response to the Landlord’s testimony, it became
clear that FH withheld information from the Board, provided misleading
information to the Board and changed her version of the facts on several
occasions. 
9.      In
particular, FH admitted that she provided incorrect information to the Board
regarding who is currently living in the rental unit when she failed to mention
that her daughter’s boyfriend was living in the unit and is contributing to the
household income. She admittedly withheld information from the Board regarding
her monthly income and failed to mention that she receives $1,000.00 each month
from an inheritance. 
10.   FH
also admitted that she provided misleading information to the Board regarding
how she had fallen into arrears when she stated that her home had been “broken
into” at Christmas time, when in actual fact, her home had not been “broken
into” but her daughters friends had taken $5,000.00 from the home on two
separate occasions.
11.   FH
also provided inconsistent testimony regarding whether she would like to leave
the unit and how long it would take to find alternate accommodations. Near the
end of the hearing process, FH admitted that she could likely pay the
outstanding arrears within 11 days. 
12.    In
the face of FH’s refusal to provide the Board with accurate information
regarding who is living in the rental unit, the amount of her monthly income,
how she fell into arrears and how long she needs to find a new place to live,
and in light of FH’s admission that she is able to pay the outstanding arrears
within the standard 11 day time period as requested by the Landlord, I am
satisfied that it would unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act. 
It
is ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before March 21, 2017.
2.      As
of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation
the Landlord is entitled to by $1,139.38*.
3.      However,
the Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the
Landlord owes the Tenants:
$44.38 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting March 11, 2017
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit, and
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
4.      The
Landlord or the Tenants shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as
a result of this order.
5.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before March 21, 2017, then starting March 22,
2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
6.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 22, 2017.
7.      If,
on or before March 21, 2017, the Tenants pay the amount of $1,511.36** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
8.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after March 22, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
