Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 











 
 

OI the Landlord applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict MM (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes (L1 Application).
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has
also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for
the damage (L2 Application). 
 
This application was heard in Mississauga on February
13, 2018.
 
The Landlord's Agent, HS and the
Tenant attended the hearing.
 
At the hearing the Tenant raised
the following issues pursuant to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'): 
a)    Main hallway ceiling leak;
b)    Unit was not in a state of cleanliness when the Tenant moved in;
c)    Basement washroom leaks;
d)    Lack of furnace filter.
 
Determinations and Reasons:
 
            Rent owing
 
1.     
The monthly rent is
$1,800.00.
2.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from January 1, 2018
to February 28, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective January 17, 2018.
3.     
There is no dispute
regarding the amount of rent owing.
4.     
The Tenant did not seek any
remedy regarding the main hallway ceiling leak which has been repaired. 
Therefore it is not necessary to make any findings regarding this issue.
Cleanliness of unit
5.     
The Tenant said the unit was
very dirty when he moved in on December 3rd, 2017.  He testified
that there was drywall dust everywhere, the carpets needed to be steam cleaned
and the bathrooms were very dirty.  The Tenant said he paid to have the unit
cleaned including steam cleaning of the carpets and seeks reimbursement of
$423.75 representing the amount he paid.  The Tenant submitted an invoice dated
December 5, 2017 from Pro-Angels Maid Service Inc. to support the amount
claimed.  The Tenant also submitted photos of the unit.
6.     
The Landlord testified that
the unit was clean when the Tenant moved in and submitted a copy of the tenancy
agreement which includes a clause stating that the Tenant has had an
opportunity to examine the premises that that at the time of this lease, it is
“in good order, safe and tenantable condition”.
7.     
Section 22 of the Act
provides that a landlord shall not substantially interfere with the reasonable
enjoyment of the rental unit for all usual purposes by a tenant.  
8.     
Section 33 of the Act holds
a tenant responsible for ordinary cleanliness of the rental unit.
9.     
Based on the photos of the
unit submitted by the Tenant and the cost incurred to clean the unit, I am
satisfied that the Landlord substantially interfered with the Tenant’s
reasonable enjoyment by providing a unit that was not in a state of ordinary
cleanliness.  The photos show drywall debris on the floor, the bathtub is
significantly stained, there is dust on the laminate flooring and the carpets
are heavily stained.  
10.  
The Landlord’s submission
that the Tenant signed off that the unit was in good order is insufficient to
conclude that the unit was provided in a clean state.
11.  
The Tenant is entitled to
the out of pocket expenses claimed of $423.75.
Basement washroom leak
12.  
The Tenant testified that
there is a leak in the basement washroom as of January 9th, 2018 and
he told the Landlord the same day.  He said the leak is through the wall and
water flows onto the floor.  
13.  
The Landlord said he
arranged for the leak in the basement washroom to be repaired on January 6,
2018.
14.  
I am not satisfied that
there is a leak in the basement washroom. I find it improbable that the
Landlord would fail to repair a water leak in the basement washroom given the
likelihood of water damage to the rental unit.  The Tenant’s own evidence
indicates that he hired a plumber on December 12, 2017 to address a water leak
in the basement washroom.    This claim is dismissed.
Furnace filter
15.  
The Tenant has not
substantiated that a furnace filter was required.  He testified that due to
concerns with air quality, he inspected the furnace filter and discovered a
foam sponge instead of a filter in the furnace.  He submitted photos of this
“sponge”.  The Tenant seeks reimbursement of the $40 cost to purchase a furnace
filter.  He did not provide a receipt for this purchase.
16.  
The Landlord said the Tenant
did not report this issue to him.
17.  
A Landlord cannot be held
responsible for an issue he does not know about.
18.  
This claim is dismissed.
Relief
from eviction
19.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act and find
that it would not be necessary to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act because the Tenant said he could pay outstanding
arrears very quickly.
Regarding L2 damage application
20.  
On January 2, 2018, the Tenant was given a first
N5 Notice of Termination under section 62 of the Act.
 This N5 notice did not become void because the Tenant did not correct the
problem within the 7 day time period set out in the notice.
21.  
The issue to be determined is whether the Tenant
or a person whom the tenant permitted in the residential complex wilfully or
negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit.
22.  
The Landlord testified that
that cleaning company hired by the Tenant increased the temperature of the hot
water tank causing the pipe to burst and flooding the basement.  He said he had
to completely replace the laminate flooring in the unit.  The Landlord
submitted a letter from Reliance home comfort in support of his testimony and
receipts for the repair of the flooring.
23.  
Section 62 of the Act holds
a tenant or person whom the tenant permits in the residential complex
responsible for wilful or negligent undue damage to the rental unit or
residential complex.
24.  
Conduct is negligent if there
is a risk of damage which a reasonable person would take reasonable precautions
against (Bolton v. Stone 1951 A.C. 850).   There is not an expectation
that all possible risks will be avoided, but that reasonable precautions will
be taken to protect against reasonably foreseeable risks.  If a person
reasonably, albeit mistakenly, believes that there is no risk then the conduct
is not negligent (Beutler v. Beutler 1983 O.J. No. 505 at para. 148).
25.  
The Landlord has not
provided sufficient evidence to support a finding of wilful or negligent undue
damage.  It is evident that the basement flooring sustained undue damage. 
However, the evidence does not demonstrate that the flood was a result of
wilful or negligent conduct of the Tenant or a person permitted in the unit by
the Tenant.
26.  
The report from Reliance
states “relit pilot and added 2 holes at the bottom of the tank to allow water
to drain out of pan.  Advised customer if manually opened that is on them
tampering with tank; replaced TP valve”.  
27.  
The Tenant testified that
the Reliance technician told him that if he tampered with the tank, he would be
responsible.
28.  
This is consistent with the
content of the Reliance report.  In any event, the report does not state that
the Tenant or someone in the unit tampered with the hot water tank such that
the tank flooded the basement. The report does not state the reason for the
replacement of the TP valve and the technical did not attend the hearing to
provide evidence.
It is ordered that:
 
L1 rent owing application:
 
1.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $908.41*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to February 22, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes
on the rent deposit and less the amount for out of pocket expenses the Landlord
owes the Tenant.
2.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $59.18 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
February 23, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
4.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March 5, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from March 6,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
5.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 5, 2018, then starting March 6, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
6.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 6, 2018.
7.     
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $3,366.25 if the payment is made on or before February 28, 2018, or
ii)       $5,166.25 if the payment is made on or before March 5, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March 6, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
 
 
Regarding L2 damage application:
9.     
The Landlord’s L2
application is dismissed.
