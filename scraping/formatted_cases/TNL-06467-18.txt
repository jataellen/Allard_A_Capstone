Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-06467-18










 
 

AHL
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict KK and
AK (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe; and because they have been persistently late in paying the rent.  The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the
unit after the termination date.
 
This
application was heard in Newmarket on July 30, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord’s representative, SR, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from July 1, 2018 to July 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective July 4, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenants have also been persistently late in paying the rent.  Except in October
and November 2017, the Tenants have paid the rent late every month since August
2017.
 
3.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.  The Tenants did not attend the hearing to give
evidence of their circumstances.  
It is ordered that:
 
The Application for Non-payment of Rent
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids this part of the eviction order for non-payment of rent as set
out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The
Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before August 12, 2018.  Even
if the Tenants void this part of the eviction order for non-payment of rent,
the tenancy will be terminated as of August 31, 2018 for the Tenants’
persistent late payment of rent.
 
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $2,261.78*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to August 1, 2018.
 
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $70.68 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting August 2, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before August
12, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from August 13, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before August 12, 2018, then starting August 13,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after August 13,
2018.
 
8.      If,
on or before August 12, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $4,490.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this part of the eviction order for
non-payment of rent will be void.  This means that the tenancy would not be
terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit until August 31, 2018, when
the tenancy will be terminated for the Tenants’ persistent late payment of
rent.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this part of the eviction order for non-payment of rent if they pay
the amount required under that subsection on or after August 13, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.  The Tenant must still, however, vacate the rental
unit on or before August 31, 2018.
The
Application for Persistent Late Payment of Rent
10.   If
the Tenants void the part of this eviction order relating to non-payment of
rent, above, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated, as
of August 31, 2018, the date in the Landlord’s Form N8 Notice of Termination.
The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before August
31, 2018.
 
11.   If
the unit is not vacated on or before August 31, 2018, then starting September
1, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
12.   Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after September 1,
2018.
13.   The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $70.68 per day for compensation for the use
of the unit from September 1, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit; and
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
