Order
under Section 21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-03797-18-RV
 
 
 
Review Order
 
IPL
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict FZ and
AK (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe.
 
This
application was resolved by order TNL-03797-18 issued on June 6, 2018.
 
On
June 12, 2018, the Tenants requested a review of the order.
 
The
request was heard in Toronto on June 27, 2018.
 
The Landlord’ representative, D. R, and the Tenants’
representative, M. L, attended the hearing.
 
The Tenant’s representative requested an adjournment on behalf of
the Tenant on health grounds. The Tenant was granted a review hearing after
failing to attend the original hearing.  The eviction order has been stayed and
the Landlord would prejudiced by a further delay in the proceedings.  The
Tenant may participate in person or through a representative.  The Tenant now
has a representative and the issues are not complex.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      I
am satisfied that the Tenants did not have a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the proceedings on health ground, but there no error in the
order.
 
2.      The
Tenants do not dispute the arrears, but suggest that the Landlord returned the
Tenants’ rent cheques.  The alleged rent cheques represent small amounts and
are not material.  The ledger shows a number of cheques were returned for
insufficient funds. The order gives the Tenants the opportunity to void the
order by paying the arrears to the Board in trust.
 
3.      The
Tenants alleged that the rent claimed in the notice of termination is incorrect. 
The amount claimed is correct, as it accurately reflects the base rent plus
charges for parking and storage lockers
 
4.      The
Tenants requested a delay in enforcing the eviction to give them to void the
order. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to lift the stay of the order on July 16,
2018. The void the order the Tenants shall pay the arrears ordered plus the rent
for July 2018 and the Sheriff’s fee.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
request to review order TNL-03797-18 issued on June 6, 2018, is granted. However, the order is confirmed and remains
unchanged.
 
2.      The
interim order issued on June 12, 2018, is
cancelled. The stay of order TNL-03797-18 is lifted on July 16, 2018.
