Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-06020-18










 



 


 


 



 

MS
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict NAK
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes
(‘L1 application’).
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the
Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with
the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord
or another tenant; and because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying
the Tenant's rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date (‘L2 application’).
 
This
combined application was heard in Newmarket on July 23, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord, the Landlord’s legal representative, A.H, and
the Landlord’s son, SS, attended the hearing.  I was satisfied that the parties
had proper notice of the hearing.
 
At the hearing, I was informed that a person who identified
herself as the Tenant had contacted the Board’s call centre that morning by
telephone and advised that she was at the Hospital for Sick Children with her
daughter for an emergency and would be unable to attend the hearing.  No
further information was provided.
 
The Landlord opposed the granting of an adjournment of the
hearing.  According to the Landlord, this tenancy only began in June, 2017, no
rent has been paid for more than three months, and the amount outstanding is
$6,200.00, with the monthly rent being $1,800.00.
 
In considering whether or not to grant an adjournment, I consider
the prejudice to both parties.  I have limited information available about the
reason for the adjournment request or its authenticity or veracity.  The Tenant
did not arrange for anyone else to attend on her behalf and has communicated no
proposal that might explain how prejudice to the Landlord might be reduced or
eliminated.  There is no explanation as to whether the Tenant disputes the
amount of rent that is claimed to be owing or has a proposal for payment of
rent, either during the term of an adjournment, or toward the amount that is
owing.  The amount claimed to be owing by the Tenant is substantial.  Based on
current scheduling, a new hearing date would likely not be available in
Newmarket until late August or early September, by which one or two further
months’ rent would become due, potentially increasing the arrears to almost
$10,000.00.  This is not a large corporate landlord.  In these circumstances I
consider that it would be unfairly prejudicial to the Landlord to adjourn the
application, and I declined to do so.
 
At the hearing, the Landlord requested the consent of the Board to
withdraw their L2 application without prejudice.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     In
accordance with subsection 200(4) of the Act, I consent to the withdrawal of
the L2 application.
2.     The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from December 5, 2017 to August 4, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination.
3.     The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,800.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
4.     Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 6, 2017 to
July 25, 2018.
5.     No
circumstances were disclosed to me to support relief from eviction in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, (2006)
(the ‘Act’).
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The
Landlord’s L2 application is withdrawn without prejudice.
2.     Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before August 5, 2018.
3.     The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $3,805.80*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to July 25, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
4.     The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $59.18 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting July 26, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
5.     The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
6.     If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before August
5, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from August 6, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
7.     If
the unit is not vacated on or before August 5, 2018, then starting August 6,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after August 6, 2018.
9.     If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)       $6,390.00 if the payment is made on or before August 4, 2018, or
ii)      $8,190.00 if the payment is made on or before August 5, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
10.  The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after August 6, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
