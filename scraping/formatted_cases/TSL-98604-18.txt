Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-98604-18
 











 
 

J.A (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict L.Ss and E.T (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent
that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on October 1, 2018.
 
The
Landlord and the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
                        Rent
arrears
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid the total rent they
were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2018 to October 31, 2018.  The
Tenants paid $1,050.00 for the month of July but for the months of August,
September and October they have paid only a total of only $1,430.00. Because of
the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 22,
2018.
2.     
The Tenants paid $1,430.00 after the application
was filed.
3.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $100.00
from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
4.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenants for the period from March 1, 2018 to August 22, 2018.
                      Section
82 – Maintenance issues
5.     
At the hearing the Tenants
raised the following issue pursuant to section 82 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'): the Landlord failed to maintain the unit
contrary to section 20 of the Act.
6.     
The Tenants with their two young children rented
the basement unit of the residential complex beginning on March 1, 2018 for the
monthly rent of $1,050.00.
7.     
On April 16, 2018 the Tenant’s former basement unit
was flooded. In a message from the superintendent to the property manager dated
April 16, 2018 he stated the basement unit “is flooding bad and they want to
move into another unit it is bad.” And, another text message on April 18, 2018
described the situation: “they have no choice to move they cannot stay in that
wet hole, really they could have made Jack put them up in a motel room while it
was flooding and it still is. “
8.     
The Tenants were told on April 16, 2018 they could
move upstairs to unit number 6, which is bigger than the basement unit
consisting of 2 bedrooms with a balcony. They were initially told by the
superintendent the rent for that unit would be $1,200.00 plus hydro, but on
April 19, 2018 the Landlord insisted the Tenants sign a lease for unit 6 at a monthly
rent of $1,250.00 plus hydro before they move in.  
9.     
The Tenants painted unit 6 and moved into it at
the end of May but did not sign a lease for that unit. The Tenants were given a
credit of $350.00 that was applied to the June rent applicable to unit 6.  
10.  
The male Tenant said they had not budgeted for
more than the rent they paid for the basement unit. He said he was unaware that
the Landlord was obliged to perform all needed repairs pursuant to section 20
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2016. Believing he had no choice when
he was told to take the Landlord‘s offer or move out, he agreed to paint and
clean the basement unit and unit 6 for a temporary stay in unit 6. 
11.  
While they were in unit 6 the Tenants were
offered a new lease. The Tenants continued to live in unit 6 because within one
month of vacating the basement unit the Landlord had rented it. At the hearing
it was announced that the basement unit is again vacant. The male Tenant said
if it is inhabitable he is prepared to move back to the basement unit.
                      Analysis
12.  
As it is the Landlord’s responsibility to
maintain the rental unit, it follows that the landlord is responsible for the
reasonable expenses incurred when a landlord requires a tenant to move out of
their rent unit to perform maintenance: see for instance Order TST-96698-18.
Once the Tenants were permitted to occupy unit 6, the Landlord satisfied his
maintenance obligation to the Tenants. However, I am far from satisfied the
Landlord honoured his maintenance obligation to the Tenants from April 17, 2018
to May 31, 2018. The Landlord was obliged immediately upon being notified of
the flooded basement unit to either house the Tenants in adequate premises
without requiring them to pay extra money or to have to do work at the
temporary unit or pay the cost of their accommodation in a hotel or other
suitable premises while the basement unit was made fit for habitation.
13.  
Even though the basement unit was repaired over
the course of one month so that it could be occupied again by the Tenants, it
appears the Landlord was under the impression the Tenants had agreed to
continue to occupy unit 6 after the basement unit was made ready for occupation
at the monthly rent of $1,250.00 plus hydro whereas the Tenants expected to
continue in unit 6 at the monthly rent they paid for the basement unit upon the
Landlord renting the basement unit to other tenants.
14.  
I am satisfied the Tenants agreed to rent unit 6
at the monthly rate of $1,250.00 plus utilities, mistakenly believing they had
no choice. 
15.  
On the other hand, I find the Tenants are
entitled to a rent abatement equal to 100% of the monthly rent for the basement
unit which as the evidence from the personnel in the employ of the Landlord indicates
it was unfit for habitation for the 44 day period from April 17, 2018 to May
31, 2018. The per diem rate rent is $34.52 which amounts to a total abatement
of $1,518.88 ($34.52 x 44 days). The Tenants are entitled to set off $1,518.88
against the rent they owe for unit 6 as compensation for having to reside in a
wet unit for an extended period of time.
16.  
Now that the basement unit is available the
Tenants are entitled to return there unit where the monthly rent for that unit
continues to be $1,050.00. In the event the basement unit is not available for
the Tenants to occupy, the Tenants shall be permitted to remain in unit 6 at
the rent of $1,050.00 until the basement unit becomes available at which time
they can move back into it.
          Relief
from eviction
17.  
I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It
is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out
below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The
Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before November 3, 2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $602.57*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to October 23,
2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit
and less the amount of the abatement the
Landlord owes the Tenants.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$41.10 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from October 24, 2018
to October 31, 2018, and $34.52 from November 1, 2018 to the date the Tenants
move out of the unit.
4.     
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before November 3, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe
interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from November 4, 2018 at
3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
5.     
If the unit is not vacated on or before November
3, 2018, then starting November 4, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
6.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord, on or after November 4, 2018.
7.     
If the Tenants wish to void this order and
continue the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in
trust:
i)        $1,001.12 if the payment is made on or before October 31, 2018, or
ii)       $2,251.12 if the payment is made on or before November 3, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.     
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after November 4, 2018 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
9.     
The Tenants are entitled to return their former
basement unit, if vacant, where the monthly rent for that unit continues to be
$1,050.00. 
10.  
In the event the basement unit is not available
for the Tenants to occupy, the Tenants shall be permitted to remain in unit 6
at the rent of $1,050.00 until the basement unit becomes available at which
time they can move back into it
