Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: TNL-06600-18
 
 
 
 
 
SS (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict MB and BB (the Tenants')
because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on August 7, 2018.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord's legal representative, R. B, and the Tenant, B. Ba, attended the hearing.
 
 
 
Determinations and Reasons:
 
1.   The Tenants
have not paid the total rent they were required
to pay for the period from
December 1, 2016 to August 31, 2018. Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective August 21, 2018.
 
2.     The Landlord
is seeking a standard termination order.  The Landlord's legal representative said that the Tenant
has paid $300.00
less per month than the lawful rent since the end of 2016.  Despite having agreed to the lawful rent, and despite the Board determining that the lawful rent is $1,750.00 per month, the Tenant has persisted in paying $1,450.00 per month. The arrears
over the last two years are now over $6,000.00 so the Landlord is seeking payment
of the full arrears or eviction.
 
3.     The Tenant
said that the lawful rent is $1,450.00 and that is why the Tenants
have paid this amount every month.  Therefore, the Tenants
do not believe they owe arrears of rent.
In the alternative, the Tenant
said that the Tenants need at least six weeks to find alternative accommodation because the Tenant's sole source
of income is ODSP.  She lives in the rental unit with her husband, two children and disabled sister.  She suffered
a

work injury, and therefore receives
ODSP.  However, she is the only member of the
household who is paying the rent.
 
4.             I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of
the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act').  The Tenant attempted to argue that
the rent is $1,450.00, and that is why there has been a shortfall of $300.00 every month
for almost two years.  However, the Landlord presented an order of this Board, TNT-
93514-17, dated March 1, 2018, in which the Tenants argued that there
was an illegal rent increase.  The Board concluded that the lawful rent was
$1,750.00, pursuant to subsection 123(1) of the Act, in which a landlord may increase
the rent charged
to a tenant if the tenant and landlord
agree that the landlord will add a prescribed service. The Landlord took over all the costs of paying utilities
for the rental unit.  In order TNT-
93514-17, the Member
compared utilities costs over a period of two years, and found that the rent increase of $350.00, agreed to by both parties,
was completely proper.  This decision was reviewed, in order TNT-93514-17_RV, and the Member found no error in the determination of rent.  Therefore, I find the Tenants agreed
to the rent increase almost four years ago, and they even have an order from the Board, from almost five months ago, that should have left them with no doubt what the lawful rent is. I find that the Tenants owe the amount of arrears claimed by the Landlord.
 
However, because of the Tenants' very limited income
and family circumstances, I find
that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until September 7, 2018, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.             Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before September 7, 2018.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $5,758.22*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to August 21, 2018.
 
3.     The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $57.53 per day for compensation for the use
of the unit starting August 22, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before September 7,
2018, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from September 8, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated
on or before September 7, 2018,
then starting September 8,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.              Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after September
8, 2018.

8.     If
the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, they must pay to the
· Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)       $6,475.00 if the payment is made on or before August 31, 2018, or
ii)      $8,225.00 if the payment
is made on or before
September 7, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.            The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after September 8, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenants are only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
