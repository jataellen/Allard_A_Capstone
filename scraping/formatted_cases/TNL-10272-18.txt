Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-10272-18



 


 


 



 
HPBI C/O VRS (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict MMT (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on December 11,
2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, SZ
and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Also in attendance was the
Tenant’s spouse, AR.
 
Preliminary Issue:
 

At the hearing, the Tenant requested
     an adjournment because he wanted to raise issues pursuant to section 82 of
     the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), but he did not
     bring his evidence to the hearing. 

 

The Landlord was unaware that the
     Tenant intended to raise issues pursuant to section 82.

 

If the Tenant wanted to proceed with
     issues under section 82, he should have brought his evidence to the
     hearing. On the notice of hearing, it clearly states that if a tenant
     wants to raise any issues not in the landlord’s application it is
     important to bring the evidence to the hearing. 

 

The Board’s Interpretation Guideline 1 provides
     assistance in understanding if an adjournment should be granted.  In
     balancing the rights of the parties to ensure that the matters are
     resolved expeditiously and without sacrificing the rights to a fair
     hearing I am of the view, after hearing the submissions of the parties,
     that an adjournment was not warranted. The Tenant should have brought his
     evidence to the hearing. As I stated at the hearing, the Tenant could file
     his own application. 

 

I proceeded to hear only the
     Landlord’s application.

Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from September 1, 2018
to December 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective October 10, 2018.
2.     
The monthly rent as of the
date of the hearing is $1,868.10.
3.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,868.10 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
4.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2018 to October 10, 2018.
5.     
The Tenant owes to the
Landlord the amount of $7,622.40, which represents the arrears of rent to
December 31, 2018, and the Landlord’s application filing fee.
6.     
The Tenant has been living
in the unit for about 3 ½ years.
7.     
It was the evidence of the
Tenant that he could not pay the rent because he was sick because of bed bugs
in the unit. The Tenant claimed to be allergic to bees and insects. The Tenant
says that he had to throw out furniture because of the bed bugs. 
8.     
The Tenant is a real estate
agent and says that he has not worked for three or four months. Subsequently,
the Tenant said that he did work in the past three to four months and had an
income of approximately $2,000.00 per month. The Tenant says that he did not
pay the rent because he had expenses due to the bed bug issue. The Tenant’s
spouse works part-time and had an income of approximately $1,000.00.
9.     
The Tenant says that the
Landlord treated the unit for bed bugs but he still has bed bugs. 
10.  
The Tenant requested relief
and proposed to pay the rent when due, commencing January 1, 2019, plus $500.00
until the arrears are paid in full. 
11.  
The Landlord opposed any
relief and submitted that the Tenant’s plan is unrealistic given the Tenant’s
income. Also, the Tenant has not acted in good faith because he has not paid
the rent in four months. 
12.  
It seems to be that the
Tenant has been withholding the rent due to maintenance issues. The remedy for
tenants when there is maintenance issues is not to withhold the rent. Rather,
the remedy is to file an application with the Board.
13.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. I considered the
Tenant’s payment plan and it would take the Tenant approximately fifteen months
to pay the arrears. I find that the length of the plan in not reasonable and
the Landlord should not have to wait for over a year for the arrears to be
paid. Also, the Tenant had funds to pay the rent but did not pay even a token
amount towards the rent. As the Tenant has been withholding the rent, he should
have the funds to void the order. There was insufficient evidence before me
that the Landlord is in serious breach of the Landlord’s obligation. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before December
27, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $4,493.99*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to December 13, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes
on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $61.42 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
December 14, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before December 24, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
December 25, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before December 27, 2018, then starting December 28, 2018, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after December 28, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before December
27, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $7,622.40** to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after December 28, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
