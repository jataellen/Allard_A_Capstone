Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-78110-17
 










 
 
 

I.C.G.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict J.M.
and J.B. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard in Belleville on April 27, 2017.
 
The Landlord’s representative, I.M., and the first-named Tenant
attended the hearing. 
 
At the hearing the Tenant raised the following issues pursuant to
section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'): the
building has poor security, the Tenant’s car was illegally towed, the rental
unit has a flea infestation. 
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from January 1, 2017 to April 30, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective February 26, 2017.
2.     
The arrears of rent owing for the period ending April 30, 2017,
total $3,327.40.
3.     
The Landlord incurred costs as a result of filing the application
in the amount of $170.00 and is entitled to reimbursement for those costs. 
4.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,105.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from July 5, 2016 to
February 26, 2017, in the amount of $10.76.
6.      The
Tenant says that he has been withholding his rent for several reasons. First,
he says the security is extremely poor in the residential complex. Second, the
Tenant says that the Landlord illegally towed his car. Finally, the Tenant says
that his rental unit is infested with fleas. 
7.      For
the reasons that follow, I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities
that any of these alleged problems exist at the residential complex. 
8.      The
first difficulty is that, throughout every aspect of the Tenant’s testimony, he
frequently changed his account of events, he was evasive and sarcastic when
questioned, his testimony contained numerous inconsistencies and at times was
completely implausible. In short, I find that the Tenant’s version of events
regarding all three issues was not credible. 
9.      For
example, the Tenant says that the security is extremely poor in the residential
complex because all of the security cameras are fake. However, he could provide
no support for this assertion aside from an alleged conversation he had with a
former superintendent. Also, regarding the alleged flea infestation, the Tenant
changed his chronology of events at least 3 times during his testimony and
eventually claimed to have a limited memory regarding key details. In short,
due to the inconsistency and contradictions in the Tenant’s testimony, I find
him not to be credible. 
10.   The
second difficulty is that, although the Tenant provided the Board with some
pictures along with his testimony, those pictures did not support his position
on any of the three issues. 
11.   For
example, the Tenant says that the Landlord illegally towed his car and he
provided the Board with pictures which he says support his position. However,
the pictures are of a bare section of pavement which contains no signs to
indicate if parking is permitted and no indication that the Tenant’s car was
actually ever parked in this spot. In short, there is nothing helpful in the
pictures of pavement.  The Tenant also provided pictures of the alleged flea
infestation, but the pictures are only of the Tenant’s cats which appear to
have wounds on their ears. These pictures do not confirm the Tenant’s position
that there have been fleas throughout the rental unit for months. In short, the
Tenant’s pictures do not support his position on any three of the issues he has
raised. 
12.   The
third and final difficulty is that, although the Tenant provided the Board with
some documents along with his testimony, those documents do not support his
position on any three of the issues. 
13.   For
example, the Tenant provided a document to the Board which he said supported
his position that the Landlord illegally towed his car. However, the document
is actually a written warning from the Landlord which was placed on the
Tenant’s car. The document warns the Tenant that his car “has been parked for
an extended period of time” and the Tenant needs to park his vehicle “in your
designated spot or it will be towed”. In short this document does not support
the Tenant’s position that his car was illegally towed. The Tenant also
provided documents from his veterinarian which he says confirms that the rental
unit is infested with fleas. However, these documents merely confirm that the
Tenant’s cats were being treated with various medications that are used for
skin infections, heartworms, tapeworms and other conditions. In short, these
documents do not support the Tenant’s position that the rental unit is infested
with fleas. 
14.   Based
on the evidence before me, I am not satisfied that there the security is poor
in the residential complex, that the Landlord illegally towed the Tenant’s car
or that the rental unit is infested with fleas. The Tenant’s section 82 issues
are dismissed and the Tenant is not entitled to an abatement of rent. 
15.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
16.   The
Tenant is seeking relief from eviction in the form of either a payment plan
which would see the arrears paid off in 7 months, or a delay of 2 months so
that he can get his affairs in order and find a new place to live. 
17.   However,
if what the Tenant says is true and he has been withholding the rent since
February 2017, there is no need for a lengthy payment plan as he should have
the outstanding arrears ready and available to pay the Landlord.  Also, there
is no need to delay this eviction as the Tenant has admitted, if he is evicted,
he will move to the western provinces with his family. The Tenant says that his
father could take vacation time and help him move his belongings. 
18.   As
the Landlord has already been waiting at least since February 2017 for any rent
payments, I have considered all of the circumstances and I find that it would
be unfair to grant any form of relief from eviction in this matter. 
It
is ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before May 14, 2017.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $2,238.47*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to May 3, 2017, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $35.57 per day for compensation for the use
of the unit starting May 4, 2017 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May 14,
2017, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from May 15, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before May 14, 2017, then starting May 15, 2017,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 15, 2017.
8.      If,
on or before May 14, 2017, the Tenants pay the amount of $4,584.25** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after May 15, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
