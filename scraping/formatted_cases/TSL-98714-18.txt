Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-98714-18
 










 
 

M.F.I
(S.D), L (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict E.A (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on October 1, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative M.Z and the Tenant attended the
hearing.
Reasons:
Adjournment request
1.   
At the start of the hearing, the Tenant asked that the matter be
adjourned.  In making that request, she was represented by K.L, a lawyer.  Mr. Ladvised
that he had a limited retainer to represent the Tenant only in requesting an
adjournment.  
2.   
The Tenant sought the adjournment so that she could raise issues under
section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘RTA’).  Section
82 provides as follows:
82 (1) At
a hearing of an application by a landlord under section 69 for an
order terminating a tenancy and evicting a tenant based on a notice of
termination under section 59, the Board shall permit the tenant to raise
any issue that could be the subject of an application made by the tenant under
this Act.  
(2) If
a tenant raises an issue under subsection (1), the Board may make any order in
respect of the issue that it could have made had the tenant made an application
under this Act.
3.   
Mr. L explained that he had only recently been retained, and had not yet
had time to prepare the Tenant’s case respecting maintenance issues she wished
to raise under section 82.  He also argued that preparing this case will take
an unusually long time, because the Tenant intends to coordinate her claims
with those of other tenants in the complex, some of whom have special needs.
4.   
I denied the adjournment request.  Parties are generally expected to
come to their hearing prepared to proceed.  Section 82 gives the Tenant the
right to raise her own claims, but she was not prepared to exercise that
right.  Section 82 does not entitle her to delay the Landlord’s case in order
to bring her own case.
5.   
The Tenant is free to raise her claims by filing applications with the
Board.  Her claims will then be heard at a date when she is ready to proceed. 
There is no prejudice to her in dealing with the Landlord’s application on the
day that it was scheduled.  Rent arrears and maintenance are not related
issues, so there would be no efficiency gained by hearing the two cases
together.
6.   
If the Tenant’s case will take a particularly long time to prepare, that
is not a reason to adjourn the Landlord’s application.  On the contrary, it is
another reason to hear the Landlord’s application promptly, so that the arrears
issue can be resolved.  The Tenant will then have all the time she needs to
prepare and file her own application respecting her maintenance issues.
7.   
After I denied the adjournment request, the Tenant received advice from
Duty Counsel respecting the arrears application, and was prepared to proceed
with that application.
Rent arrears
8.   
Once she was no longer represented by Mr. L, the Tenant again sought to
raise maintenance issues pursuant to section 82.
9.   
I denied the request.  The Tenant’s lawyer had already taken the
position that she was not prepared to proceed on her maintenance issues.  It
would not be fair to either party to hear issues that they were not prepared to
properly address.  It would be an abuse of process for the Tenant to first seek
an adjournment because she was not prepared to advance her claims, but then to
advance them nonetheless despite having claimed to be unable to do so.
10. The
Tenant owes rent arrears of $2,608.05, and the Landlord’s filing fee of
$175.00.  She asked that the Board order a payment plan.
11. Pursuant
to section 83 of the RTA, I must consider all the circumstances to determine
whether it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction on the terms the
Tenant requested.  By way of circumstances, the Tenant testified that she is a
single mother and a full-time student.  I take her to mean that she has a
limited income and needs some time to pay her arrears.
12. Unfortunately,
the Tenant refused to be cross-examined on her testimony.  She insisted that
she should not have to answer the Landlord’s representative’s questions about
her income.  She maintained that position after repeated warnings that the
Landlord was entitled to cross-examine her.
13. The
right to cross-examine an opposing witness is fundamental to the legal
process.  Since the Tenant refused to be cross-examined on her testimony, I
cannot give that testimony any weight.  I cannot conclude, on the evidence
before me, that the Tenant is unable to pay her arrears immediately.  I have no
choice but to deny relief from eviction.
14. The
Tenant will have the standard eleven days to pay the full amount owing, failing
which the tenancy will be terminated.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before October 15, 2018.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $776.20*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to October 4, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $28.58 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting October 5, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
October 15, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from October 16, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before October 15, 2018, then starting October
16, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after October 16,
2018.
8.      If,
on or before October 15, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $2,783.05** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after October 16, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
10.   Due
to a potential Canada Post strike, the Landlord, upon receipt of this order
must give a copy of this order to the Tenants by a method set out in subsection
191(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, other than by sending it by mail
or courier to the last known address where the Tenants reside or carry on
business.
