M.S. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict B.A. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on April 15,
2019.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing. 
 
Determinations:
 
The Tenant owes the Landlord $5,890.00
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from December 20, 2018
to April 19, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective January 24, 2019.
2.     
The Tenant
is in possession of the rental unit. 
3.     
The monthly
rent as of the date of the hearing is $1,900.00.
4.     
The Tenant paid $1,900.00
after the application was filed.
5.     
At the hearing, the Tenant
did not dispute that as of that day he owed the Landlord $2,090.00, which
includes arrears of rent to April 19, 2019 and the application filing fee.
However, it appears that the Landlord applied the Tenant’s last month’s rent
deposit to the rent for March, 2019 when she should not have done that because
it was not the last month of the tenancy. Accordingly, the true amount the
Tenant owed as of the hearing date was $3,990.00. Since the hearing, another
month’s rent has becoming due. Therefore, the total amount the Tenant currently
owes the Landlord is $5,890.00, which includes arrears of rent to May 19, 2019
and the application filing fee. If the Tenant paid the rent for April or made
any other payments since the hearing, those payments should be deducted from
the amount owing in this order.
6.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,900.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
7.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 20, 2018 to January 24, 2019.
Section 83 considerations
8.     
The Tenant requested relief from eviction in the
form of a payment plan. However, based on the Tenant’s evidence about his
financial circumstances I find that a conditional order would not be
appropriate because I am not convinced that the Tenant can afford his suggested
payments.
9.     
According to the Tenant’s payment plan, he would
have the arrears ($2,090 - only if the last month’s rent deposit is accounted
for) and April’s rent ($1900) paid by May 6, 2019. This is a total financial
commitment of $3,990. However, the Tenant testified that the only money he had
as of the hearing date is $500, which he was prepared to pay the Landlord that
day. The Tenant testified that he is expecting to receive a $2,500 loan from a
family member on May 6, 2019. He also testified that he will be paid $3,500 for
his work in a construction project in two installments in the middle and end of
May. The Tenant testified that he has no other sources of income and no savings
because he recently spent all his money on his mother’s back surgery. The
Tenant testified that his monthly expenses total $2,440, including rent. 
10.  
The Tenant did not submit any documentation to
substantiate his claim that he will be receiving a loan on May 6th
or that he will be paid $3,500 in May for construction work. Even if I accept
that the Tenant will receive these amounts, I am still not satisfied that he
will have enough money to pay the arrears and rent he will owe on May 6th
when he will only have a maximum of $3,000 on that day. Further, the Tenant has
approximately $500 of other monthly expenses that he must cover out of the
money he has. Ultimately, I find that the Tenant cannot afford the conditional
relief he proposed. 
11.  
I am also not satisfied that a longer payment
plan would be appropriate because I am not satisfied that the Tenant has a
concrete source of income going forward. The Tenant testified that his only
current employment is the single basement renovation job that he is getting
paid for in May. The Tenant testified that he is hopeful that if he does a good
job his employer will hire him again, but this is not guaranteed. 
12.  
Accordingly, I do not find it appropriate to
extend the payment plan or continue the tenancy when it seems more likely than
not that doing so would result in the arrears increasing further. I do not
think that this would be fair to either party. 
13.  
The Landlord requested an order terminating the
tenancy on April 19, 2019. The
Landlord testified that she believes the Tenant gave her notice to terminate
the tenancy effective April 19, 2019 or the parties had agreed to terminate the
tenancy that day. The Landlord submitted text messages in support of her
position and she directed me to a particular text message from the Tenant sent
January 30, 2019. However, I find that none of the Tenant’s text messages
indicate that the Tenant was intending to move out of the rental unit on April
19, 2019. In his messages the Tenant provides conflicting information about his
intentions. Some messages state that he was intending to move out at the end of
the term of the lease but in others like his message from January 30, 2019 the
Tenant states “am not going anytime soon”. I note that at the hearing, the
Tenant testified that he did not want to move out.
14.  
Section 43 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”) sets out what must be included in a notice
of termination. That provision requires a notice of termination to identify the
rental unit for which the notice is given and state the date on which the
tenancy is to terminate. Since none of the Tenant’s text messages includes
either of these pieces of information, I find that they do not constitute a
valid notice of termination because they do not comply with section 43 of the
Act. Similarly, I cannot find that the parties agreed to terminate the tenancy
because the text messages do not reveal that there was a meeting of the minds
between the parties as to if or when the tenancy is to terminate. 
15.  
The Landlord testified that
if the tenancy continues she will be prejudiced because she has entered into a
new tenancy agreement for the rental unit beginning May 1, 2019. However, I
cannot order unconditional termination of the tenancy because 1) tenants are
typically given the opportunity to void an order flowing from an L1
Application; and 2) the tenancy does not automatically terminate on April 30,
2019 at the end of the one-year term because (all other things being equal) it
is deemed to continue on a monthly basis pursuant to section 38 of the Act.
Therefore, the Landlord entered into a new lease for the rental unit at her own
peril and any prejudice she experiences as a result is of her own making. 
16.  
Therefore, a “standard” 11-day order will issue.
Accordingly, I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act,
and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before May 10,
2019.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $2,420.65*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to April 29, 2019, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $62.47 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
April 30, 2019 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May 10, 2019, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from May 11,
2019 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before May 10, 2019, then starting May 11, 2019, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 11, 2019.
8.     
If, on or before May 10,
2019, the Tenant pays the amount of $5,890.00** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after May 11, 2019 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
