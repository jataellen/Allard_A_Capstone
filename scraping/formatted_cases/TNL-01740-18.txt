Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-01740-18
 
 
 











 
 
 
 

AP and JD (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict EW (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on March 6,
2018.
 
The Landlords and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
 
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent he was required to pay for the period from December 1, 2017 to March
31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlords served Notice of Termination
effective February 1, 2018.
 
2.     
The Tenant proposed a
payment plan of six months to pay up the full amount of arrears and the
application cost, plus the rent as it comes due.  He stated that he had
business problems over the last few months and was unable to pay the rent.  He
said that he needed a long payment plan to make up the arrears and costs
because it was such a large amount of money.  He wanted to stay in the building
because his sick mother lived there and he was better able to look after her
there.
 
3.     
The Landlords opposed the
payment plan.  They said that he had been late with the rent frequently over
the last year, and had stopped paying any rent four months ago.  They had paid
a lot of NSF charges because of the Tenant, and it was difficult for them to
pay the monthly maintenance charges and taxes for the condominium in which he
was living with no rent coming in.
 
4.      We have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find, due to the financial hardship on
the Landlords for the Tenant’s failure to pay, that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. 
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. 
The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before March 20, 2018.
 
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlords $5,612.12*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to March 6, 2018.
 
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $59.18 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
March 7, 2018 to the date he moves out of the unit.
 
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before March 20, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from March
18, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 20, 2018, then starting March 21, 2018, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlords, on or after March 21, 2018.
 
8.     
If, on or before March 20,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $7,390.00** to the Landlords or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March 21, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlords.
