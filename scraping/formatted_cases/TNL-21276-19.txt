Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-21276-19
 










 
 

JSI
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict JM
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes;
and because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on January 13, 2020.
 
The Landlord’s representative, DR, and the Tenant’s representative
(an occupant of the rental unit and the Tenant’s sister), KD, attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from July 1, 2019 to January 31, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective November 30, 2019.
 
2.      At
the hearing, the Tenant’s representative agreed with the Landlord’s evidence of
the Tenant’s rent arrears.
 
3.      The
Tenant’s representative also agreed that the Tenant has been persistently late
in paying the rent.
 
4.      The
Tenant’s representative testified that the Tenant withheld rent payments,
pending this present hearing.  The Tenant retained the money that he otherwise
should have paid to the Landlord.  The Tenant’s representative testified that
the Tenant is able to pay the full amount owing, including the Landlord’s Board
filing costs, within 11 days from the date of this order.
 
5.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $975.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 1,
2015 to November 30, 2019.
 
7.      The
Tenant paid $2,965.00 after the application was filed.
 
8.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act.  
 
9.      In
addition to bringing the Tenant’s account with the Landlord to a $0.00 balance
within 11 days, the Tenant’s representative testified that her income, and her
brother’s income, are sufficient to pay the rent on time.  The Tenant’s
representative explained that the Tenant had paid the rent late in the past, or
not at all, because the Tenant is often absent from the Province.  The Tenant’s
representative testified that, since she now occupies the rental unit with the
Tenant, she will ensure that the rent is paid on time.
 
10.   Although
the Landlord’s representative did not consent to relief from eviction, I find
that it is appropriate to grant relief in the form of a conditional order.  The
Act is remedial legislation, and the Tenant’s representative’s sworn testimony
shows that the Tenant’s household’s income is sufficient to pay the rent on
time.
It is ordered that:
 
The Application for Non-payment of Rent
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids this part of the eviction order for non-payment of rent as set
out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The
Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before January 25, 2020.
 
2.      As
of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation
the Landlord is entitled to by $286.52*.
 
3.      However,
the Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the
Landlord owes the Tenant:  $34.21 per day for compensation for the use of the
unit starting January 15, 2020 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit;
and $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.      The
Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as
a result of this order.
 
5.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before January 25, 2020, then starting January
26, 2020, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 26,
2020.
 
7.      If,
on or before January 25, 2020, the Tenant pays the amount of $3,235.15** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this part of the eviction order for
non-payment of rent will be void.  This means that the tenancy would not be
terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this payment is not
made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this part of the eviction order for non-payment of rent, if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after January 26, 2020 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
The Application for
Persistent Late Payment of Rent
9.      If
the Tenant voids the part of this eviction order relating to non-payment of
rent, above, the Tenant shall also pay the full rent to the Landlord on the
first day of each month for the period February 1, 2020 to January 1, 2021.
 
10.   If
the Tenant fails to make a payment under paragraph nine, above, , the Landlord
may apply under section 78 of the Act, within 30 days of the breach, without
notice to the Tenant, for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenant.
