Order under Section 21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-65659-17-RV
 











 
 

Review Order
 
TA (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict TB and FCF (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe (L1
application).
 
The Landlord also applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants because the
Landlord in good faith requires the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation (L2 application).
 
This L1/L2 application
was resolved by order CEL-65659-17, issued on April 13, 2017.
 
On April 26, 2017,
the Tenants requested a review of that order.
 
The Tenants’ review
request was heard in Mississauga on May 9, 2017.
 
The
Landlord and the Tenants attended the hearing. The Landlord was represented by
paralegal, SS. The Tenants were represented by paralegal, AV.
 
The
Landlord’s wife was a witness at the hearing.
 
Determinations and Reasons:
 
1.     
The Tenants were not reasonably
able to participate in the original hearing on April 13, 2017. There was a
conflict with a school exam and the Tenants arrived late after the hearing had
already taken place. The Tenants called the Board to say they were on their
way. However, their message did not reach the hearing Member.
2.     
The Tenants displayed a
genuine intention to participate in the hearing by calling the Board. Their
review request is granted and the L1/L2 application is re-heard.
3.     
The Tenants complied with
the interim order issued on April 26, 2017 by paying $775.00 to the Board in
trust on May 4, 2017. This amount will be paid out to the Landlord and is
credited to the rent arrears owing.
The Rent Arrears
4.     
When the tenancy commenced in
June 2016 the monthly rent was $850.00. A last month's rent deposit of $850.00
was paid the Landlord.
5.     
In November 2016, the
parties agreed to reduce the rent to $775.00 due to a reduction in laundry
facilities.
6.     
The current monthly rent is
$775.00. This is undisputed.
7.     
The Tenants have not paid
$2,325.00 ($775.00 x 3 months) of the total rent they were required to pay for
the period from March 1, 2017 to May 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a N4 Notice of Termination effective March 16, 2017.
8.     
The rent arrears are not
disputed.
9.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $850.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord. Since the deposit being held is now $75.00 higher than the
monthly rent amount, the Tenants are credited with the excess. It is applied to
the rent arrears owing. The parties agreed to this during the hearing.
10.   As a result, the Landlord now holds a deposit of
$775.00 and the rent arrears owing are $2,250.00 ($2,325.00 - $75.00).
11.   Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenants for the period from May 17, 2016 to March 16, 2017.
12.   Regarding the L1 application: I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be necessary to
grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenants
stated that they can pay the amount owing within 11 days.
Landlord’s Own Use of the Basement Unit
13.   The Landlord served the Tenants with a valid N12
notice of termination effective May 31, 2017.
14.   The property is a bungalow with two separate
units. The Tenants rent the basement unit. The Landlord resides in the upper
unit with his wife and three children ages 16, 15 and 10.
15.   The Landlord’s wife deals with the Tenants for
most of the matters involved in the tenancy. She is having surgery in the near
future for severe arthritis in her knee. Medical documentation was provided to
support this. She will require modifications to the bathroom to assist her
after her surgery. There is only one bathroom on the upper floor. The Landlord,
his wife and their three children share the one bathroom.
16.   The Landlord intends to return the property to a
single family home. He requires the extra space in the basement for two reasons.
One, so that there will be a second bathroom available for his family’s use;
and two, so his two teenaged sons will no longer have to share a bedroom upstairs.
17.   The Landlord provided documentation to establish
that one of his sons has autism. The shared bedroom arrangement between his two
sons is no longer working now that the boys are older and they need their own
rooms.
18.   The Landlord, in good faith, requires the rental
unit for his own use to accommodate the needs of his family. The property will
be returned to a single family home.
19.   The test of good faith is whether the Landlord has a genuine
intention to occupy the rental unit for his own use (Salter v Beljinac
2001 CanLII 40231 (ON SCDC), [2001] O.J. No. 2792 Div Ct). I find that the Landlord has this genuine
intention.
20.   The Landlord has provided the affidavit required by section 72 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) stating that he needs
the rental unit for his own use.
21.   The Tenants question the good faith of the
Landlord. There is no dispute that the landlord/tenant relationship has become
tense. The police have been called by both sides for various disputes between
the Tenants and the Landlord’s wife.
22.   The Tenants state that they have received six
N12 notices of termination over the past few months and two N4 notices. They
consider this to be harassment.
23.   The notices of termination that the Landlord
issued do not amount to harassment.
24.   The two N4’s are for the same rent arrears.
There was just one copy issued to each Tenant separately. The N4 notices were
only issued due to the undisputed rent arrears. There is nothing improper in
the issuing of the N4 notices.
25.   The six N12 notices really only amount to three.
Three N12’s were issued with one separate copy for each Tenant. There were
defects or deficiencies in the prior N12 notices. The last N12 notice issued
(with a separate copy for each Tenant) is valid and is the basis for this L2
application.
26.   The Tenants attempted to raise other issues
regarding harassment such as a parking issue. However, this issue was already
determined in a prior Board application (TET-72567-16) and cannot be raised for
a second time.
27.   There is no question or dispute that the tenancy
is problematic and the relationship been the Landlord’s wife and the Tenants is
no longer functioning. The Tenants claim that this is the real reason for the
N12 notices. However, this does not amount to bad faith. There is nothing
improper about a Landlord deciding that he no longer wants to rent his unit
anymore. As long as he genuinely intends to use the rental unit for his (and
his family’s) own residential use, the test of good faith has been met.
28.   The Tenants claim that they have had no heat and
hot water over the winter months. This issue was considered for the purpose of
determining whether the Landlord is in serious breach of his obligations under
the Act. Subsection 83(3)(a) of the Act states that the eviction application must
be refused if the Landlord is in serious breach.
29.   The Landlord is not in serious breach regarding
the heat or hot water. The Tenants have hot water. They just do not consider it
to be hot enough at times or sufficient in quantity for a long shower. The
Tenants also have heat. However, the upper unit controls the thermostat and it
is not always set to a temperature the Tenants would prefer.
30.   The Tenant argue that the Landlord gave them the
N12 notice in March 2017 because they called the City about the unregistered
basement apartment in February.
31.   Subsection 83(3)(b) of the Act states that the
Board must refuse the eviction application if the reason the application was
brought is because the tenant complained to a government authority about the
landlord’s violation of a law.
32.   It is important to note the wording used in
subsection 83(3)(b) of the Act. It states that the complaint made must be the
reason for the application not just a reason.
33.   The evidence does not suggest that the complaint
that the Tenants made to the City was the reason for the eviction
application. Prior N12 notices were given to the Tenants before the complaint
was even made. Even if the complaint to the City formed some part of the reason
for the Landlord’s wish to stop renting the basement and use it for himself and
his family, the additional reasons for the application are the need for more
space due to the changing needs of the Landlord’s children and the requirement
for a second bathroom for the family after his wife’s surgery.
34.   Regarding the L2 application: I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until June 30, 2017 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. The
Tenants do not want to move. They stated that they live on a fixed income and
rental rates have increased significantly in their area. This delay will give
the Tenants some time to organize their move. 
35.   However, this delay will only be applicable if
the Tenants pay the amount required to void the rent arrears portion of this
order. If that amount is paid, the last month's rent deposit would be applied
to the June rent.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Order CEL-65659-17, issued
on April 13, 2017, is cancelled and replaced by the following:
 
Regarding the L1 rent arrears application:
2.     
Unless the Tenants void the
L1 rent arrears portion of this order as set out below, the tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the
rental unit on or before May 23, 2017.
3.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $225.36*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to May 12, 2017, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $25.48 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting May 13, 2017 to the date they move out of the unit.
5.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the L1 application.
6.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing on or before May 23, 2017, the Tenants will
start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from May 24,
2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
7.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before May 23, 2017, then starting May 24, 2017, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
8.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 24, 2017.
9.     
If, on or before May 23,
2017, the Tenants pay the amount of $1,665.00** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction regarding rent arrears will be void.  This means that the tenancy would not be
terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If this payment is not
made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
10.   The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside the rent arrears portion of this
order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after May 24,
2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
11.   The Board shall pay to the Landlord the amount
of $775.00 together with any accrued interest. 
Regarding the L2 application:
12.   If the Tenants pay the amount required to void
the rent arrears portion of this order, then the tenancy will continue to June
30, 2017.
13.   If the unit is not vacated on or before June 30,
2017, then starting July 1, 2017, the Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $25.48
per day for compensation for the use of the unit to the date they move out of
the unit.
14.   If the unit is not vacated on or before June 30,
2017, then starting July 1, 2017, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
15.   Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord, on or after July 1, 2017.
