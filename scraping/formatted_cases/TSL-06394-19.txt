Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-06394-19










 

Z
C Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Z C and J A (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe (L1 Application).
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evicting the
Tenants because the Tenants have been persistently late in paying their rent.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the
unit after the termination date (L2 application).
 
This
combined application was heard in Toronto on August 9, 2019.
 
Only
the Landlord’s representatives, S. B and M. S, attended the hearing. The Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 Application – Non-Payment of Rent
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the
period from December 1, 2018 to August 31, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective April 26, 2019.
2.      The
Tenants are in possession of the rental unit. 
3.      The
lawful rent as of the date of the hearing is $1,985.00/month – $26.10/day until
the repairs to the hardwood floors in the rental unit are completed as ordered
in HOT-03452-18.  
4.      The
Tenants are credited with $2,166.60. This amount represents $26.10 per day from
May 1, 2019 to August 14, 2019.
5.      The
Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
6.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,985.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
7.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from June 30, 2018
to April 26, 2019.
8.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
L2
Application – Persistent Late Payment of Rent
9.      On April
16, 2019, the Landlord served the Tenant a Notice to Terminate at End of the
Term for persistent late payment of rent (the ‘N8 notice’) with a termination
date of June 30, 2019. 
10.   If find
that the N8 notice is in compliance with the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006,
it meets the 60-day requirement, and it provides sufficient details as of the
reason for the notice.
11.   On the
Landlord’s unopposed evidence, the Tenant has persistently failed to pay the
rent on the date it was due, as specified on the notice. In addition, since
this application for file that rent for June, July, and August 2019 remain
unpaid.
12.   I have
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
L1 Application – Non-Payment of Rent
 
1.      Unless
the Tenants void the rent arrears portion of this order as set out below, the
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before August 25, 2019.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $8,003.20*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to August 14, 2019, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $39.10 per day (includes abatement of
$26.10) for compensation for the use of the unit starting August 15, 2019 to
the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before August
25, 2019, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from August 26, 2019 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before August 25, 2019, then starting August 26,
2019, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after August 26,
2019.
8.      If,
on or before August 25, 2019, the Tenants pay the amount of $11,257.30** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, the rent arrears portion of this order for
eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit until August 25, 2019 when the tenancy is
terminated for persistent late payment of rent.  If this payment is not made in
full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside the rent arrears portion of this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after August 26, 2019 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
L2
Application – Persistent Late Payment of Rent
10.   If the
Tenants void the L1 application for arrears of rent above, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants is still terminated due to persistent late payment
of rent. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before August 25,
2019.
11.   If the
unit is not vacated on or before August 25, 2019, then starting August 26,
2019, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
12.   Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 26,
2019.
