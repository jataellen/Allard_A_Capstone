Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-04887-18
 
 
 











 

MP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict MAP (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges and
related administration charges.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on May 31, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, FQ,
the Tenant, and the Tenant’s representative, JH, attended the hearing.
 
 
 
Determinations and Reasons:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from February 1, 2018
to May 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective May 2, 2018.
 
2.     
The Landlord incurred
charges of $5.00 for a cheque tendered by or on behalf of the Tenant, which was
returned NSF and $20.00 for related administration charges.
 
3.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,216.73 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
 
4.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 15, 2018 to May 2, 2018.
 
5.     
The Tenant denied that he
owed a balance of $400.00 to the Landlord for the period January 1, 2018 to
March 31, 2018, as claimed on the Landlord’s application. He said that his
cheque for the April, 2018, rent was paid on time but was returned to him NSF
although there were definitely sufficient funds in his account to pay the
rent.  He had paid the Landlord for May, 2018, with a cheque, which the
Landlord’s representative acknowledged, but it had not yet cleared as of May
31, 2018.  The Tenant had a cheque for the June, 2018, rent with him to pay the
Landlord at the hearing.
 
6.     
The Tenant’s evidence was
that the Landlord is continually “pretending” that he is failing to make rent
payments.  He believes the Landlord has been harassing him, and is now
retaliating against him because he has made numerous health and safety
complaints against the Landlord.  The Tenant insisted that he has paid the
rent, in full, every month, and did not owe a balance of $400.00 prior to April,
2018.  With regard to April, he had proof that he had paid a cheque, dated
April 1, 2018, in the full amount of the rent, to GOL.  On the back of the
cheque it said to deposit to the credit of “MP”, the named Landlord on the
lease.  The cheque was returned NSF at the end of April, 2018, and the Tenant
said he had no idea why this happened.
 
7.     
In addition to the cheque
being returned NSF, the Tenant made out the cheque to the numbered company, GOL,
as opposed to “MP”, to which cheques had normally been made out.  According to
the Tenant, his “due diligence” led him to believe that “MP” was not a legal
entity.  That being said, he admitted that all his previous cheques,
particularly the one for the March, 2018, rent made out to “MP” had cleared and
been credited to him.  The Tenant maintained that he paid the April, 2018, rent
in full, and on time, and he did not know why the bank returned the cheque.
 
8.     
The Landlord presented a
ledger that showed there was a balance of $400.00 owing by the Tenant to the
Landlord that had occurred at some point in February, 2018.  Although the
Tenant accused the Landlord of failing to credit him with payments that had
been made by him directly, or by the Ministry of Community and Social Services
(that paid a portion of his rent) on his behalf, he produced no evidence of a
payment made by either him, or the Ministry of Community and Social Services
that had not been credited to his rental account.  On a balance of
probabilities, I find the Landlord’s evidence more credible on this point. 
There was a $400.00 debt owing to the Landlord from the Tenant for the period
January 1, 2018, to March 31, 2018.
 
9.     
Although the Tenant said he
had no idea why the rent cheque for April, 2018, was returned to him, his own
evidence, corroborated by that of the Landlord’s representative, suggests that
the cheque was made out to the wrong name.  The Landlord’s representative
explained that “MP” is the Landlord, and GI. is the property manager, and a
cheque made out in either name would clear with no problem.  The Tenant himself
admitted that all his previous cheques made out to “MP” had cleared into the “MP”
account with no problem.  Thus, he was in default for the April, 2018, rent.  Under
the circumstances, the Landlord suspects that the Tenant intentionally made out
the May, 2018, rent cheque in the wrong name, as well, suggesting that this would
be the reason that May’s rent payment had not yet been credited to the Tenant.
 
10.  
Based on the evidence before
me, I find that the Tenant failed to pay rent for the months of April and May,
2018.  As the Tenant owed a balance of $400.00 from early in 2018, and because
he owed the April and May, 2018, rent, the Landlord was entitled to file their
application, and also entitled to their $190.00 cost of filing their
application.
 
11.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), in particular, that the Tenant has stated
that he has the funds to pay what he owes.  The only reason he is in default on
his rent is because he has made out his rent cheques in the wrong name, and it
is not related to financial hardship in paying the rent.  Consequently, I find
that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before June 23,
2018.
 
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $2,150.27*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to June 12, 2018 and the total charges related to an NSF cheque tendered to
the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant, less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $40.16 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
June 13, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 23, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June 24,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 23, 2018, then starting June 24, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 24, 2018.
 
8.     
If, on or before June 23,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $4,279.80** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after June 24, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
