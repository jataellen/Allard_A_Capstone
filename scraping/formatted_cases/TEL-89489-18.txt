A.C.C. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict F.H. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.  This is an L1 application.
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because she has been persistently late in
paying her rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date.  This is an L2 application.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on April 23,
2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, S.H.,
and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent she was required to pay for the period from January 1, 2018 to April
30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective March 2, 2018.
2.    
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,125.63 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
3.    
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2018 to March 2, 2018.
4.    
The Tenant paid $2,000.00
after the application was filed.
5.    
The parties consented to
an order with standard terms regarding the non-payment of rent portion of this
application and the Tenant will pay the amount owed on or before April 30,
2018.  
APPLICATION FOR PERSISTENTLY LATE RENT
6.     
I am satisfied that the
Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
7.    
The Landlord submitted a
copy of the ledger, a list of dates notices of termination for non-payment of
rent were served on the Tenant and a list of previous applications before the
Board for rent for this tenancy.
8.    
The following are the
previous applications the Landlord filed with the Board prior to this
application: TEL-00956-09; TEL-07186-10; TEL-18159-11; TEL-25142-12;
TEL-28202-12; and TEL-69341-16.
9.    
The ledger shows the Tenant
has paid her rent late twelve times in the last year.  
10.  The Tenant stated that she began to have
financial issues eight or nine years ago when she separated from her husband. 
She is currently unemployed, but she has a part time job she believes is
available for her soon.  The Tenant stated the employer just requires a Police
check.  The Tenant admittedly did not apply for the Police check until recently
when the employer asked for it last month.
11.  The Tenant claimed the part time job is
approximately four to six hours a day, five days at week at $15.50 an hour
wage.  
12.  The Tenant further claimed that she would also
be relying on her pension to ensure payments are made on the first of every
month.  
13.  The Tenant is requesting to remain in the rental
unit and have a pay on time order in place.
14.  The issue with the Tenant’s request is that the
Tenant led insufficient evidence to persuade the Board that her behaviour will
change from the pattern indicated by the previous applications and late
payments as presented by the Landlord.  For this reason, the tenancy is
terminated.
15.  The Tenant requested a delay of the termination
by three months.  The Tenant’s reasoning for the delay is that she has to
gather first and last month’s rent.  The Landlord objected to the delay as it
would be prejudicial to the Landlord.  I am in agreement with the Landlord.  
16.  Since the termination date set out in the notice
of termination for persistently late payment of rent is May 31, 2018, I find further
delay of the termination would be unreasonable given the Tenant’s history of
late payments and non-payment.
17.  I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
18.  This order contains all of the reasons for the
decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued. 
It is ordered that:
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT (on consent)
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the non-payment
of rent portion of this order as set out below, the tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before April 30, 2018.
2.    
As of the date of this
order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the Landlord is
entitled to by $541.96*.
3.    
However, the Landlord is
authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the Landlord owes
the Tenant: 
•       
$37.01 per day for
compensation for the use of the unit starting April 26, 2018 to the date the
Tenant moves out of the unit, and 
•       
$190.00 for the cost of
filing the application.
4.    
The Landlord or the Tenant
shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before April 30, 2018, then starting May 1, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
6.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 1, 2018.
7.    
If, on or before April 30,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $955.77** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.    
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after May 1, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
 
APPLICATION FOR PERSISTENTLY LATE RENT
9.    
If the Tenant voids the
order with regards to non-payment of rent as ordered above, the following shall apply:
10.  
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated, as of May 31, 2018. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before May 31, 2018.
11.  
If the unit is not vacated on
or before May 31, 2018, then starting June 1, 2018, the Landlord may file this
order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
12.  
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after June 1, 2018.
