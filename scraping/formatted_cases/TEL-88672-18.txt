Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-88672-18
 










 
 
 

P.
A. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict M.
C. M. and P. W-T.(the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on March 21, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenants attended the hearing.
The
Landlord was represented by P. A..
 
Determinations:
 
1.      There
is no dispute between the parties that the Tenants have not paid the total rent
they were required to pay for the period from January 15, 2018 to April 14,
2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective January 30, 2018.
2.      As
of the date of the hearing the arrears of rent owing for the period ending
April 14, 2018 total $6,025.00. 
3.      There
is also no dispute that the Landlord incurred costs of $175.00 for filing the
application and is entitled to an order reimbursing those costs.
4.      The
only real dispute here is the Tenants’ request for relief from eviction
pursuant to s. 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') in
the form of a repayment plan. The Tenants want an opportunity to retain their
tenancy by paying to the Landlord the amount outstanding. 
5.      As
I explained at the hearing, the issue under section 83 of the Act is whether or
not it would be unfair in all of the circumstances to grant the relief sought.
That involves a balancing of both parties’ interests. 
6.      The
Tenants moved in together on May 15, 2017. Prior to moving into the rental unit
they lived apart. There are three children living in the unit aged 8, 18 and
23. The monthly rent is $1,950.00. The older children both seem to have
part-time jobs but their income is not considered household income. 
7.      Both
Tenants are self-employed. The second-named Tenant above says he used to
operate a gym. The gym closed in November or December of 2017 but he still has
some private clients and that produces an income of about $2,100.00. 
8.      In
addition, he works with the first-named Tenant above helping out with her
business. According to the Tenants she is a retail vendor at trade shows. She
also had a retail outlet or shop but that closed in January of 2018. According
to the Tenants, during the high season for outdoor shows they can earn as much
as $6,000.00 to $15,000.00 a month but that did not happen in 2017 and they can
offer no explanation as to why. As of the date of hearing this business had
produced no income since September of 2017. The month of the hearing before the
Board the Tenants applied for Ontario Works. The first-named Tenant above still
owes money to suppliers for product. 
9.      The
difficulty with the Tenants’ request for relief is that it is based on hope and
not evidence. They offer a payment plan they say they can comply with based on
income that may or may not materialise. Given that the Tenants were confident
about their business producing income in 2017 and it did not, it is not
reasonable to accept their assertions that somehow this year will be better. It
may be but it may not be and right now their income is insufficient to pay new
rent on an ongoing basis let alone repay the rent arrears owing. As a result,
it would be most unfair to the Landlord to grant the relief sought. I find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1)
of the Act beyond the Board’s standard voidable eviction order.
10.   The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,950.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord. If the Tenants do not void the
eviction order, this amount shall be applied to the rent due for the last month
of the tenancy pursuant to s. 106(10) of the Act.
11.   Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from May 16, 2017 to
January 30, 2018 totalling $25.11. If the Tenants do not void the eviction
order this amount shall also be applied to the rent arrears outstanding. 
12.   This
order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further
reasons shall be issued.
It
is ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before May 11, 2018.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $4,820.54*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to April 30, 2018, less any monies paid since
the hearing, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $64.11 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting May 1, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May 11,
2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from May 12, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before May 11, 2018, then starting May 12, 2018,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 12, 2018.
8.      If,
on or before May 11, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $7,975.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust (less any amounts paid since the hearing
before the Board), this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after May 12, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
