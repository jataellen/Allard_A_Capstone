Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-90721-17
 
 
 
#.B.C.H.I
(the 'Landlord') applied, to the Landlord and Tenant Board (the “Board”), for
an order to terminate the tenancy and evict A.S (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on February 20, 2018.
 
The
Landlord was represented by D.C, licensed paralegal. The Tenant attended the
hearing and was self-represented.
 
It is determined that:
 
Preliminary Matters
 
Letters From Other Tenants of the Complex
 
1.      The Tenant sought to
rely on some hearsay evidence in the form of four letters from other tenants of
the residential complex, who did not attend the hearing to provide oral
testimony. The Tenant explained the said four tenants could not attend due to
work commitments. Witnesses regularly provide testimony in Board proceedings via
telephone. No explanation was provided going to why the four tenants could not
take time off work to attend the hearing or participate via telephone
and it does not appear the Tenant requested a summons to compel their
attendance. In my view, a reasonable explanation was not provided why the four
tenants did not attended the hearing, either in person or by teleconference.
2.      Hearsay evidence is
admissible in Board proceedings, but considering that the authors of
the letters
were not available to be cross-examined on their statements, no reasonable
explanation was provided why the individuals were unavailable to testify in
person or by telephone and the letters were not in the form of a sworn
affidavit, the letters had minimal evidentiary value and were given no weight. With
disputed hearsay evidence, credibility is a central issue and the necessity for
cross-examination is intensified. Basic fairness and natural justice requires
that evidence of this nature be assessed in light of there being no opportunity
to cross-examine; this is especially so when the document at issue is being
heavily relied upon to seek the relief requested and the opposing side is
denied the right of cross-examination.
Service
of the Notice of Rent Increase (the “NORI”)
3.      The
arrears claimed in this application arise from the Tenant’s failure to pay a statutory
rent increase in 2016. The Tenant’s position is that the N4 notice is invalid as
it does not state the lawful rent because she was not served with a NORI raising
the monthly rent to $1,243.58, effective September 1, 2016.
4.      The Act and the
Board’s Rules require a landlord to provide a tenant with documents, including
NORIs, and if they are served in accordance with the Act and Rules they are
deemed to have been served whether the tenant receives them or not. It is only
when documents are not served in accordance with one of the permissible methods
set out in subsection 191(1) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
(the 'Act') or
Rule 5 that a landlord must prove the tenant actually received them (pursuant
to subsection 191(2) of the Act). Here, the Landlord’s evidence is that the
NORI was served to the Tenant by JH, on May 28, 2016, in accordance with
one of the permissible methods set out in subsection 191(1) of the Act. For the
reasons that follow, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the NORI was
served to the Tenant on May 28, 2016 and, therefore, the N4 notice
of termination served to the Tenant on October 31, 2017, is valid.
5.      On any
application before the Board the party making an allegation has the onus of
proving that allegation on a balance of probabilities. That means the Landlord
here must lead sufficient evidence to establish it is more likely than not the NORI was served to
the Tenant on May 28, 2016.
6.      On a balance of
probabilities means that the Landlord must show that its version of events is
the more probable and should succeed. Saying something is proven on a balance
of probabilities simply means that it is more likely than not to have occurred.
It means that it is probable, i.e., the probability that some event happened is
more than 50%--indeed, 50.1% is sufficient. In all cases, the decision maker
must weigh up the evidence and decide which version is most probably true.
Consequently, the real truth may never be known. All that can be done is to
decide which of the parties has presented the most probable version.
7.      Further, as the
Supreme Court of Canada stated in F. H. v. McDougall, 2008 SCC 53 (“F.
H. v. McDougall”), at paragraph 46, the civil standard of proof requires
that evidence “must always be sufficiently clear, convincing and cogent to
satisfy the balance of probabilities test.” Here, in my view, the Landlord’s
evidence has met the required standard. 
8.      JH, the
superintendent of the complex for the past four years, testified she served the
NORI to the Tenant on or about 12 p.m. on May 28, 2016, by placing the document
under the door to the unit. The Landlord provided a Notice of Rent Increase
(Serving List) (the “Serving List”), completed by JH for May 28, 2016, which JH
testified she completed upon serving the NORI to the Tenant. The said Serving
List bears JH’s signature and indicates JH only served one NORI on May 28th—that
served to the Tenant.
9.      The Tenant
testified she was home all day on May 28, 2016 and was able to so recall
because she was sick and unable to go outdoors. Further, the Tenant recalls she
was working on a university research paper at home as she was too ill to go to
the library.
10.   On
cross-examination the Tenant acknowledged she was served with a NORI by the
Landlord for a rent increase in 2017 and signed the Landlord’s Serving List in
this connection. The Tenant further acknowledged she was served with a NORI for
a rent increase in 2015. The Tenant was asked if there would be any benefit to
the Landlord in failing to serve her with a NORI for 2016, and the Tenant
stated there would be no benefit. 
11.   As
stated above, when a landlord serves a document to a tenant in
accordance with one of the permitted methods set out in subsection 191(1) of
the Act or Rule 5 of the Board’s Rules, there is no concomitant obligation
on the Landlord to prove the tenant actually received the document. Rule 5.1 d.
lists one of the permissible methods of service of a document as follows:  “for service on a person who occupies the rental unit, by placing
it under the door of the unit or through a mail slot in the door.” If a
Landlord opts for this method of service there is
no requirement the landlord knock on the door of the unit to ascertain if the
tenant is home and/or received the document being served. Indeed, if such was
required, then the landlord would, in essence, be effecting personal service
upon the tenant, which is another and different permissible method of service,
as the landlord might as well simply hand the document to the tenant. By allowing
a landlord to place the document under the door of the unit or through a mail
slot in the door, Rule 5.1 d. allows the landlord to discharge her/his
obligation in that fashion with no other conditions attached.
12.   With respect to what
transpired on May 28, 2016, I have no reason to prefer JH’s version of facts
over AS’s version. However, JH’s testimony, which testimony was corroborated by
the Serving List and copy of the NORI at issue, was certainly superior to that
of the Tenant, who, as stated, testified she was home all day on May 28th.
So, while I believe the Tenant was home on May 28th, I also believe
JH placed the NORI under the door to the unit on that date. This is especially
so as, while the Tenant was given an clear opportunity to cross-examine JH, the
witness’s testimony remained unshaken and uncontradicted, both internally and
vis-à-vis the documentary evidence provided—that is the Serving List and the
copy of the NORI served to the Tenant on May 28th.
13.   For the above
reasons, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the NORI was served to the
Tenant as JH testified on May 28th and, therefore,
the N4 notice of termination served to the Tenant on October 31, 2017, is valid
and the current lawful monthly rent is $1,243.58.
The
Landlord’s Application
1.      The
Tenant has not paid $329.16 of the total rent the Tenant was required to pay
for the period from September 1, 2016 to February 28, 2018. Because of the
arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination.
2.      The
Tenant also owes the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
3.      The
total amount owing to February 28, 2018 is $519.16 ($329.16 + $190.00).
4.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find
that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the
conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of
the Act. In particular, no evidence was presented the parties have, in the
past, been before the Board in connection with any issues arising out of the
tenancy and, further, the Tenant made significant payments to the Landlord
after the application was filed.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
Tenant shall pay the Landlord $519.16 as follows:
      
      a) $173.05, on or before March 15, 2018;
             
b) $173.05, on or before April 15, 2018; and
            
c) $173.06, on or before May 16, 2016.
2.      The Tenant
shall also pay the Landlord rent owing for the month of March, 2018 no later
than March 10, 2018.
3.      The Tenant
shall also pay the Landlord rent owing for the months of April, 2018 and May,
2018 no later than the first day of the month.
4.      If
the Tenant fails to make any one of the payments in accordance with this order,
the outstanding balance of any arrears of rent and costs to be paid by the
Tenant to the Landlord pursuant to paragraphs 1, 2 or 3 of this order shall
become immediately due and owing and the Landlord may, without notice to the
Tenant apply to the Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order
terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant and requiring that the Tenant
pay any new arrears, NSF fees and related charges that became owing after February
28, 2018.
