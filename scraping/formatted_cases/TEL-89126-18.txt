L.P
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict J-B.J.
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Whitby on April 13, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, C.A., and the Tenant attended the
hearing. 
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from January 21, 2018 to April 20, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective February 22, 2018.
2.      The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending April 30, 2018, total $5,760.00.
3.      The
Landlord incurred costs as a result of filing the application in the amount of
$175.00 and is entitled to reimbursement for those costs. 
4.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). The
circumstances here are most unfortunately. The Tenant lives in the unit with
his wife and 4 children, ages 18, 9, 8 and newborn. They have lived in the
rental unit since 2014. 
5.      The
Tenant entered into a “rent to own” agreement with the Landlord and paid a
substantial deposit as part of that agreement. Also as part of that agreement,
the Tenant has been paying extra money each month that has accumulated to
approximately $14,000.00. 
6.      The
Tenant lost his job in December 2017 and he thought he could continue to pay
his rent by deducting money each month from those accumulated funds. The Tenant
requested that the Board order the Landlord to offset the outstanding arrears
from these funds, but I explained to the Tenant that the Board has no
jurisdiction over the rent-to-own agreement and no power to offset those funds.

7.      The
Tenant says that he needs 2 months to find a new place to live. He and his
family have established a home for themselves over the last four years; the
children attend school in the area, they are accustomed to their surroundings
and it will be a major undertaking to move all of the belongings they have
accumulated over the last 4 years. 
8.      The
Tenant says that he expects to become employed shortly, but he provided no
evidence to the Board in support of his testimony. 
9.      The
Landlord’s representative says that the arrears are already substantial and
there is no guarantee that the Tenant can continue to afford the rental unit.
Despite having paid a deposit towards the rent-to-own agreement, the Tenant did
not pay a last month’s rent deposit which means that any delay that is granted
by the Board may possibly lead the arrears to accumulate. 
10.   Based
on all of the circumstances, I find that it would not be unfair to delay the
eviction for the 2 months the Tenant has requested. This is a long-term tenancy
in which this large family is experiencing financial hardship due to a loss of
income as well as an unsuccessful rent-to-own agreement. I am satisfied that
they will require additional time to find a new place to live and I find that
it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction for 60 days after the hearing
date which is June 13, 2018, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
It
is ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before June 13, 2018.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,391.61*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to April 16, 2018.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $63.12 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting April 17, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before April
27, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from April 28, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before June 13, 2018, then starting June 14,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 14, 2018.
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $5,935.00 if the payment is made on or before April 20, 2018, or
ii)       $9,775.00 if the payment is made on or before June 13, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after June 14, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
