Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-08396-18



 


 


 



 
C2LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict CB (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges
and related administration charges.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on October 16,
2018.
 
The Landlord’s
representative, FQ, the Tenant and the Tenant’s representative, JD attended the
hearing.
 Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from July 1, 2018 to
October 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective August 31, 2018.
2.     
The monthly rent as of the
date of the hearing is $1,080.00.
3.     
The Landlord incurred
charges of $20.00 for cheques tendered by or on behalf of the Tenant, which
were returned NSF and $80.00 for related administration charges.
4.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,080.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from March 1, 2018 to August 31, 2018.
6.     
There was no dispute that
the Tenant owes the Landlord $4,610.00, which represents the arrears of rent to
October 31, 2018, charges related to NSF cheques, and the application filing
fee. 
7.     
The Tenant moved into the
unit on or about March 1, 2018. The Tenant had knee surgery in February and was
employed doing building maintenance until March 2018. The Tenant began
receiving monthly benefits of $1,350.00 from the Ontario Disability Support
Program (ODSP) in September 2018. The Tenant says that he also intends to work
part-time and is looking for part-time employment. 
8.     
The Tenant requested relief
and indicated that he would be applying to the Housing Stabilization Fund (HSF)
and expects to receive the amount of $1,600.00. As such, the arrears would be
reduced to $3,010.00 and the Tenant proposed to pay the arrears by installments
of $167.22, along with the monthly rent, commencing November 1, 2018 until the
arrears are paid in full. It would take the Tenant 18 months to pay the
arrears. 
9.     
The Landlord opposed any
relief and the payment plan. The Landlord submitted that the Tenant has paid no
rent in over four months and the Tenant cannot afford this tenancy. The tenancy
is only seven months old and this is the second time the parties are before the
Board on arrears of rent. After moving into the unit, the Tenant fell into
arrears of rent and voided that order. The Tenant is now again in arrears. The
Landlord also says that the length of the payment plan is too long and unfair
that the Landlord has to wait for 18 months for the arrears to be paid. 
10.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. I say this
because the Tenant is in substantial arrears and has not paid any amount towards
the rent in over four months. I considered the Tenant’s payment plan and I am
not of the view that the length of the plan is reasonable. This is a short
tenancy and the Landlord should not have to wait for over a year and a half for
the arrears to be paid. Based on the Tenant’s current financial situation, I am
not persuaded that the Tenant has the means to sustain this tenancy.
11.  
The Tenant asked for a two
month delay in terminating the tenancy. It would be unfair to delay eviction considering
that the Tenant has not made any payment whatsoever, not even a token amount
towards the rent, despite being in receipt of funds from ODSP in September and
October.  Any delay in terminating the tenancy means that the Tenant would fall
further into arrears and the arrears would be $6,770.00.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before October
30, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $2,910.18*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to October 19, 2018 and the total charges related to NSF cheques tendered to
the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant, less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $35.51 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
October 20, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before October 30, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
October 31, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before October 30, 2018, then starting October 31, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after October 31, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before October 30,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $4,610.00** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after October 31, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
