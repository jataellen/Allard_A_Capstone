Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-12392-19
 











 
 
 

L M and G G (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict M U (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential
complex has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The
Landlords has also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the
Landlords for the damage; and because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or a person the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has seriously
impaired the safety of any person; and because the Tenant has been persistently
late in paying the Tenant's rent. The Landlords also claimed compensation for
each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on February 27,
2020.
 
Only the Landlords attended the
hearing. The Tenant was not present or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
For the reasons that follow, the application is granted and the tenancy between the
Landlords and the Tenant is terminated effective March 20, 2020.
L9 Application to Collect Rent the Tenant Owes
2.     
The Tenant has resided in
the rental unit since November 2018 and pays a monthly rent in the amount of
$1,640.00.
3.     
The Landlords gave
uncontested evidence that the Tenant did not pay the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period from October 11, 2019 to February 28, 2020.
Because of the arrears, the Landlord filed an L9 Application with the Board on
November 25, 2019 to collect the rent the Tenant owes.
4.     
The Tenant was in possession
of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
5.     
Based on the uncontested
evidence before the Board, I find that the Tenant did not pay the total rent
the Tenant was required to pay for the period from October 11, 2019 to March
10, 2020.
L2 Application to End a Tenancy and Evict a Tenant
6.     
The Landlords served the
Tenant with three Notices of Termination on November 11, 2019: an N8 Notice to
end the Tenancy at End of Term (‘N8 notice’), an N5 Notice to End the Tenancy
for Interfering with Others (‘N5 notice’) and an N7 Notice to End the Tenancy
for Causing Serious Problems in the Rental Unit (‘N7 notice’).
          N8 Notice of Termination
7.     
I find that the N8 notice is in compliance with
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, S.O. 2006, c.17 (Act), it meets the
60-day requirement and provides sufficient details as to the reason for the
notice.
8.     
On the Landlords’ unopposed evidence, I find
that the Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due,
as specified on the N8 notice. In addition, since this application was filed
the Board the Tenant has failed to pay any rent; no rent payment has been made by
the Tenant since October of 2019.
          N7 Notice of Termination
9.     
I find that the N7 notice of
termination that the Landlords’ L2 application is based on is invalid. The N7
notice does not set out the details as required by subsection 43(2) of the Act,
which requires a notice of termination to set out the reasons and details
respecting the termination. The N7 notice only states the following “Urgent
Inspection Called” it provides no details or reasons as to the alleged
impairment of safety.
10.  
The Divisional Court, in Ball
v Metro Capital Properties, [2002] O.J. No. 5931 (Div.Ct.) has held that
sufficient detail must include the dates and times of the alleged conduct to
fully inform the tenant of the issues that will be raised at the hearing so they
are able to adequately prepare and respond to those issues. Divisional Court
decisions are binding on members of the Board and must be followed. 
11.  
As the N7 notice fails to
comply with the Act and lacks sufficient details to meet the requirements of the
Ball case, this portion of the Landlords’ application must be dismissed
          N5 Notice of Termination
12.  
The Landlords served the
Tenant with the N5 notice indicating that the grounds for the notice were the
Tenant or someone visiting or living with the Tenant has wilfully or
negligently damaged the rental unit or the residential complex; the Landlords
claimed damages in the amount of $11,530.00. 
13.  
On an N5 notice, a tenant is
provided the opportunity to void the notice by paying the cost to replace or
repair the damaged property within seven days of being served with the notice.
In this case, the voiding period was from November 9, 2019 to November 16, 2019
inclusive.
14.  
At the hearing the Landlords
testified that the damages were not paid by November 16, 2019. Based on the
Landlords’ uncontested evidence, I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities,
that the Tenant did not void the N5 notice.
15.  
The Landlords claimed the
following damage to the rental unit:
•        
Damage to the Washer/Dryer
tower unit (10 years old): $2,896.00 replacement value, due to mouldy smell of
washer and mould on rubber seal;
•        
Damage to the stove (10
years old) - replacement value of stove $1,915.00;
•        
Damage to Fridge (2 years
old) - replacement value $846.00;
•        
Laminate floor removal and replacement
costs due to flooding in the unit December 27, 2018, August 1, 2019, September 3,
2019, November 4, 2019 - (flooring 2 years old); damage to the bathroom - towel
bar and drywall damage; vanity damage under the sink; two broken light switches;
unit to be painted due to smell of smoke (unit not painted in 10 years). The
total amount the Landlords claim for all of these items combined was $5,763.00;
and
•        
Flooding damage to other
units and common areas in the residential complex charged back to the Landlord
by the building management in the amount of $2,643.86.
16.  
The Landlords gave
uncontested evidence that the items above were damaged in the unit and the
amounts they claimed were as above.
17.  
Section 89 of the Act states
the following: 
A landlord may apply to the Board for an order requiring a
tenant to pay reasonable costs that the landlord has incurred or will incur for
the repair of or, where repairing is not reasonable, the replacement of damaged
property, if the tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person whom
the tenant permits in the residential complex wilfully or negligently causes
undue damage to the rental unit or the residential complex and the tenant is in
possession of the rental unit. 
18.  
The Landlords gave uncontested
evidence that they were advised by the building management that they were
called to the rental unit on the following dates because water was flowing from
the rental unit into either the common areas of the building or other rental
units due to water flowing from the unit’s bathtub or sink faucet; December 27,
2018, August 1, 2019, September 3, 2019, and November 4, 2019. The building has
charged back the Landlords for the repair work that they have had to complete
in other units and common areas of the residential complex in the amount of $2,643.86.
(Exhibit 9)
19.  
On the uncontested evidence
before the Board, I find that the work completed by the building management for
drywall repair and flooring, was wilfully or negligently caused by the Tenant
due to leaving the water flowing in her unit unattended. I find that the Landlords
are entitled to the amount of $2,643.86 for this damage. (Exhibit 6)
20.  
On the uncontested evidence
of the Landlords, I also find the following:
a.   
There was damage to the washer/dryer
unit wilfully or negligently caused by the Tenant. Based on the Landlords’
evidence, the washer/dryer unit was 10 years old. Based on Ontario Regulation
516/06 of the Act, I find the life of the unit to be 15 years. Therefore, based
on a depreciated value the Landlords will be entitled to the amount of $965.33
for the washer/dryer unit. (Exhibit 8)
b.    There was damage to the stove wilfully or
negligently caused by the Tenant. Based on the Landlords’ evidence, the stove
was 10 years old. Based on Ontario Regulation 516/06 of the Act, I find the
life of the unit to be 15 years. Therefore, based on a depreciated value the
Landlords will be entitled to the amount of $638.33 for the stove. (Exhibit 8)
c.    There was damage to the refrigerator wilfully or
negligently caused by the Tenant. Based on the Landlords’ evidence, the refrigerator
was 2 years old and based on Ontario Regulation 516/06 of the Act, I find the
life of the unit to be 8 years. Therefore, based on a depreciated value the
Landlords will be entitled to the amount of $834.50 for the refrigerator. (Exhibit
8)
          Lump Sum Damages
21.  
The Landlords also claimed
the total amount of $5,763.00 for damage to the laminate flooring, bathroom
cabinet, light switches, broken towel bar and drywall damage, and painting the
entire rental unit. (Exhibit 9)
22.  
On the uncontested evidence
of the Landlord I find that the water damage caused to the laminate flooring
was negligently or wilfully caused by the Tenant leaving the water running and
damaging the flooring. I also find that the damage to the light switches,
bathroom cabinet and the broken towel bar and resulting drywall were due to the
Tenant’s wilful or negligent damage to the rental unit. 
23.  
I find that the Landlord did
not provide sufficient evidence to prove on a balance of probabilities that the
rental unit requires re-painting due to the wilful or negligent behaviour of
the Tenant. I find that it is more likely that as the rental unit had not been
painted in 10 years, painting is likely necessary due to wear and tear and not
negligence. As the Landlord did not provide a breakdown for the cost of
painting the unit, I will deduct the amount of $1,000.00 for painting the
rental unit as a reasonable estimated cost.
24.  
I find that the Landlords
will be entitled to $4,763.00 for the wilful and negligent damage to the
flooring, cabinet, light switches, and towel bar and drywall. 
25.  
The Landlords incurred costs
of $190.00 for filing the application and is entitled to reimbursement of those
costs.
26.  
The Landlords collected a
rent deposit of $1,550.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlords.
27.  
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from December 11, 2015 to January 10,
2020
28.  
The Tenant did not attend the hearing to provide
evidence regarding their circumstances and the Landlords testified that they
were unaware of any circumstances that would require the Board to delay or deny
an eviction. I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlords and the Tenant is terminated, as of March 20,
2020. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before March 20, 2020.
2.      The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $6,792.68,
which represents the amount of rent owing from October 11, 2019 to March 10,
2020 less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlords $9,645.02, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing and
replacing the damaged property.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
The total amount that the
Tenant owes to the Landlord for rent arrears, damaged property and the
application fee is $16,627.20.
6.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $53.92 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from
March 10, 2020 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
7.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlords the full amount owing on or before March 20, 2020, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 21,
2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
8.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 20, 2020, then starting March 21, 2020, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlords on or after March 21, 2020.
