Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-98445-18
 










 
 

#.O.L
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict A.G
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes
(“the L1 application”).
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the rent (“the
L2 application”).
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on October 24, 2018.
 
The
Landlord’s legal representative, N.M (“NM”), attended the hearing.  The Tenant
(who prior to the hearing had spoken with duty counsel) attended the hearing
and was self-represented.
 
Request
for Adjournment
 
1.   
The
Tenant requested an adjournment of the applications.    She described that in
addition to raising issues under s.82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(“the Act”), she needs more time to complete the detailed written submissions
she has begun to prepare for the hearing in respect to the “safety problems”
posed for her in the unit/complex from the “large criminal organization”
operated by the Landlord.  She indicated that the Landlord is trying to control
her, and among other things, has stolen her inheritance from her father and
tried to kill her by means of a named fellow tenant (who is a sometime employee
of the Landlord). 
 
2.    The
Landlord opposed the adjournment request.
 
3.   
As
I outlined at the hearing, I see no reasonable grounds to adjourn these
applications.  After hearing the submissions of the Tenant, and completing a
summary review of her many and voluminous pre-hearing submissions (seemingly
the brief to which the Tenant referred in her adjournment request), I do not
believe it is reasonable to delay the hearing of these applications based upon
the information and submissions provided.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
residential unit is a room in shared accommodation. 
 
2.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from August 1, 2018 to October 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October 31, 2018.
 
3.      The
Tenant paid $1,218.00 after the application was filed.
 
4.      NM
provided a written summary of the Landlord’s financial claims at the hearing.
 
5.      As
outlined by NM at the hearing, the balance of arrears is reasonably small.  
While the Tenant expressed her concern re: the rent increase which came into
effect on September 1, 2018, NM explained that the Tenant’s payment pattern is
not simply explained by a protest against the rent increase.  NM noted that the
balance owing by the Tenant as of the hearing date –as a matter of mathematics
- does not simply amount to the equivalent of the increased rent the Tenant has
been charged for the unit since September.
 
6.      The
Tenant did not challenge the Landlord’s claim for arrears of rent but requested
that these amounts be paid “without prejudice”.   This request was denied at
the hearing. 
 
7.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $535.06 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
8.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2007
to October 31, 2018.
 
9.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
10.   The Tenant has persistently paid her rent late.  The Tenant did
not contest this allegation, but noted that she is forced to pay her rent –
which she does regularly in cash – at variable times such that the Landlord
does not become familiar with her travel patterns so that it is in a position to
harm her.
 
11.   With respect to the L2 application, as outlined by NM, the
Landlord is not seeking termination of the tenancy but asking for a
conditional, “pay on time order”.
 
12.   As stated at the hearing, I believe that a conditional “pay on
time” order with respect to the L2 application is appropriate under the
circumstances. 
 
13.   However, my concern with such an order is that the Tenant may be a
person with a disability as defined in the Human Rights Code (“the
Code”). The Tenant seems – with no reasonable basis – to be entirely convinced that
the Landlord and its agents are committed to, and have devoted considerable resources
and planning toward - doing her physical and financial harm.  It is my
obligation under the Code to accommodate the Tenant short of undue hardship. 
However, the Tenant neither has requested accommodation nor self-identified as
a person with a disability.
 
14.   In this context, what I believe is appropriate in light of my
comments above, is to defer the start date of the conditional order with
respect to the L2 application.  Instead of a start date of November 1, 2018,
the pay-on-time requirement will begin on December 1, 2018.
 
15.   This delayed beginning of the requirement to pay on time shall
allow the Tenant a) to get legal and other advice on the order and the
requirement to pay on time; and b) to make necessary arrangements to pay her
rent on time in a manner with which the Tenant feels comfortable.
It is ordered that:
 
L1 application
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before November 5, 2018.
 
2.      As
of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation
the Landlord is entitled to by $1,552.21*.
 
3.      However,
the Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the
Landlord owes the Tenant:


-$17.91
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting October 26, 2018 to
the date the Tenant moves out of the unit, and
-$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.      The
Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as
a result of this order.
 
5.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before November 5, 2018, then starting November
6, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after November 6,
2018.
 
7.      If
the Tenant wishes to void the L1 portion of this order and continue the tenancy
(subject to the L2 portion of this order below), the Tenant must pay to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust:
 
i)        $204.38
if the payment is made on or before October 31, 2018, or
ii)       $749.07 if the payment is made on or before November 5, 2018**.


If the
Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if the Tenant pays the amount required under that subsection
on or after November 6, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to
the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
L2 application
 
9.     
If the Tenant voids the L1 portion of this order by paying the
required amount to the Landlord set out in paragraph 7 above, the tenancy shall
continue subject to the requirements in paragraphs 10 and 11 below.
 
10.   For
the 12-month period beginning in December 2018 and continuing for each month
until November 2019 inclusive, the Tenant shall pay the monthly rent to the
Landlord on or before the first day of each month. 
 
11.   If
the Tenant fails to make any of the payments required under paragraph 10 of
this order in full and on time, the Landlord may apply under s.78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 within 30 days of the breach and without notice to the
Tenant for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant.
