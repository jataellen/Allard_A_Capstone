Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-04649-19
 











 
 
 

S.M. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict M.S.A. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did
not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on October 9,
2019.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant
attended the hearing. The Landlord was represented by D.G..
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The dispute between the
parties here is with respect to the amount of rent the Tenant has paid.
2.     
The Tenant says he moved
into the rental unit on March 2, 2019 and paid $1,000.00 to the Landlord at
that time in cash. That amount represents rent for the month of March, 2019 and
a last month’s rent deposit of $500.00. 
3.     
After that the Tenant says
he paid an additional month’s rent of $500.00 but he stopped paying the rent
because of conflict with the Landlord. That conflict included an incident where
the Landlord went into his room and stole $950.00. The Tenant also says he did
some work for the Landlord in exchange for rent. 
4.     
The allegations about the
Landlord entering the Tenant’s room and taking money are contained in an
application filed with the Board by the Tenant (in Board file TET-01543-19).
That application was filed on May 27, 2019 and has not been finally resolved.
5.     
The Landlord says the Tenant
did not move in until March 7 or 8, 2019. He is an international student and he
called the Landlord looking for a place to stay. He told the Landlord he could
not afford a last month’s rent deposit. The Landlord says he picked up the
Tenant from a motel and drove the Tenant to the Dollarama to buy sundries.
After that they went to an ATM machine and the Tenant gave the Landlord $500.00
for rent for the month of March, 2019. 
6.     
The Tenant says that is not
possible as he did not have a bank account on March 2, 2019. He had American
dollars he brought with him from home and converted it to Canadian which he
paid to the Landlord. 
7.     
According to the Landlord,
nothing further was ever paid. The Landlord also says he never hired the Tenant
to do work although the Tenant volunteered to so some chores. 
8.     
With respect to the theft
allegation, the Landlord argues it is irrelevant as the Tenant has no evidence
but hearsay in the form of the police report. The Tenant was not present at the
time in question and his belief the Landlord stole money from him is based on
unsubstantiated hearsay.
9.     
Finally, the Tenant argues
that he should be believed over the Landlord because if he stopped paying money
to the Landlord as soon as he moved in then why did the Landlord do nothing
until after the Tenant filed his application, and after that application came
before the Board and an interim order for disclosure was issued. The Landlord
responds to that argument by stating the delay occurred because his original
paralegal failed to do the work he was hired to do and the Landlord had to fire
him and find another one. 
10.  
This final argument between
the parties is not helpful in that it is essentially a draw as the Board’s
records corroborate both parties’ statements. The notice of termination on
which this application is based was issued and served after the initial appearance
before the Board on the Tenant’s application. The Landlord had a different
representative at that time. And the Landlord complied with the Board’s order
to produce medical documentation proving he was unable to attend the original
date for the Tenant’s application. 
11.  
The evidence with respect to
the alleged theft is also not helpful because it is based on uncorroborated
hearsay. 
12.  
So what was paid and not
paid?
13.  
Although the Landlord bears
the burden of proof because this is the Landlord’s application, a party cannot
prove a negative. The Landlord cannot produce documents showing he did not
receive money from the Tenant. So the Tenant has the onus of leading sufficient
evidence to establish it is more likely than not that payment was made as he
alleges. 
14.  
There is no dispute between
the parties that the Landlord did not provide the Tenant with a receipt for any
payment, but the Tenant should be in a position to produce some documentation
to support his version of events. For example, the receipt corroborating the
conversion of American dollars into Canadian, bank records showing when his
bank account was opened, bank records showing deposits and withdrawals for the
additional month’s rent of $500.00 he says he paid after first and last; these
are all documents that should be readily available to the Tenant. During the
course of the hearing the Tenant referred to text messages that would prove he
moved in on March 2, 2019 and not March 7 or 8th as the Landlord
claims but no such text messages were produced. 
15.  
As for the delay in pursuing
the Tenant for the unpaid rent I agree with the Tenant that might give rise to
some suspicion about the Landlord’s veracity, but the Landlord offers a
reasonable explanation for that delay that is corroborated in part by the Board’s
records. 
16.  
In other words, the evidence
is insufficient to establish the Tenant made the payments to the Landlord that
he claims to have made. As a result, I find that the Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from March 1, 2019 to
October 31, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 2, 2019.
17.  
The arrears of rent owing
for the period ending October 31, 2019 total $3,000.00 as claimed by the
Landlord. 
18.  
The Landlord incurred costs
of $175.00 for filing the application and is entitled to reimbursement of those
costs.
19.  
The final issue is with
respect to relief from eviction. The Tenant did not ask for relief and the only
evidence offered by him as to his circumstances is that he is an international
student who receives $1,000.00 a month from his parents at home. Given the
amount of time that has passed since the hearing before the Board and the lack
of any evidence or submissions from the Tenant in support of relief, I find
that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.
20.  
This order contains all of
the reasons for the decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.
It is ordered that:
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before January
21, 2020.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $4,637.20* (less any payment made to the Landlord by the Tenant after
the hearing before the Board), which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 10, 2020.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $16.44 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
January 11, 2020 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 21, 2020, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
January 22, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 21, 2020, then starting January 22, 2020, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 22, 2020.
8.     
If, on or before January 21,
2020, the Tenant pays the amount of $5,175.00**(less any payment made to the
Landlord by the Tenant after the hearing before the Board) to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that
the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit. 
If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this
order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after January 22, 2020 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
