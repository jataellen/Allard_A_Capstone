Review Order
 
B.L. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict S.J. (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was resolved by order TEL-85465-17 issued on December 15, 2017.
 
On
December 18, 2017, the Tenant requested a review of the order.
 
The
request was heard in Belleville on January 5, 2018.
 
The
Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
THE
REVIEW REQUEST
1.      The
Tenant says that he did not attend the original hearing of this application on
December 12, 2017 because his truck slid off the road. By the time he got his
truck back on the road it was mid-afternoon and too late to attend the hearing
site. According to the Tenant he was unable to call the Board or the Landlord when
he went off the road because he did not have a functioning cell phone. 
2.      The
Tenant says that he definitely intended to attend and had evidence with him for
the hearing. He made calls the next day and discovered what to do. This review
was filed within a week of the original hearing. 
3.      The
Landlord says the Tenant told him his truck would not start which the Tenant
denies saying. Otherwise, the Landlord has no knowledge of what happened to the
Tenant on the day of the original hearing or why he did not attend.
4.      Whether
or not the Tenant’s truck would not start or he went off the road does not
really matter in this instance. I have no reason to doubt the Tenant when he
says he intended to participate and was unable to get here. As a result the
Tenant’s review request is granted.
THE
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
5.      There
is no dispute between the parties that the Tenant has not paid the total rent
the Tenant was required to pay for the period from October 1, 2017 to January
31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective October 17, 2017.
6.      There
is also no dispute that the arrears of rent owing for the period ending January
31, 2018 total $3,000.00. 
7.      The
Landlord incurred costs of $190.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
8.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $750.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
9.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 7, 2017 to October
17, 2017 totalling $5.05.
THE
TENANT’S SECTION 82 CLAIMS
10.   The
Tenant asserts a claim by way of section 82 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). He applies for an order determining that the
Landlord failed to meet the Landlord's maintenance obligations under the Act or
failed to comply with health, safety, housing or maintenance standards.
11.   The
Tenant’s claims involve: upkeep of the grounds; the bathroom; flooring; smoke
damage; drywall repairs; and the living room ceiling. 
The
Grounds
12.   The
Tenant’s primary complaint appears to be upkeep of the grounds.
13.   The
rental unit has an extensive yard around it. There is a public school close by.
Teenagers from the school loiter on the public sidewalk adjacent to the
Tenant’s yard and routinely throw cigarette butts onto the yard. They also tend
to harass his dog. His attempts to ask the teenagers to stop have been
stressful and unsuccessful. He says he is in receipt of Ontario Disability
Support Program benefits for anxiety. 
14.   The
Tenant says he is responsible under the tenancy agreement for yard maintenance
so he has cleaned it up a number of times. 
15.   The
Tenant has spoken to the Landlord about this issue, called the police and the
school, and once went into the town office about it. He discussed with the
Landlord the possibility of a fence being put up and suggested he might do that
himself. 
16.   The
Landlord says the Tenant never asked the Landlord to install a fence although
they did discuss the possibility when the Tenant first moved in in May of 2017.
It was idle chitchat according to the Landlord. 
17.   He
has also spoken to the school and the police about the teenagers loitering and
smoking. The principal essentially said not all of the pupils behave that way
and the police told him they are entitled to loiter on the public sidewalk. 
18.   More
importantly, the Landlord says the area the Tenant complains about being
littered with cigarette butts is actually not part of his property. There is a
strip of land between the edge of his property and the public sidewalk which
belongs to the municipality. That is where the teenagers are littering. The
Tenant does not dispute this statement by the Landlord so I accept it is true. 
19.   Subsection
20(1) of the Act says:
A landlord is responsible
for providing and maintaining a residential complex, including the rental units
in it, in a good state of repair and fit for habitation and for complying with
health, safety, housing and maintenance standards.  
20.   Despite
the agreement between the parties with respect to yard maintenance this
provision means it is the Landlord who is responsible for maintenance and
repair. A landlord is entitled to enter into a separate agreement with a tenant
whereby the tenant does maintenance work in exchange for some consideration,
but responsibility for maintenance remains with the landlord. (See: Montgomery
v. Van, 2009 ONCA 808.)
21.   But
the problem that arises here is that the area the Tenant wants maintained is
not part of the residential complex. It is town land. So section 20 does not
require the Landlord to maintain it. 
22.   The
Tenant is clearly upset by the behaviour of the teenagers and believes the
Landlord should do something to stop them from harassing the Tenant and his
dog. 
23.   Section
22 of the Act says:
A landlord shall not at
any time during a tenant’s occupancy of a rental unit and before the day on
which an order evicting the tenant is executed substantially interfere with the
reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or the residential complex in which it
is located for all usual purposes by a tenant or members of his or her
household.
24.   This
provision has been interpreted to mean that a landlord has a positive
obligation to take reasonable steps to address a tenant’s complaints about the
behaviour of third parties. 
25.   The
Landlord has spoken with the school and talked to the police. A fence would
only enclose his own property and do nothing to stop the behaviour the Tenant
complains of. 
26.   Absent
some other proposal by the Tenant as to what the Landlord could reasonably do
to ameliorate the situation, I am not prepared to make a finding the Landlord
failed to take reasonable steps in response to the Tenant’s issue. 
27.   As
a result of all of the above the Tenant’s claim with respect to the grounds
upkeep must be dismissed. 
The
Bathroom
28.   The
bathroom is in a significant state of disrepair. Pictures entered into evidence
by the Tenant show a hole in the tile surrounding the tub, crumbling and disintegrating
tile along the tub, cracked and missing floor tiles, discoloured walls, and
ceiling water damage or mould. The Tenant also says the tub has not drained
properly for a month or so, the painted tub is peeling, and there is rough
plaster work that needs sanding and painting.
29.   The
Landlord has not been in the unit for more than two years so I accept the
Tenant’s evidence with respect to the state of the bathroom in its entirety. 
30.   An
order shall issue requiring the Landlord to repair the bathroom.
31.   The
real dispute between the parties is with respect to the Landlord’s knowledge of
the disrepair. The reason this is an issue is because a landlord will not be
held financially liable for disrepair that the landlord does not know about.
(See: ss. 16 and 30(2); and the Board’s Interpretation Guideline 5 Breach of
Maintenance Obligations.)
32.   The
Tenant says he complained to the Landlord about the state of the bathroom in
the summer of 2017, probably in July. According to the Tenant, the Landlord
said he would come by and look at in a couple of months to do something but
nothing was done. He also says he raised it again just before the first hearing
which was held on December 12, 2017.
33.   The
Tenant also says that he stopped paying the rent in October of 2017 and when
the Landlord contacted him about it he told the Landlord he was withholding the
rent until the Landlord did repairs. 
34.   The
Landlord says that in September of 2017 the Tenant called out of the blue and
in an off-hand kind of way stated that if the Tenant was going to stay they
needed to talk about upgrades. Then on November 2, 2017 he called the Tenant
frustrated over his non-payment of rent and the Tenant specifically complained
then about the bathroom. He says he did not go inspect because the Tenant never
wanted the Landlord or his wife to come around and would not answer the door.
He has never served a notice of entry in the 35 years he has been a landlord. 
35.   On
any application to the Board the applicant bears the burden of proof. That
means the Tenant has the onus of proving his version of events about when he
complained to the Landlord is more likely to be true than not. Given this onus
and because of the conflict in the evidence of the parties I am not prepared to
make a finding that the Tenant complained to the Landlord about the state of
the bathroom until November 2, 2017. 
36.   At
that point in time the Landlord had a positive obligation to inspect the rental
unit and initiate repairs. His failure to do that entitles the Tenant to a
monetary remedy. 
37.   In
landlord and tenant matters the normal monetary remedy is abatement of the
rent. Abatement is a contractual remedy. It represents the idea that rent is
paid in exchange for goods and services and where those goods and services are
not being provided the rent should be abated proportional to the difference
between what is being paid for and what is being received. 
38.   Neither
party offered a submission as to the appropriate quantum of abatement.  
39.   Given
the substantial state of disrepair shown in the photographs, the number of
rooms in the rental unit, the Tenant’s evidence of the impact the disrepair has
had on him, and my experience of like cases it seems to me that a reasonable
abatement of the rent would be about 15% of the rent charged for the period three
month period starting November 2, 2017 or $337.50. 
The
Floors, Walls and Living Room Ceiling
40.   The
Tenant’s pictures show that the tile flooring is damaged and cracked
particularly where the tile meets the living room carpet. The walls are
nicotine stained. A ceiling tile is damaged and plaster repairs to walls and
ceilings are needed in several areas. 
41.   Again,
and for the reasons stated above, I accept the Tenant’s evidence with respect
to the disrepair in its entirety.
42.   An
order shall issue requiring the Landlord to repair the rental unit. 
43.   The
problem that arises is that the Landlord says the Tenant never complained to
him about these items. He knew nothing about them until the day of the hearing.
As a result, I am not convinced on the balance of probabilities that the
Landlord knew or ought to have known of these issues. 
44.   That
being said, if the Landlord had inspected the bathroom after November 2, 2017
he would have seen the other disrepair. So I believe the Tenant is entitled to
some further abatement with respect to these other items.
45.   In
terms of quantum, except for the flooring the disrepair is mostly cosmetic. So
given the photographs and my knowledge of previous like cases I believe a
reasonable quantum of abatement would be about 10% for the same three month
period or $225.00. 
46.   The
total abatement awarded to the Tenant under this order is $562.50. This amount
shall be offset against the rent arrears owing. 
RELIEF
FROM EVICTION
47.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Act. 
48.   The
Tenant says he wants to stay and asks for a repayment plan of $100.00 per
month. The Landlord opposes this request on the basis that the Tenant is
unlikely to comply with it and cannot afford the rental unit.
49.   The
Tenant has lived in the unit since May of 2017. He essentially took it over
from friends who were renting from the Landlord; the Landlord did not actually
rent the unit to the Tenant but let him stay because he knows the Tenant’s
family and felt sorry for him. 
50.   As
stated above, the Tenant is in receipt of ODSP. He makes about $1,080.00 a
month. The monthly rent is $750.00. His other expenses include hydro ($50.00),
a pay and go phone ($15.00), and car insurance ($150.00). He cannot say how
much he spends on food but relies on the food bank. He lives alone in the
rental unit but his child visits on weekends. 
51.   The
Landlord says the Tenant has never paid rent on time. He says the Tenant told
the Landlord’s wife that he just had other bills to pay. The Tenant
corroborated that statement in part by saying that although he withheld the
rent because of disrepair he no longer has that money to give the Landlord. He
used it for truck repairs. 
52.   The
Landlord also says that the Tenant’s non-payment means he has to juggle things
to pay his bills. His wife manages the books and the Tenant’s behaviour has
caused friction between them. The Landlord’s wife is 70 years old, she has been
ill and she has suggested more than once that maybe they should just sell their
rental units. She does not want to discuss it; the Landlord gets upset; and the
situation is frustrating. 
53.   Given
all of the circumstances here I agree with the Landlord that it appears the
Tenant cannot afford the rental unit. At the time of the hearing of the review
request the Tenant was four months in arrears of rent and had no money in the
bank to pay towards the rent arrears. His income and expense profile and the
undisputed evidence of the Landlord with respect to his chronic late payment
indicate it is highly unlikely that the Tenant could or would comply with his
proposed repayment plan. 
54.   I
would observe at this point that although the rental unit is in disrepair and
the Landlord should have inspected the unit back in November of 2017, I am not
prepared to make a finding that the Landlord is in “serious” breach of the
Landlord’s obligations within the meaning of s. 83(3)(a). The Landlord is in
breach of the Act but it is not so serious as to trigger mandatory relief from
eviction. 
55.   That
being said, the Tenant suffers from an anxiety disorder, has fallen on hard
times and the Landlord is in fact in breach of the Act. The Tenant is not
eligible for housing stabilisation fund and it will be very difficult for him
to locate new housing. 
56.   Given
all of the above, I find that it would be unfair to impose on the Landlord the
repayment plan the Tenant proposes but it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until February 28, 2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. An
order shall issue accordingly. 
57.   This
order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further
reasons shall be issued.
It
is ordered that:
 
1.     Order
TEL-85465-17 issued on December 15, 2017 is cancelled and replaced by the
following: 
2.     Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before February 28, 2018.
3.     The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,863.55*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to February 6, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit and less the amount of the
abatement the Landlord owes the Tenant.
4.     The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $24.66 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 7, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
5.     The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
6.     If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2018, then starting March 1,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2018.
8.     If,
on or before February 28, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $3,377.50** to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. 
This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain
in the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.     The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if he pays the amount required under that subsection on or
after March 1, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
10.  The
Landlord shall:
(1)  Repair
the bathroom so that: the walls and ceiling are smooth and of a uniform colour;
the floor tile is unbroken and of a uniform pattern and texture; the tub has a
smooth finish and drains properly; and the tile surrounding the tub is smooth
and unbroken and of a uniform pattern and texture.
(2)  Repair
the flooring throughout the rental unit so that there are no tripping hazards
or cracked or broken tiles.
(3)  Repair
the plaster walls, ceilings and ceiling tiles so that they are smooth, unbroken
and of a uniform texture and colour.
11.  If the
Landlord does not comply with paragraph 10(1) above on or before February 28,
2018 then the Tenant is authorised to deduct 15% of the rent charged from the
rent due starting March 1, 2018 until the repairs are completed.
12.  If the
Landlord does not comply with paragraph 10(2) above on or before February 28,
2018 then the Tenant is authorised to deduct 5% of the rent charged from the
rent due starting March 1, 2018 until the repairs are completed.
13.  If the
Landlord does not comply with paragraph 10(3) above on or before February 28,
2018 then the Tenant is authorised to deduct 5% of the rent charged from the
rent due starting March 1, 2018 until the repairs are completed.
