Landlords’ L1 application.
C.T. and M.J. (the
'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict K.L. (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
Landlords’ L2 application.
C.T. and M.J. (the
'Landlords') also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict K.L.
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or
someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlords or another tenant. The Landlords also claimed compensation for
each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
These applications were heard
in Whitby on May 14, 2018.
 
Only the Landlords attended the
hearing. H.P. attended as a witness for the Landlord.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
With respect to the
Landlords’ L1 application, the
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from December 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective April 29, 2018.
2.     
The Landlords collected a
rent deposit of $1,800.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlords.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from December 1, 2017 to April 29, 2018.
4.     
With respect to the
Landlords’ L2 application, the
Landlord served the Tenants with an N5 notice on April 5, 2018.
5.     
As nothing changed at the
unit and the problems persisted in the 7 days following the notice having been
given, this notice was not voided and is now an active notice.
6.     
The second notice issued on
April 13, 2018 is void as you can not issue a second notice when the first
notice was not voided.
7.     
As the first notice was
filed within 30 days of the termination date it is valid to proceed with
eviction procedures.
8.     
The witness who lives next
door testified that on a daily basis there is large amounts of noise coming
from the excessive amount of people that seem to come and go from the rental
unit at all hours of the day and night.
9.     
There is persistent fights,
yelling and screaming ongoing from all the occupants and their guests.
10.  
The Tenant also has a dog
that makes excessive noise and does its business on the lawn all of the time of
which no one cleans up.
11.  
There was also a stolen
vehicle that was parked on the property on March 9, 2018 which the Police have
since impounded and charged two members of the Tenant’s family with possession
of.
12.  
There also appears to be a
constant stream of drug oriented people coming and going to the unit which is
undesirable and against the other tenants reasonable enjoyment of their unit.
13.  
This conduct has
substantially interfered with the Landlords' and the other tenants' reasonable
enjoyment of the residential complex.
14.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The tenancy between the Landlords
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before May 28, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlords $8,168.08*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to May 17, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $59.18 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
May 18, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before May 28, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from May 29,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before May 28, 2018, then starting May 29, 2018, the Landlords may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlords, on or after May 29, 2018.
