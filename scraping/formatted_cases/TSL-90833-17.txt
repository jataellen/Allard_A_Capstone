Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-90833-17
 










 
 
 

#.G
(Toronto) Limited (the 'Landlord') applied, to the Landlord and Tenant Board
(the “Board”), for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict A.T and J.B (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on January 29, 2018 and February 22, 2018.
 
The
Landlord was represented by S.K, licensed paralegal. The Tenant, A.T (“AT”)
attended the hearing on January 29, 2018, she did not attend on February 22nd.
The Tenant J.B (“JB”) did not attend the hearing on either date set.
 
The
Tenants did not attend the hearing on February 22nd. I had no record
before me of a request to adjourn and I was satisfied the Tenants received
proper notice of the time, place and location of the hearing. Nonetheless, I
waited past 2:00 p.m. When the Tenants still did not arrive, I proceeded to
hear the Landlord’s application.
 
Determinations:
 
Preliminary Matters
 
Tenant JB
 
1.     
On
January 26, 2018, the Board received a lengthy email from Tenant JB explaining
why he was not planning to attend the hearing scheduled for January 29th.
In summary, JB writes about alleged abusive conduct, directed towards him, by
Tenant AT and her boyfriend, since approximately June, 2017. JB goes on to
explain he would not attend the January 29th hearing out of fear of
AT and her boyfriend. 
2.     
JB
also provided a Tenant’s Statement About Sexual or Domestic Violence and Abuse
(the “Form N15”), which JB states he served to the Landlord on or about October
31, 2017, giving the Landlord notice he would be vacating the unit on November
30, 2017. From the documents provided by JB, it appears he purportedly vacated
the unit on December 1, 2018. However, the Landlord’s legal representative
stated, as at February 22, 2017, JB remained in possession of one or more keys
to the unit and some of his belongings remained in the unit. On January 29th,
AT testified JB’s room in the unit is locked as JB placed a lock on the door to
his room and, further, some of JB’s belongings remain in his room. 
3.     
In
some circumstances Tenants are entitled to terminate a tenancy by serving a
notice to terminate in Form N15 on the Landlord—here JB was no so entitled.
Pursuant to s. 47.2(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') a joint tenant may terminate his or her interest in a tenancy by giving
notice of termination to the landlord if the tenant is deemed under subsection
47.3 (1) to have experienced violence or another form of abuse. As is clearly
stated on the Form N15, the tenant serving the Form N15, or his or her child,
must be at risk of harm or injury at the hands of a spouse or former spouse,
someone the tenant lives with, or lived with in a conjugal relationship, a
person the tenant dated or used to date or a person related by blood to the
tenant or the tenant’s child. The very lengthy email and other documents
submitted by JB to the Board on January 26th fail to disclose any
such required relationship between JB and AT or JB and AT’s boyfriend and, as
such, JB was not permitted to serve the Form N15 to the Landlord.  
4.     
Given
all of the above, I am satisfied that JB was in possession of the unit for the
purposes of the Act on the date the Landlord’s application was filed on
November 28, 2017 and, as such, JB will remain a named respondent Tenant in the
style of cause. 
5.     
I
should also state the documents provided by JB clearly indicate he was well
aware of the January 29th hearing date—indeed, JB included a copy of
the notice of hearing in his documentation submitted to the Board. The
documents provided do not, in my view, provide an adequate reason for JB’s
non-attendance. In the event JB’s fear of attending the hearing was genuine, it
was open to him to request accommodation in the form of additional security in
the hearing room. Such requests are regularly received by the Board and the
requesting party is much more often than not accommodated accordingly.
Costs
6.     
On
January 29, 2018, and approximately five hours after the conclusion of the
hearing, Tenant AT sent an email to the Board stating, in part, two payments
made by her in December, 2017 and January, 2018, each in the sum of $664.51,
were not reflected in the Landlord’s L1/L9 update form submitted during the
hearing; consequently the arrears amount claimed by the Landlord was in error.
7.     
AT’s
email appeared somewhat curious to me as the Landlord’s L1/L9
update form submitted during the hearing, and provided to her, clearly reflects
the two payments referred to in the email. However, not knowing if AT may have,
perhaps, been referring to additional payments made in the same amount, and as
an accommodation to her, as a self-represented Tenant, I decided to reconvene the
hearing as my order had not yet been written. The matter was scheduled to
reconvene on February 22nd and the Board sent out notices of hearing
to the parties at their respective addresses and nothing was returned as
undelivered. On February 22nd there was nothing in the file
indicating AT had not received the notice of hearing, was unable to attend or
required an adjournment. Yet, AT failed to attend, so I proceeded to hear the
Landlord’s evidence and submissions.
8.     
The
Landlord’s legal representative requested an order for costs against Tenant AT for
preparation and attendance. The Landlord’s representative stated AT’s email of
January 29th led to the Board reconvening the hearing and, on the
scheduled date, AT did not bother to attend. The Landlord’s representative
requested an order for costs in the sum of $450.00 and that I add that amount
to the quantum required to void my order, below.
9.     
The
Board’s Interpretation Guideline 3, entitled Costs, says, in part:
The Board should not
use its power to order costs in a way which would discourage landlords and
tenants from exercising their statutory rights.
Generally, costs may
be ordered where a party's conduct in the proceeding was unreasonable…
Before ordering a
party, a party's agent or a party's legal representative to pay costs, a Member
should ensure that the person who will be affected by the order for costs has
an opportunity to make submissions on the matter.
However, if a
party has received notice of a hearing and does not attend a hearing, or if a
party's agent or legal representative is on the record as representing a party
and does not attend a hearing, a Member may proceed to make an order for costs
without notifying the person affected of the intention to do so, provided that
the failure to attend the hearing delayed the process unnecessarily or caused
unnecessary expense to the other party…
A Member has
the discretion to require a party, a party's agent or a party's legal
representative to pay, as costs, any representation or preparation expenses of
another party where the conduct of the party, a party's agent or a party's
legal representative was unreasonable. Conduct is unreasonable if it causes
undue expense or delay… [Emphasis added] 
10.  
Unaware
AT would not attend on February 22nd, the Landlord’s representative
prepared for, and attended, the hearing. AT had ample time, prior to the day of
the hearing, to communicate her decision not to attend the hearing to the
Landlord, the Landlord’s legal representative and the Board. Yet, she did
nothing and simply did not show up. Given all of the circumstances an adverse
costs award is clearly warranted as against AT as her failure to notify anyone
of his decision not to attend the hearing was unreasonable and caused undue expense
to the Landlord. An order will issue accordingly. While the Landlord’s legal
representative requested I attach the costs award to the amount required to
void the order, I will not do so as, in my view, and notwithstanding this may
be permissible by the statute, to do so is too prejudicial to the remaining
Tenant, AT,—especially given the quantum of the costs award. Moreover, adding
the costs award to the amount required to void the order would unfairly bind
Tenant JB, who, in all likelihood, had nothing to do with AT’s non-attendance
on February 22nd.
The February 14th Cheque
11.  
Lastly,
prior to the February 22nd sitting of the hearing, Tenant AT
delivered a personal cheque, in the sum of $3,987.00 and dated February 14,
2018, to the Landlord. As at February 22nd sitting, the Landlord’s
representative was unable to state whether the cheque had cleared. In the event
the said cheque clears, the Tenants are permitted to deduct the amount of
$3,987.00 from the amount required to void this order as outline below.
The
Landlord’s Application
12.  
The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,993.51 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
13.  
Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from May 1, 2017 to
November 23, 2017.
14.  
The
Tenants paid $1,329.02 after the application was filed.
15.  
The
Landlord’s legal representative requested a standard order.
16.  
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act. In particular, on January 29, 2018, AT stated she
is willing and able to pay the total amount required to void the order within
the eleven days normally required by a standard order. Indeed, and as stated
above, AT provided the Landlord with a cheque dated February 14, 2018 in the
sum of $3,987.00. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless
the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before March 9, 2018.
2.     
The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $3,729.73*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to February 26, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     
The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $65.54 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 27, 2018 to the date they move out of the
unit.
4.     
The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.     
If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March
9, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from March 10, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If
the unit is not vacated on or before March 9, 2018, then starting March 10,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 10, 2018.
8.     
If
the Tenants wish to void this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $6,170.51 if the payment is made on or before February 28, 2018, or
ii)       $8,164.02 if the payment is made on or before March 9, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after March 10, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
10.  
Tenant
Annie Turcotte shall pay to the Landlord costs in the amount of $450.00 by
March 15, 2018. 
11.  
If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before March
15, 2018, she will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from March 16, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
