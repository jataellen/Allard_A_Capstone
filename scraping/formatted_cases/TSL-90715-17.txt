Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-90715-17
 










 
 

#.B.C.H.I
(the 'Landlord') applied, to the Landlord and Tenant Board (the “Board”), for
an order to terminate the tenancy and evict K.D (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on February 20, 2018.
 
The
Landlord was represented by D.C, licensed paralegal. 
 
The
Tenant did not attend the hearing and was represented by A.S(“AS”), a co-tenant
of the residential complex, agent.
 
J.H
(“JH”), the superintendent of the complex, appeared as a witness for the
Landlord.
 
Determinations:
 
Preliminary Matter(s)
 
1.      The arrears
claimed in the within application stem from the Tenant’s failure to pay statutory
rent increases in 2016 and 2017. The Tenant’s position is that the N4 notice is
invalid because it does not state the lawful rent. The Tenant alleges that he
was not served with a Notice of Rent Increase (“NORI”) raising the monthly rent
to $1,417.33, effective August 1, 2016 (the “2016 NORI”) and, further, he was
not served with a NORI raising the monthly rent to $1,438.58, effective August
1, 2017 (the “2017 NORI”).
2.      JH, the
superintendent of the complex, testified she served the 2016 NORI to the Tenant
on or about 6 p.m. on April 20, 2016, by placing the document under the door to
the unit. JH further testified she served the 2017 NORI to the Tenant on or
about 11 a.m. on April 30, 2017, by placing the document under the door to the
unit. The Landlord provided a Notice of Rent Increase (Serving List) (the
“Serving List”), completed by JH for April 20, 2016 and a Serving List
completed by JH for April 30, 2017, as she went about serving NORIs to
different tenants of the complex. The said Serving Lists bear the signatures of
some tenants who were home and accepted personal service of the NORIs. When
tenants, such as the Tenant here, were not in the unit, the service list
indicates JH placed the NORI under the door to the unit and the document bears
her signature for those units.
3.      The
residential complex contains sixty-four units. JH further testified she has
been superintendent of the complex for four years and her duties include
serving notices to the tenants. In the case of NORIs, the Landlord’s head
office prepares the documents, the documents are delivered to JH and she serves
the documents to the named tenants. JH added service of notices to tenants is
“part of my job” and “If I don’t do my job, I lose my apartment.”   
4.      The
Tenant’s position, as articulated by his agent, AS, is that, on a balance of
probabilities, JH did not serve the two NORIs at issue here to the Tenant on
the dates stated. AS submits I should so find because other tenants who live in
two units on the same floor similarly did not receive a NORI in 2016,
notwithstanding they took possession of their respective units on different
dates and, accordingly, would have to be served NORIs on different dates.
5.      AS further
submitted I should give JH’s testimony little or no weight as JH is an employee
of the Landlord and, as such, it is in her best interest to testify she served
the NORIs to the Tenant on the dates stated.
6.      With
respect to the tenants on the same floor not being served with NORIs in 2016,
even if I accept that as fact, it does not necessarily follow the Tenant here
was not served—this is especially so as the Tenant was not present to provide
testimony going to the what transpired on April 20, 2016 and April 30, 2017,
when JH testified she served the two NORIs at issue to the Tenant and, further,
as AS testified she was not present in the unit on the said dates. In my view,
a finding the Tenant was not served with the NORIs simply because two other
units, or more, on the same floor were not served would be a finding of fact
based on pure speculation and/or conjecture and amount to a serious error of
law.
7.      In the
end, all I really have is JH’s affirmed, uncontradicted and unshaken testimony
she served the two notices to the Tenant on the dates stated. In the circumstances, I am obligated to apply, to JH’s
testimony,
the principle from Maldonado v. M.E.I., 1979 CanLII 4098 (FCA), [1980] 2 F.C 302 (C.A.) at 305,
that when a witness swears to the truth of certain allegations, a presumption
is created that those allegations are true unless there are reasons to doubt
their truthfulness. 
8.      The Landlord
must lead sufficient evidence to establish it is more likely than not the NORIs
at issue were served to the Tenant on the dates alleged. In order
to be successful, the Landlord must prove its case on a balance of
probabilities.
On a balance of probabilities means that the Landlord must show that its
version of events is the more probable and should succeed. Saying something is
proven on a balance of probabilities simply means that it is more likely than
not to have occurred. Further, as the Supreme Court of Canada stated in F.
H. v. McDougall, 2008 SCC 53 (“F. H. v. McDougall”), at paragraph
46, the civil standard of proof requires that evidence “must always be
sufficiently clear, convincing and cogent to satisfy the balance of
probabilities test.” For the reasons that follow, in my view, the Landlord has
discharged its burden of proof. 
9.      I found JH to
be a credible witness. AS was accorded an unimpeded opportunity to
cross-examine JH and, after AS put a few questions to the witness, her
testimony remained unshaken and consistent with the documentary evidence
provided. Moreover, the documentary evidence provided, in the form of the
“Serving Lists” and the photocopies NORIs served to the Tenant, not only
corroborated JH’s testimony but, inherently, greatly assisted the Landlord in
meeting its burden of proof. In particular, and while AS suggested the Serving
Lists may have been prepared ex post facto, I find, on a balance of
probabilities, that not to be the case as, for example, the Service Lists
provided bear the signatures of several tenants of the complex acknowledging
receipt of NORIs on April 20, 2016 and April 30, 2017 and, further, if JH
served NORIs to those other tenants on April 20th and April 30th,
she, in all likelihood, also served the NORIs to the Tenant as such service
could be effected with next to no effort.  
10.   I should also state I
found that JH provided her evidence in a clear and convincing manner. Her
testimony was consistent with the documentary evidence provided and she was
firm in her conviction she would not fail to serve a legal notice to tenants of
the complex because, as superintendent of the complex, such failure to do this
part of her job could lead to her losing her home. As a result of the above I prefer
the Landlord’s evidence and find, on a balance of probabilities, JH served the
two NORIs at issue on April 20, 2016 and April 30, 2017 to the Tenant. 
11.   The Act and the
Board’s Rules require a landlord to provide a tenant with documents, including
NORIs, and, if they are served in accordance with the Act and Rules, they are
deemed to have been served whether the tenant receives them or not. It is only
when documents are not served in accordance with one of the permissible methods
set out in subsection 191(1) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
(the 'Act') or
Rule 5 that a landlord must prove the tenant actually received them (pursuant
to subsection 191(2) of the Act). Here, the Landlord’s evidence is that the
NORIs were served to the Tenant, on April 20, 2016 and on April 30, 2017, in accordance with
one of the permissible methods set out in subsection 191(1) of the Act and, in
the absence of credible and reliable evidence to the contrary, I find, on a
balance of probabilities, that the NORIs were served to the Tenant as JH
testified.
Therefore, the N4 notice of termination served to the Tenant
on October 31, 2017, is valid.
The
Landlord’s Application
12.   The Tenant
has not paid the total rent he was required to pay for the period from February
1, 2016 to February 28, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a
Notice of Termination effective November 15, 2017.
13.   The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,275.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
14.   Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from August 1, 2010
to November 15, 2017.
15.   The Tenant
paid $4,202.58 after the application was filed.
16.   I asked AS
if she wished to make submissions, on behalf of the Tenant, going to relief from
eviction pursuant to section 83 of the Act and AS stated the Tenant “can pay
within eleven days.” Therefore, having considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), I find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before March 11, 2018.
2.      As
of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation
the Landlord is entitled to by $617.40*.
3.      However,
the Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the
Landlord owes the Tenant:
$47.30 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting March 1, 2018
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit, and $190.00 for the cost of
filing the application.
4.      The
Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as
a result of this order.
5.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before March 11, 2018, then starting March 12,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
6.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 12, 2018.
7.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, he must pay to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $1,087.32 if the payment is made on or before February 28, 2018, or
ii)       $2,525.90 if the payment is made on or before March 11, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after March 12, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period
of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
