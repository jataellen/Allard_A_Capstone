Order under Section 21.2
of the 
Statutory Powers
Procedure Act 
and the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 










 

Review Order
 
AE (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict SC and JB (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay
the rent that the Tenants owe (L1 application). The Landlord also filed an L2
application. 
 
The Landlord’s application was resolved by order
CEL-73107-18, issued on February 14, 2018.
 
On February 28, 2018, the Tenants requested a review
of that order.
 
The Tenants’ review request was heard in Mississauga
on March 15, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s agent/son, AE, the
Landlord's Legal Representative, HR, and the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations and Reasons:
 
1.     
The Landlord’s L2
application was withdrawn at the prior hearing on February 13, 2018.
2.     
There is a serious error in
the order regarding the amount of rent arrears. As a result, the Tenants’ review
request was granted at the hearing and the L1 application was re-heard.
3.     
The interim order issued on
February 28, 2018 requires the Tenants to pay one month’s rent to the Board in
trust on or before March 12, 2018. The Tenants did not comply with the interim
order. No amount was paid to the Board. The Tenants stated that they did not
make the payment because they are planning on moving out of the rental unit at
the end of March and the last month's rent deposit will cover the March rent. 
4.     
The Landlord’s agent/son
lives in the unit above the Tenants and acts as the property manager for the
rental unit.
5.     
The Tenants have not paid
$2,500.00 the total rent they were required to pay for the period from January
1, 2018 to March 31, 2018. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice
of Termination effective January 16, 2018.
6.     
The monthly rent is
$1,500.00. There is no dispute that Ontario Work’s (OW) pays $1,000.00 each
month directly to the Landlord and the Tenants are responsible for paying the
remaining $500.00 to the Landlord.
7.     
OW paid the Landlord
$1,000.00 towards the February 2018 rent. This is not disputed. However, the
Landlord’s son unilaterally applied $850.00 of that amount towards utility
bills that are allegedly owing and applied the $150.00 remaining to the rent
arrears.
8.     
Since the tenancy began in
August 2017, it has been clear that the amount paid by OW on behalf of the
Tenants is for rent. Neither the Landlord nor her agent/son can unilaterally
decide to apply the amount OW pays for rent to another debt that they believe
the Tenants owe.
9.     
The Landlord argued that the
utility bills should be considered to be rent so the $1,000.00 OW payment can
be applied to those bills. The utilities are not included in the rent. The
amount owing for utilities fluctuates each month. This is not disputed. 
10.  
Since the amount owing for
utilities fluctuates each month the amount cannot be considered to be rent
since rent can only increase once per year and only by a set guideline amount
in accordance with sections 119 and 120 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006, (the ‘Act’). Also a 90
day written notice of the increase must be given to the Tenants or the increase
is void under section 116 of the Act.
11.  
Therefore, the utilities are
not rent and the full $1,000.00 paid for February rent by OW is credited to the
rent arrears owing under this order.
12.  
There is no dispute that
there is a balance of $500.00 owing for the February 2018 rent. 
13.  
There is also no dispute
that the full March rent of $1,500.00 is owing. However, the Tenants are
planning on moving out of the rental unit on March 31st and the last
month's rent deposit will cover the March rent.
14.  
The only dispute regarding
the amount of rent owing relates to the January rent. OW paid $1,000.00 towards
the January rent. The Landlord alleges that the Tenants did not pay the $500.00
balance.
15.  
The Tenants allege that they
paid the $500.00 balance for January rent in cash to the Landlord’s son. They
have no rent receipt for the payment. They claim that the Landlord’s son
refused to give them a receipt.
16.  
The Tenants provided bank
records which show a withdrawal of $465.00 on December 19, 2017. They claim
this withdrawal together with $35.00 cash they had on hand was paid to the
Landlord’s son in December 2017 in advance for the January 2018 rent.
17.  
The Landlord’s son stated
that he did not give a receipt for the January rent because the $500.00 payment
was never made. He produced his receipt book at the hearing which showed that receipts
have been given for other cash payments the Tenants made.
18.  
The Landlord’s son also
provided a copy of text message from the female Tenant which acknowledges that
$500.00 is owing.
19.  
The bank withdrawal of
$465.00 in December 2017 does not establish that the Landlord actually received
$500.00 for the January rent.
20.  
Cash payments are very
difficult to establish without a receipt or other documentation. Simply stating
that the rent was paid is insufficient to establish that the payment was made. 
21.  
Based on the evidence
presented, I am not satisfied that $500.00 was paid towards the January rent.
22.  
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,500.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
23.  
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from July 31, 2017 to January 16, 2018
(the termination date in the N4 notice).
24.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until March 31, 2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of
the Act. The Tenants have plans to move out on this date. The Landlord was not
unduly opposed to this date since there is a last month's rent deposit to apply
to the March rent.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Tenants’ review request
is granted. Order CEL-73107-18, issued on February 14, 2018, is cancelled and
replaced by the following: 
2.     
The Landlord’s L2
application is withdrawn.
3.     
Unless the Tenants void the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before March 31,
2018.
4.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $334.30*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to March 19, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
5.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $49.32 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting March 20, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
6.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
7.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing
on or before March 31, 2018, the
Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from April 1, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
8.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 31, 2018, then starting April 1, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
9.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 1, 2018.
10.  
If, on or before March 31,
2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $2,690.00** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
11.  
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to void this order if
they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after April 1, 2018
but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
