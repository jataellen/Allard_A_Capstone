Review Order
 
Nasser Bonakdarian (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Deepu
Kang (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved by order TSL-07388-19 issued on
February 13, 2020. On February 20, 2020, the Tenant requested a review
of the order.
The request
was heard by teleconference on May 10, 2021.
 
The Landlord,
the Landlord’s legal representative M. Yarmus, and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Review
 
1.    
The Tenant’s
request for a review is based on the ground
of serious error.
 
2.    
The Tenant alleged that the Member made the following errors in the order:
 
(a)  
failed to properly
consider previous orders granting rent reductions for the Landlord’s failure to maintain the air
conditioning and the Landlord’s failure to provide
rent receipts;
 
(b)  
failed to consider
evidence provided by the Tenant about the rent receipt issue; and
 
(c)  
made errors in calculating the amount of rent owed by the Tenant.




 
 
 
 
Rent receipts
 
3.    
By order
TSL-75068-16/TST-73374-16 issued May 11, 2017, the Landlord was required to provide the Tenant with rent receipts
for any rent the Tenant paid for January 2008 to the date of the order. The Landlord was required to provide
these receipts no later than May 31,
2017, otherwise, starting June 1, 2017, the Tenant could deduct $25.00 from the monthly
rent.
 
4.    
It is uncontested that
the Tenant raised this issue at the hearing that gave rise to the order under review, which took place on
December 10, 2019. The order under review does not consider this issue at all. I find that it
was a serious error to do so.
 
5.    
At the review hearing I
heard submissions from both parties about this issue and it became clear that I did not have all of
the relevant evidence, so I directed the parties to give me post-hearing submissions. In particular, I directed the
Landlord’s representative to file a
copy of all rent receipts that had been provided to the Tenant for the relevant months
(as stated in order
TSL-75068-16/ TST-73374-16).
 
6.    
The Landlord’s
representative filed post-hearing submissions on May 17, 2021 including rent receipts from 2009 to 2015. The following relevant
rent receipts were not provided:
 
a)    
Any receipts
from 2008;
b)    
January and March 2010;
c)     
July, October,
and December 2011;
d)     June and November
2012;
e)     January,
February, and December
2013;
f)      
December 2015;
g)    
Any receipts
from 2016;
h)    
January, February,
March, April, or May 2017.
 
7.    
The Landlord’s
representative also filed some correspondence about receipts being sent to the Tenant but none of this
correspondence states what receipts are sent for what dates and so I cannot conclude from this correspondence that any
receipts were sent to the Tenant
other than those sent in the post-hearing submissions.
 
8.    
Even assuming that the
receipts filed as post-hearing submissions were all sent to the Tenant, based on the lack of many of the
receipts that were ordered to be provided, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Landlord failed to
comply with the requirement in order
TSL-75068-16/TST-73374-16 to provide rent receipts for January 2008 to May 2017.
 
9.    
I therefore find that
the Tenant was entitled to a reduction in rent of $25.00 from June 1, 2017 to
the end of her tenancy on September 30, 2020.
 
Air conditioning




 
 
 
10.  By order TSL-75068-16/TST-73374-16 issued
May 11, 2017, the Landlord was required to
repair the air conditioning unit in the rental unit no later than May 31, 2019.
The order further directed that if
the Landlord failed to comply with this term of the order, the Tenant could deduct
$100.00 per month from her rent commencing June 1,
2017.
 
11.  In October 2018 the Tenant filed multiple
applications against the Landlord, including a
T6 application in which she complained that the air conditioning unit in
the rental unit was still not
working properly. That application was resolved by order TST-00448-18, issued March 25, 2019, mostly on consent. One of
the consent terms of the order was as follows:
 
The Tenant shall provide the Landlord with names and contact information
for three electricians and three HVAC technicians who would be qualified to assess the need for repairs for the issues listed at
paragraphs 6 and 7 of TSL-75068-16/TST-73374-
16
 
12.  The order under review does consider some
of the evidence submitted by the parties but
does not consider all of the relevant evidence. I find this to be an
error. However, after considering all
of the evidence I have come to the same conclusion as was reached in the order under
review.
 
13.  The Landlord submitted a receipt from an
HVAC contractor dated June 27, 2017 indicating
that the air conditioning unit was inspected as was the thermostat and other associated equipment and that all
(including air flow) was found to be in “good work condition.” This alone could have resolved the issue at the
hearing on January 22, 2019 (which
gave rise to the order issued on March 25, 2019) if the parties had not
consented to resolve the issue by the
Tenant providing information for technicians to examine the air conditioning unit.
 
14.  By email sent to the Tenant on April 29,
2019, the Landlord requested that the Tenant
provide the information required by order TST-00448-18 no later than May
6, 2019, otherwise the Landlord
would consider the issue resolved.
 
15.  The Tenant provided the information
required by order TST-00448-18 to the Landlord on October 10, 2019.
 
16.  On November 1, 2019 the Landlord had the
air conditioning unit inspected by one of the
HVAC technicians whose information was provided by the Tenant. The
invoice from the HVAC technician
indicates that the heat was working normally and that the cooling could not be assessed because the “building
chillers” had been turned off. The invoice states that the air conditioning could not be inspected until the air
conditioning in the building is turned on.
 
17.  Based on the receipt from the HVAC
contractor dated June 27, 2017, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the air conditioning unit was found to
be in good working order at that time. There is
no reason to believe that the air
conditioning problem alleged by the Tenant had spontaneously resolved
with no intervention and so I find that the Landlord




 
had complied
with the requirement in order TSL-75068-16/TST-73374-16 issued May 11, 2017 to
repair the air conditioner by May
31, 2017.
 
18.  Alternatively, even if the finding above is
incorrect, I would still find that the Landlord complied with order TSL-75068-16/TST-73374-16. I say this
because when the parties had
difficulty agreeing on the state of the air conditioner, their point of
contention was who had done the
inspecting. They resolved that issue by agreeing that the Landlord would have the air conditioner inspected
by someone the Tenant suggests. The Tenant took
more than six months to provide this information. I note that three of these
months (June, July, and August) are
the hottest months in the summer. Once the Tenant finally provided the information, it was autumn
and so it was cooler outside and the building air conditioning was not in operation. The Tenant’s delay in
providing this information resulted
in making it impossible for the
Landlord to comply.
 
19.  I also note that there was no evidence that
the Tenant complained about the air conditioning
between March 25, 2019 and October 10, 2019 or after the failed inspection in November 2019. From the Tenant’s
apparent lack of interest in providing the names and contact information for HVAC inspectors and her lack of
complaints about the air conditioning
in 2019, I draw an inference that there was no issue with the air conditioning during this time. There was no evidence
given by either party that any technician repaired or even examined the air conditioner between May 11, 2017 and
November 2019 other than the one who
found it to be in good working order in June 2017 and the one who could not examine its operation in
November 2019. The air conditioner would not have fixed itself spontaneously and so the most logical
conclusion is that it was not in disrepair.
 
 
Disposition on review
 
20.  Based on my finding of serious error
respecting the rent receipt issue, the order issued February 13, 2020 shall be cancelled. This error resulted in an
error in the amount owed by the
Tenant and the most reasonable remedy is to revisit the amount owed by the Tenant.
 
L1 application
 
21.  The Landlord’s L1 application was heard de novo at the review hearing.
 
22.  The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on September 30, 2020.
 
23.  It is uncontested that if the Tenant was
not entitled to any deductions from order TSL-
75068-16/TST-73374-16, she would be in arrears. The arrears arise from
her deductions of these amounts from
her rent. There is also a small calculation error in the Landlord’s records, which will be addressed below.
 
24.  From June 2017 to the end of the tenancy,
the Tenant’s monthly rent was $1,600.00. During this time (except
for the month of May 2019, discussed
below) the Tenant
paid
$1,410.00 per
month, which is $190.00 short. Based on my findings above, during this time she was entitled to deduct $25.00 per month, and so
she is in arrears of rent
of




 
$165.00 for each
of these months (except May 2019, for which the arrears amount is slightly
different, as explained
below).
 
25.  For the month of May 2019 the Tenant was
also entitled to deduct the following amounts,
as directed by order TST-00448-18, issued March 25, 2019:
 
(a)  
$600.00 rent abatement for harassment;
(b)  
$44.96 for interest on the rent deposit;
(c)  
$100.00 for a key deposit;
and
(d)  
$50.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
26.  The order also provided that if these
amounts were not paid by the Landlord by April 8, 2019, interest would start to accrue at 3.00% annually on the
outstanding balance. The Landlord did
not pay these amounts to the Tenant and she deducted them from her rent in May 2019, which means interest accrued
from April 9, 2019 to April 30, 2019. The total of these amounts
is $794.96 and I have
calculated the interest
on this amount to be
$1.44.
 
27.  For the month of May 2019, as for all of
the material months, the Tenant was also entitled to deduct $25.00 for the rent receipt issue. After deducting
$794.96, $1.44, and $25.00 from the
monthly rent, the amount payable by the Tenant for May 2019 was $778.60. The Tenant paid $613.39 that month, leaving arrears of $165.21.
 
28.  Based on the above, the total arrears
owed by the Tenant is $6,600.21.
 
29.  At the review hearing the Tenant submitted
that it was improper for the Landlord to include
June 2017 as a month that she was in arrears. The Tenant provided no reasonable or cogent explanation for this
submission. The application claims arrears starting
June 1, 2017 and the parties agree that the arrears started on that date. There
is no reason to conclude that the
Landlord’s claim for arrears ought to have started a month earlier.
 
30.  The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,600.00
from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
31. 
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from February 1, 2019 to August
31, 2020 (the rent deposit is applied to September 2020 and so no interest is
due for that month). I have calculated
this interest to be $49.88.
 
32.  By order TST-14739-20, issued September 15,
2021, the Landlord is ordered to pay the Tenant
$3,550.00. This amount shall be set off against the full amount owed by the Tenant pursuant to this order.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TSL-07388-19,
issued on February 13, 2020, is cancelled and is replaced by the following order:




 
2.    
The tenancy is
terminated as of September 30, 2020, the date the Tenant gave vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $1,400.12.*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to September 30,
2020, less the amount owed to the Tenant pursuant
to order TST-14739-20, the rent deposit, and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing by October 31, 2021, the Tenant will owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from November 1, 2021 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
