Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-03588-19
 











 
 
 

M.T. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict M. S. and S. S.(the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Whitby on October 11,
2019 and then re-heard on March 11, 2020.
 
The Landlord and the second-named
Tenant above (the ‘Tenant’) attended the hearing held on March 11, 2020.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants were both in
possession when this application was filed. 
2.     
There is no dispute that the
Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the
period from July 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 6, 2019.
3.     
The Tenants paid $900.00
after the application was filed.
4.     
The lawful monthly rent is
$1,900.00.
5.     
The parties agree that the
arrears of rent owing for the period ending March 31, 2020 total $16,200.00. 
6.     
The Landlord incurred costs
of $175.00 for filing the application and is entitled to reimbursement of those
costs.
7.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,900.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
8.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from October 25, 2018 to August 6, 2019
totalling $26.80.
9.     
The only real dispute
between the parties is with respect to the Tenant’s request for relief. She
wants conditional relief in the form of a repayment plan. She wants to pay
$1,600.00 towards the rent arrears every month along with the monthly rent as
it comes due. That represents an eleven month long repayment plan. The Landlord
opposes any relief from eviction. 
10.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
the conditional relief from eviction the Tenant seeks. 
11.  
The Tenant’s own testimony
indicates she cannot afford the repayment plan proposed. The Tenant says her
mother is living with her and has agreed to help out. That is the only way the
Tenant could remotely afford the proposed repayment plan. But the Tenant’s
mother has no legal obligation to pay the Landlord, and did not attend the
hearing to testify as to her willingness to support the Tenant. 
12.  
When I explained this to the
Tenant she suggested maybe a more modest repayment plan would be appropriate. 
13.  
This is a relatively new
tenancy. The application indicates it started in the fall of 2018. Given the
large amount owing to the Landlord, a more practical repayment plan would last
longer than the length of the tenancy to date and that seems most unfair to the
Landlord. 
14.  
More importantly perhaps,
the Tenant’s behaviour to date suggests she cannot be relied on to comply with
any promises to pay the Landlord. No payment has been made since August of
2019. She says she has been using her income to pay off debts and loans. She
appears to be judgement proof. 
15.  
So the Tenant essentially
asks the Board and the Landlord to trust her when she has proven most
untrustworthy in the past. 
16.  
Given all of the above, I am
satisfied that it would be unfair to impose on the Landlord any form of
repayment plan. The Tenant’s promises to pay are unreliable; and it is unfair
to expect the Landlord to carry such a large debt simply because the Tenant
decided to pay off other debts and loans rather than honouring her obligation
to the Landlord.
17.  
That being said, I am
mindful of the difficulties moving and the presence of two young children in
the rental unit. Some delay in eviction may be justifiable. But any significant
delay would be highly prejudicial to the Landlord as he has exhausted his savings
as a result of the Tenants’ behaviour. Therefore, I find that it would not be
unfair to postpone the eviction until March 31, 2020 pursuant to subsection
83(1)(b) of the Act. But in order to minimise the prejudice to the Landlord, the
Landlord will be authorised to file the order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) immediately. 
18.  
This order contains all of
the reasons for the decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.
It is ordered that:
1.     
Unless the Tenants void the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before March
31, 2020.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $13,191.39*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to March 13, 2020, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $62.47 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting March 14, 2020 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March 24, 2020, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from March
25, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
The Landlord may file this
order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) at any time so that the
eviction may be enforced. However, upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord, only on or after April 1, 2020.
7.     
If, on or before March 31,
2020, the Tenants pay the amount of $16,375.00** to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
8.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after April 1, 2020
but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
