K.P.M. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict D.T. and M. M. T. (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe. L1 application
 
And
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenants because they have been persistently late in
paying their rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date. L2 application
 
This combined application was heard in Toronto on
January 31, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, C.K.
and the Tenant D.T. attended the hearing.
 
It is determined that:
 
L1 application
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
$818.99 of the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from
November 1, 2015 to January 31, 2018. Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination.
2.     
The Tenants also owe the
Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
3.     
The total amount owing is
$1,008.99($818.99 + $190.00).
4.     
The Tenant at the hearing
proposed to pay $125.00 every month along with the monthly rent to pay all of
the rent arrears. The Tenant then made a post hearing submission to pay $150.00
every month along with the monthly rent to pay all of the rent arrears.
5.     
The Landlord did not accept
the Tenant’s payment plan and was seeking eviction.
6.     
I find that the Tenants have
made an effort and have paid $4,000.00 to the Landlord after the application
was filed. I find that the Tenant was motivated and shall be given a chance to
pay all of the rent arrears.
7.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant
relief from eviction subject to the conditions set out in this order pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
L2 application
8.     
The Tenants have
persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
9.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant
relief from eviction subject to the conditions set out in this order pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
L1 application
1.     
The Tenants shall pay the
Landlord the rent for the month of February 2018, no later than February 25,
2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay the
Landlord $1,008.99 as follows:
a)   
On or before March 1, 2018                            $150.00
b)   
On or before April 1, 2018                               $150.00
c)   
On or before May 1, 2018                                $150.00
d)   
On or before June 1, 2018                               $150.00
e)   
On or before July 1, 2018                                $150.00
f)    
On or before August 1, 2018                           $150.00
g)   
On or before September 1,
2018                   $108.99                                                      
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
the Landlord rent owing for the months of March, April, May, June, July, August
and September 2018, no later than the 1st day of each month.
4.     
If the Tenants fails to make
any one of the payments in accordance with this order, the outstanding balance
of any arrears of rent and costs to be paid by the Tenants to the Landlord
pursuant to paragraph 1 of this order shall become immediately due and owing
and the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenants apply to the Board pursuant
to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenants and requiring that the Tenants pay any new arrears, NSF fees and
related charges that became owing on the day after the breach.
L2 application
5.     
If the Tenants void the part of this order
relating to the L1 application as set out in this order, the Tenants shall pay
the monthly rent on or before 1st day of each month, starting October
1, 2018 and continuing up to and including September 1, 2019.
6.     
If the Tenants fail to make
any of the payments as set out in paragraphs 5 above, the Landlord may apply
under section 78 of the Act, within 30 days of the breach, without notice to
the Tenants, for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants.
