Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: SWL-17590-18
 
OI (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict DW (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in [CITY] on
July 9, 2018.
 
The Landlord attended
the hearing.  The Tenant attended the hearing and spoke with Duty Counsel prior
to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from April 1, 2018 to
July 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective May 25, 2018.
 
2.      The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
 
3.      The monthly rent is $761.00.
 
4.     
The Landlord collected a rent
deposit of $750.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from October 1, 2016 to May 25, 2018.
 
6.     
The Tenant paid $750.00
after the application was filed.
 
7.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until July 31, 2018, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of
the Act.  The Tenant said that the reason she had not paid her rent some months
was because her rent was stolen and because she felt bullied by the
exterminator and thought she was being evicted, she had put deposits on other
premises but she had not secured them.  She proposed to pay the arrears by a
pay plan of $75.00 per month.  Since that would take 22 months, I am not
satisfied that it would be fair to the Landlord to grant the Tenant’s request. 
However, since the Landlord is holding a last month's rent deposit, I am not
satisfied that it would be unfair to the Landlord to allow the Tenant a short
extension until August 15, 2018, to either pay the arrears and costs or vacate.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before August
15, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $413.51*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to July 16, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $25.02 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
July 17, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before July 27, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from July 28,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before August 15, 2018, then starting August 16, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction
may be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after August 16, 2018.
 
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $1,715.00 if the payment is made on or before July 31, 2018, or
ii)       $2,476.00 if the payment is made on or before August 15, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after August 16, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
