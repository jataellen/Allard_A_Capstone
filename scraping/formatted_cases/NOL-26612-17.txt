Order under Section 69 & 89
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-26612-17










 




In
  the matter of:


 
 


 




 


 


 




Between:


DM


Landlord




 


 


 




 


And


 




 


 


 




 


AA
BA
KA


Tenants




 


 


 



 
DM
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict BA, KA
and AA (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe and because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone
they permitted in the residential complex have wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the damage. 
 
This
application was heard in Sudbury on February 17, 2017.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant, BA, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from November 1, 2016 to February 28, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination.
2.      The
Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.  
3.      The
monthly rent is $1,100.00. 
4.      The
Tenants made no payment after the application was filed. 
5.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,100.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
6.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from March 1, 2014
to January 31, 2017.
 
                                                                                                                        Order

Number: NOL-26612-17
7.      BA
stated that the Tenants wish to preserve the tenancy.  The rent fell into
arrears because she paid her daughter’s rent at school, helped pay for a family
member’s funeral costs, and she was off work for two weeks.  BA proposed a
repayment plan for the arrears which would have all arrears and costs paid by
mid-June together with new rent.
8.      BA
is returning to work and will pay the arrears sooner when she gets her income
tax refund.
9.      The
Landlord requested the tenancy be terminated.  This is not the first time the
Tenants have gone into arrears or that he has applied for a Board order.  He
acknowledged that a previous payment plan was honoured but the Tenants soon
fell back into being late with rent.  The Landlord stated that it was
inappropriate for BA to use her income to pay for other expenses before
ensuring the rent was paid to ensure her tenancy.
L2
– Wilful or Negligent Damage
10.   The
Landlord discovered the rental unit to be damaged by the Tenants dog in August,
2016.  He served a Notice to Terminate a Tenancy Early (Form N5) at the time
but although it was not voided he did not file an application for termination
of the tenancy within 30 days of the termination date in the notice in
accordance with Section 69 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’).
11.   The
Landlord served a second “first” N 5 termination notice under Section 62 of the
Act on December 19, 2016.  The termination date in this notice is January 4,
2017.  The Landlord did not comply with subsection 62(2)(a) of the Act which
requires the termination date be no earlier than 20 days from the date it is
given.  Accordingly the notice is defective and the Landlord’s application for
termination of the tenancy for wilful or negligent damage to the rental unit
cannot be considered.
12.   The
Landlord also applied to be compensated for the damage and this portion of the
Landlord’s application is properly before the Board in the L2 application.
13.   The
Landlord provided photographs taken in the rental unit in 2013 prior to the
tenancy starting.  The rental unit is in good condition.  The Landlord stated
that it had been renovated through an insurance claim after a fire, including
new flooring.
14.   The
photographs show damage to window screens and significant scratching of the
wood and paid around the windows.  The hardwood stairs are also badly scratched
and required refinishing.  There are large holes in the drywall in several
places throughout the rental unit. 
15.   The
Landlord stated that the upstairs bedroom laminate floor must be replaced as
the Tenants dog was allowed to urinate and defecate on the floor.  A photograph
shows the room with an upside down box spring and significant animal feces on
throughout the room.
                                                                                                                      Order

Number: NOL-26612-17
16.   BA
stated she was away and thought her daughter would attend to the dog.  BA did
not deny the damage shown in the photographs and it is understood it is caused
by her dog.
17.   BA
stated that she wishes to make the repairs.  BA has been aware since August,
2016 when the first N 5 notice was served that the Landlord was seeking
compensation for damage.  Since that date the Tenants have not done anything to
repair the damage.
18.   The
Landlord’s claim for costs to repair the damage is $3,000.00.  The Landlord
stated the damage is much higher than the amount claimed and based on his
experience as a Landlord may be as much as $10,000.00.   The costs include new
flooring, drywall repair, painting and repair of screens.  There is also the
cost to refinish the hardwood stairs and the wood around the windows.  I am
satisfied the amount requested by the Landlord is reasonable in the
circumstances and based on the amount of damage.
19.   The
Tenants have not demonstrated any respect for the Landlord’s property.   
20.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances (the Tenants reasons for
rent arrears, the Tenants proposed repayment plan, the Landlord’s fatigue with
seeking rent, the condition of the rental unit and the amount of damages) in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before March 5, 2017.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $2,340.63*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to February 22, 2017, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $36.16 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 23, 2017 to the date they move out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $3,000.00 for the cost of repairing
damages to the rental unit.
5.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
6.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March
5, 2017, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from March 6, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
                                                                                                                                    Order

Number: NOL-26612-17
7.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before March 5, 2017, then starting March 6,
2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 6, 2017.
9.      If
the Tenants wish to void this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $3,990.00 if the payment is made on or before February 28, 2017, or
ii)       $5,090.00 if the payment is made on or before March 5, 2017**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
10.   The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after March 6, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
