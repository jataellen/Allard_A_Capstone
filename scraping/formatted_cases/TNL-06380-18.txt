Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: TNL-06380-18
 










 

AS and AS (the
'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict JH, BP and
BJP (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe.
 
This application was
heard in Newmarket on August 1, 2018.
 
ME for
the Landlords and the Tenant, JH attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from April 15, 2018 to August 14, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlords
served a Notice of Termination effective July 3, 2018.
2.      The
monthly rent is due on the 15th of each month.
3.      The
Landlords collected a rent deposit of $1,750.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlords.
4.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from November 19,
2017 to July 3, 2018.
5.      The
Tenants intend to move out by October 15, 2018.
6.      The
Tenant, JH requested a payment plan in which the ‘gentleman’ living at the unit
will pay $850.00 every two weeks towards arrears, the Tenant would pay the rent
for August 15, 2018 by August 20, 2018 and the last month’s rent deposit would
be applied to the rent for September 15th to October 14, 2018. The
Tenant JH is the single mother of three children aged 13, 11 and 5 years old.
Her child tax credit benefit has been held back for two months and she expects
to have that money by August 20, 2018.
7.      MH
for the Landlords was opposed to a payment plan or any delay in the eviction.
The tenancy began in November 2017 and no payment has been received since a
$1,000.00 payment in May 2018. The Landlords, while not unsympathetic to the
Tenants’ situation, have a mortgage to pay.
8.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), in
particular that this is relatively short tenancy, that the plan relies on
significant payments from an individual who was not at the hearing and find
that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.
It is
ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before August 19, 2018.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $2,801.40*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to August 8, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $57.53 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting August 9, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before August
19, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from August 20, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before August 19, 2018, then starting August 20,
2018, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after August 20,
2018.
8.      If
the Tenants wish to void this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to
the Landlords or to the Board in trust:
i)        $6,175.00 if the payment is made on or before August 14, 2018, or
ii)       $7,925.00 if the payment is made on or before August 19, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after August 20, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlords. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
