Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 











 
 

DJ (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict JR (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Mississauga on April 18,
2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
At the hearing the Tenant raised
the following issues pursuant to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'):
a)   
Lack of heat;
b)   
Mould.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from December 1, 2017
to April 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective March 2, 2018.
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,750.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 30, 2017 to March 2, 2018.
Section 82 issues
Law
4.     
Section 20(1) of the Act obligates
a Landlord to maintain a unit in a good state of repair.
5.     
In Onyskiw v. CJM
Property Management, 2016 ONCA 477, the
Court of Appeal determined that a contextual approach should be adopted when
considering a landlord’s potential breach of subsection 20(1) of the Act and a breach will not be found if the landlord’s response
to a maintenance issue was reasonable in the circumstances.
6.     
I must also apply subsection 30(2) of the Act, and consider whether the tenant, or former tenant, advised
the landlord of the alleged breaches before applying to the Board, and the
parties’ duty to mitigate found in section 16 of the Act.
 
Heat
7.     
The tenancy commenced as of
October 1, 2017.  The monthly rent is $1,756.50.
8.     
The unit is a condominium. 
The Landlord is responsible for the provision of heat. There is a thermostat in
the unit.
9.     
The Tenant testified that
there has been no heat in the unit since October 1, 2017.  She said the boiler
system in the complex requires repair.
10.  
The building management
turned the heat on in the complex as of October 23, 2017 and informed residents
to contact management if they are unable to control heat in the unit. The
Tenant submitted a copy of this notice from the condominium management.
11.  
The condominium management
became aware of issues with the boiler system in approximately mid-December
2017. The condominium management commenced replacement of the boiler with two
boilers although one of the new boilers was capable of providing sufficient
heat to the complex.
12.  
On or about December 18,
2017 a contractor inspected the heating system in the unit and determined that
a new actuator was required as well as replacement of a good portion of the piping.
The Tenant submitted a copy of an email from the condominium management
containing this information.  The Tenant forwarded this email to the City of
Mississauga municipal law enforcement officer (‘City’).  
13.  
On December 19, 2017 the
condominium manager informed the Tenant that the heat was fully functional in
her unit.  The Tenant submitted this email.
14.  
The Landlord became aware
about the heat issue on or about January 9, 2018 and took steps to follow up
with the condominium management in an effort to resolve the heat issue.  The
Landlord submitted an email he sent to the condominium management on January 9th
to corroborate his testimony.
15.  
On January 9, 2018 the
Landlord sent a notice to the Tenant regarding the boiler repairs and
replacement and offered to cover 50% of the cost to purchase a heater to warm
up the unit.
16.  
On February 9, 2018 the
condominium manager informed the Landlord and Tenant that one boiler was
replaced.
17.  
On February 13, 2018 the
condominium management informed the City that installation of the first boiler was
to be completed on February 16, 2018.  This email was submitted by the
Landlord.
18.  
In an email dated February
24, 2018, the Landlord informed the Tenant that a new boiler was to be
installed and operational on February 23rd and heat should be
available over the weekend.
19.  
The Landlord breached
section 20 of the Act by failing to provide a reasonable supply of heat.  It is
more probable than not that there was inadequate heat in the unit from
mid-December 2017 until March 6, 2018 because the boiler system was not
functioning properly.  The condominium management informed the Tenant that heat
was fully functional in her unit however the condominium manager also informed
the Tenant on January 2, 2018 that the boilers cannot keep up with the demand
for heat.  On January 9, 2018 the Landlord acknowledged that the heat issue
continued and offered to assist with the purchase of a second heater.  On
February 9, 2018 the Landlord followed up with the condominium management
inquiring when the heat would be back on in the unit.  On March 6, 2018 the
temperature in the unit was 75 degrees Celsius and the condominium management
confirmed that no further work is required in the unit.  The Landlord has not
received any order from the City regarding inadequate heat and the evidence
demonstrates that the City was involved in the resolution of the heat issue.
20.  
The Tenant is entitled to an
abatement of 50% from January 9, 2018 (the date when she informed the Landlord)
to March 6, 2018 when the heat issue was resolved for $1,617.28.  The Tenant
was still able to reside in the unit and the Landlord took reasonable steps to respond
to the Tenant’s complaints, however the Tenant was impacted with inadequate
heat despite the Landlord’s efforts.  She sent her daughter to live elsewhere
because of the lack of heat in the unit.
Mould
21.  
The Tenant testified that
there was mould in the windows in the unit as well as condensation likely
because of the inadequate heat.  She submitted photos taken in February 2018 of
the mould around the windows.
22.  
The Landlord became aware
incidentally about the mould in mid-February 2018.  He contacted various mould
remediation companies and arranged for a unit inspection with a mould inspector
on March 13, 2018.  A quote from GTA Mold Removal dated March 13, 2018 was
submitted.
23.  
The Landlord used over the
counter products to clean up the mould on April 16, 2018 and provided the
Tenant with a dehumidifier to prevent reoccurrence of condensation, the likely
cause of the mould.
24.  
There is no breach of
section 20 regarding the mould issue.  The Landlord responded promptly and
reasonably upon discovering mould around the windows.  The mould was resolved
by cleaning the surfaces which indicates that the impact to the Tenant was
minimal.  This claim is dismissed.
Relief from eviction
25.  
The Tenant requested a few
months to repay the arrears.
26.  
The Landlord testified that
there have been no payments of rent since December 2017 and he has been
carrying the costs of the unit on his own. The substantial arrears are
stressing the financial resources of the Landlord and his family.
27.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act. There are substantial arrears ($5,940.22) to April
30, 2018.  The Tenant paid partial rent for December 2017 and January 2018 and
has not paid any rent since that time.  The Landlord is financially stressed
because of the arrears. The amount of rent owed is reduced and the opportunity
remains for the Tenant to pay the amount owing to void the order is she chooses
to do so. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before May 7,
2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $3,665.18*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to April 26, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit and less the amount of the abatement the Landlord owes the
Tenant.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $57.75 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
April 27, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May 7, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from May 8,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before May 7, 2018, then starting May 8, 2018, the Landlord may file this
order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 8, 2018.
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $5,940.22 if the payment is made on or before April 30, 2018, or
ii)       $7,696.72 if the payment is made on or before May 7, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
 
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after May 8, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
