Residential Tenancies Act, 2006

MG
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict (‘ZB’)
and (‘SB’, the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe; and because the Landlord has entered into an agreement of purchase
and sale of the rental unit and the purchaser requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This
application was heard in Newmarket on February 3, 2020.
 
The Landlord’s representative, AV, the Tenants and the Tenants’
representative, GO, attended the hearing.  The Landlords’ witnesses, (‘GS’) and
(‘CM’), and the Tenants’ foreign language interpreter, AH, also attended the
hearing.  
 
The Landlords’ witnesses and the Tenant SB gave evidence at the
hearing.   
 
Determinations:
 
The Application for Non-payment of Rent
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the
period from October 1, 2019 to February 29, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective January 6, 2020.
 
2.      At
the hearing, the Tenant SB agreed with the Landlord’s evidence of amount of
rent arrears the Tenants owe for the period ending February 29, 2020.  Although
SB at first testified that the rent arrears began to accrue in August 2019 when
the Landlord failed to keep a promise to waive a $3,000.00 debt the Tenants owe
to the Landlord under a previous Board order, SB later agreed that the Landlord’s
promise to pay an amount to the Tenants was conditional upon the Tenants
vacating the rental unit.  SB further testified that, instead of paying rent to
the Landlord, the Tenants spent money on unspecified legal costs they incurred
while extending their status as Permanent Residents of Canada.  SB also agreed
that the Landlord did not at any time waive the Tenants’ obligation to pay
rent.
 
3.      SB
testified that the Tenants can pay the amount they owe to the Landlord over
time.  SB proposed a payment plan that would require the Tenants to pay $500.00
a month toward the $7,300.00 in rent arrears the Tenants owe for the period
ending February 29, 2020.  
 
4.      SB
did not, however, adduce evidence of his household’s income to determine
whether the Tenants can reliably comply with a conditional order.     
 
5.      It
is apparent from SB’s testimony that the Tenants’ household income is limited,
and that affordability is an issue.  According to SB’s own evidence, the
Tenants have been unable to pay the rent and their other expenses.  In the
absence of reliable evidence of the household’s income, SB’s assertion that the
Tenants can now pay the rent, and an additional amount every month toward the
rent arrears, is not credible.
 
6.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $2,100.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from October 1, 2018
to January 6, 2020.
The
Application for the Purchaser’s Own Use
8.      The
Landlord’s witness GS purchased the property from the Landlord.  GS testified
that he intends to reside in the rental unit indefinitely.  GS currently
occupies a rental basement residential unit.  GS testified that he gave his
landlord a notice to terminate the tenancy, as of February 29, 2020.  
 
9.      The
Landlord’s witness CM is the Landlord’s real estate agent.  The Landlord hired
CM to list and sell the rental unit in October 2019.  CM testified that she
located for the Tenants a rental property in the GTA at a comparable monthly
rent.  The Tenants, however, refused to move to that property.  CM testified
that the Tenant ZB demanded $10,000.00 from the Landlord to vacate the rental
unit.
 
10.   SB
did not dispute GS’ evidence that he purchased the property and intends to use
the property as his sole residence.  Indeed, SB congratulated GS at the hearing
and wished GS well.  
 
11.   The
Tenants therefore do not dispute the Landlord’s evidence that the Landlord has
entered into an agreement of purchase and sale for the rental unit, and that
the purchaser GS requires vacant possession of the rental unit for GS’ own
residential use.  
 
12.   At
the hearing, SB asked that the eviction date be postponed to August 31, 2020 to
permit his children to conclude their academic year.  The Tenants’ children,
however, are aged three, four and seven.  I take notice that, if the children
are enrolled in school, their academic year will end in June 2020.  I therefore
reject SB’s submission that the Tenants must remain in the rental unit until August
31, 2020 to accommodate their children’s academic year.
 
13.   I
also find that it would be unfair to postpone the eviction date to even June
30, 2020 to permit the Tenants’ children to finish the academic year, because the
Tenants have not paid rent to the Landlord from August 1, 2019 to February 29,
2020.  Having determined that the rental unit is not affordable, it is more
likely than not that postponing the eviction date beyond a reasonable period
will only result in an increase in the amount of rent arrears the Tenants owe
to the Landlord.  
 
14.   Unreasonably
delaying the eviction date will therefore result in prejudice.
 
15.   However,
the Landlord is holding a rent deposit from the Tenants.  The Tenants will
therefore not accrue any additional rent arrears if they are permitted to
remain in the rental unit until March 31, 2020.
 
16.   In
arriving at this conclusion, I am mindful that GS gave his landlord a notice to
terminate his tenancy as of February 29, 2020.  However, I agree with the
Tenants’ representative that the Landlord did not adduce evidence that GS will
be evicted from his rental unit on that date.  Indeed, section 77 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') permits a landlord to apply to the Board
for an eviction order if the tenant has given a notice of termination of the
tenancy.
 
17.   Therefore,
having considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, I find that it would not be
unfair to postpone the eviction until March 31, 2020, pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. 
 
18.   Because
the tenancy is being terminate for both non-payment of rent and for GS’ own
residential use, this eviction order shall not be voidable under section 74 of
the Act.  Furthermore, because the Tenants do owe rent arrears, they will be
required to pay the Landlord’s Board filing costs.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before March 31, 2020.
 
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $4,749.25*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to February 24, 2020, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $69.04 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 25, 2020 to the date the Tenants move out of
the unit.
 
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March
6, 2020, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from March 7, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before March 31, 2020, then starting April 1,
2020, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 1, 2020.
