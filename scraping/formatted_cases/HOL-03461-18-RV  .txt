Order
under Section 21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-03461-18-RV
 
 
 
Review Order
 
VAA
and VAV,  (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict SE (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This
application was resolved by order HOL-03461-18 issued on November 5, 2018.
 
On
November 16, 2018, the Tenant requested a review of the order.
 
The
request was heard in Newmarket on December 5, 2018.
 
The Landlords and the Tenant attended the hearing. The Landlords
were assisted by their grandson, VK.
 
 Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant was not reasonably able to participate in the hearing that led to the
issuance of order HOL-03461-18 issued on November 5, 2018.
 
2.       The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from August 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018.
 
3.      The
Landlord paid a filing fee to the Sheriff in the amount of $324.00 which is not
refundable.
 
4.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Order
HOL-03461-18 issued on November 2, 2018 is cancelled and replaced by the
following: 
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $6,999.00, which represents the amount of
rent, costs and Sheriff’s fee owing up to December 31, 2018 as follows:
 
a)    $2,225.00
on or before January 19, 2019
b)    $2,225.00
on or before February 16, 2019
c)    $2,225.00
on or before March 15, 2019
d)    $324.00
on or before April 15, 2019
 
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords the monthly rent for the months of
January 2019 to and including April 2019 on or before the first business day of
the month for which the rent becomes due.
4.      If
the Tenant fails to make any one of the payments in accordance with this order,
the outstanding balance of any arrears of rent and costs to be paid by the
Tenant to the Landlord pursuant to paragraph 2 of this order, together with
simple interest, calculated from the day after default, at 3.00% annually on
the balance outstanding, shall become immediately due and owing and the
Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to the Board pursuant to section
78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant and
requiring that the Tenant pay any new arrears, NSF fees and related charges
that become owing after the date of this order.
