            Order
under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Numbers: TNL-00793-18

HL
and JL (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict DC (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because he has been persistently late in paying his rent. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after
the termination date.
 
These
applications were heard in Toronto on January 25, 2018.
 
The Landlords and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
 Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent he was required to pay for the period from
December 1, 2017 to January 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlords
served a Notice of Termination.
 
2.      The
Landlords collected a rent deposit of $750.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
3.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from October 30,
2015.
 
4.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act for the application dealing with arrears of rent. 
 
 
5.      I
have also considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that, if the Tenant voids the eviction for non-payment of rent,  it would
not be unfair to grant relief from eviction for late payment of rent, subject
to  the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and
204(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before February 16, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $719.65*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 31, 2018, after deducting the rent deposit
and interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $24.66 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 1, 2018 to the date he moves out of the unit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before
February16, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from February 17, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 16, 2018, then starting February
17, 2018, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 17,
2018.
 
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, he must pay to
the Landlords or to the Board in trust:
i)        $1,690.00 if the payment is made on or before January 31, 2018, or
ii)       $2,440.00 if the payment is made after January 31, 2018 but on or
before February 16, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 17, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlords. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
 
10.   If
the Tenant voids the eviction portion of this order as permitted by paragraphs
8 or 9, the following provisions will apply:
 
a)    If
the Tenant has voided the eviction portion of this order by payment of
$1,690.00 on or before January 31, 2018, then he shall pay the rent for the
month of February on or before February 16, 2018.
 
b)    On
or before March 2, 2018 the Tenant shall pay the rent for the month of March
2018 plus the $190.00 filing fee that remains outstanding under a prior Board
order.
 
c)    From
April 2018 to and including March 2019 the Tenant shall pay the monthly rent to
the Landlords on or before the first business day of the month for which the
rent becomes due.
 
d)    If
the Tenant fails to make any one of the payments in accordance with paragraph
10 of this order, the Landlords may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to the
Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenant.
