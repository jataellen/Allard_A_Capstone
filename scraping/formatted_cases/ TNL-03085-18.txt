            Order
under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-03085-18



 


 


 



 
 
Numbered
Company Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict ls and ol (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenants because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they
permitted in the residential complex have wilfully or negligently caused undue
damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring
the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the damage. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on April 26, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, DR, and the Tenant OL attended the
hearing.
 
 Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from January 1, 2018 to April 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination.
 
2.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,221.60 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
3.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from January 1,
2018.
 
4.      The
Tenants or an occupant of the rental unit  or a person permitted in the
residential complex by the Tenants have
wilfully or  negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit 
by causing a stove fire resulting in damage to the unit. 
 
5.      The
Landlord has incurred  costs of $1,823.98 to repair the damage and replace
property that was damaged and cannot be reasonably repaired.
 
6.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act relating to the arrears of rent.
 
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act relating to payment for the damage
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before May 15, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $638.82*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to April 30, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $40.15 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting May 1, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May 15,
2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from May 16, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before May 15, 2018, then starting May 16, 2018,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 16, 2018.
 
8.      If,
on or before May 15, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $3,280.09** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after May 16, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
10.   If
the Tenants void the eviction portion of this order as permitted by paragraphs
8 or 9 of this order, then the following provisions will apply.
 
a)    On
or before May 30, 2018 the Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $1,823.98 which
represents the cost of repair or replacement of the damage caused by the
Tenants to the rental unit.
b)    If
the Tenants fail to make the payment in accordance with paragraph 10(a) of this
order the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenants, apply to the Board
pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and
evicting the Tenants.
