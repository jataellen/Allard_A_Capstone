Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: SWL-11631-17
 











 
 

EVW (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict AG (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes (the ‘L1 Application’).
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant has been
persistently late in paying her rent.  The Landlord also claimed compensation
for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date (the
‘L2 Application’).
 
These applications were heard in Stratford
on February 9, 2018.  The Landlord’s Legal
Representative, SL, and the Tenant attended the hearing.  The Tenant spoke with
Duty Counsel prior to the hearing. 
 
Determinations and
Reasons:
The L1 Application 
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the
Tenant was required to pay for the period from December 1, 2017 to February 28,
2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective December 16, 2017.
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
3.     The monthly rent is $800.00.
4.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $800.00
from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
5.     Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenant for the period from September 1, 2016 to December 16, 2017.
6.     The Tenant paid $1,790.00 after the application
was filed.
7.     The parties agree that the amount outstanding to
February 28, 2018, inclusive of rent arrears ($610.00) and costs ($190.00), is
$800.00. 
8.     The parties consent to the termination date set
out in the order below. 
The L2 Application
9.     
The Tenant has persistently
failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.  Specifically, she did not
contest the Landlord’s evidence that since April, 2017, she has only twice paid
the monthly rent in full and on or before the first day of the month when it
was due.  Neither of the two payments made after the Landlord filed the L1
Application reduced the Tenant’s rental account to a zero balance.
10.   As a result, the Landlord’s application for
termination of the tenancy at the end of the term of the tenancy on the basis
of persistent late payment is allowed. 
11.   The Tenant acknowledged that her rental payments
over the past year have been less than ideal.  However, she testified that
during the same period, she was the victim of domestic violence and lost her
employment.  She also has not been receiving child support payments with respect
to her four year old son who resides with her.  She has since obtained
full-time employment as of September 6, 2017.
12.   While the Tenant also acknowledged that she
breached the terms of a prior payment plan under order SWL-03362-17, issued on
July 12, 2017, she explained that she was out of work at the time.  She
testified that she was able to pay the full amount owing on that order shortly
after the breaches.  This appears to have been the case as the present L1
Application relates to arrears from December 1, 2017 forward.  
13.   Despite the Tenant’s fairly chequered history of
rental payments, I find that her substantially improved employment income and
significant good faith payments since the applications were filed suggest that
she is able and willing to comply with the requested “last chance” prompt
payment plan.
14.   I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to the conditions set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
15.   This order contains all of the reasons in this
matter and no further reasons will issue.
It is ordered that:
The L1 Application
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out
below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The
Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before February 27, 2018.
2.     As of the date of this order, the amount of the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the
arrears of rent and compensation the Landlord is entitled to by $554.11*.
3.     However, the Landlord is authorized to offset
the following amounts from the amount the Landlord owes the Tenant:
$26.30 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 17,
2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit, and
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
4.     The Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the
other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February
27, 2018, then starting February 28, 2018, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
6.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord, on or after February 28, 2018.
7.     If, on or before February 27, 2018, the Tenant
pays the amount of $800.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this
order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy would not be
terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this payment is not
made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if she pays the amount
required under that subsection on or after February 28, 2018, but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.  The Tenant is only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
The L2 Application
9.     If the Tenant voids the order for eviction under
the L1 Application pursuant to paragraph 7 of this order, then the following
shall apply:
a.    The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant is denied on
the condition that:
 
i.      The Tenant shall pay the full monthly rent on or before the first
day of each month, commencing March 1, 2018 and for twelve months thereafter up
to February 28, 2019.
  
b.    If the Tenant fails to comply with the conditions set out in
paragraph 9a above, then, within 30 days of the breach, the Landlord may apply
under section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and
evicting the Tenant.  The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of
a breach of a condition set out in paragraph 9a of this order.
