Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-04297-19
 










 
 
 

D.K.
and V.P. (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict A.P. and D.S. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent
that the Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard in Lindsay on November 12, 2019.
 
The Landlords’ representative, E.A., and second-named Tenant attended
the hearing.
 
As a result of a Superior Court of Justice
order suspending the enforcement of LTB eviction orders during the period from
March 19, 2020 to July 31, 2020, the issuance of this Order has been delayed.
Any payments made by the Tenant(s) to the Landlord after the application was
filed by the Landlord must deducted from the amount ordered by the Board.

 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the
period from June 1, 2019 to November 30, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective July 22, 2019.
2.      The
Tenants do not agree with the arrears amount that the Landlord claims but have
no evidence to show the Board to contradict the Landlord’s amounts.  I am
satisfied the Landlord’s amounts are correct due to the lack of evidence to the
contrary.
3.      The
Tenants are trying to find a place to move to and admit they have no way of
paying the arrears.  The second-named Tenant stopped working five months prior
to the hearing and they have a four year old son.
4.      Given
the above, I find there is insufficient evidence to warrant a repayment plan or
a further delay on the termination.  An order with standard terms shall issue.
5.      The
Landlords collected a rent deposit of $980.00 from the Tenants and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
6.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from March 1, 2019
to July 22, 2019.
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before August 15, 2020.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $6,070.00 for arrears of rent to November 30,
2019.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $32.22 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting December 1, 2019 to the date the Tenants move out of
the unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full amount owing on or before August
15, 2020, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from August 16, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before August 15, 2020, then starting August 16,
2020, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after August 16,
2020.
8.      If,
on or before August 15, 2020, the Tenants pay the amount of $14,890.00** to the
Landlords or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after August 16, 2020 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlords. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
10.   Any
payments made by the Tenant to the Landlord after the hearing held on November
12, 2019, shall be deducted from the total amount owing under this order.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order

has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
