Order under Section 21.2
of the 
Statutory Powers
Procedure Act 
and the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 










 

Review Order
 
1OL (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict KD (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes.
 
The Landlord’s application was resolved by order
CEL-68793-17, issued on September 19, 2017.
 
On October 24, 2017, the Tenant requested a review of
that order.
 
The Tenant’s review request was heard in Barrie on
November 27, 2017.
 
The Landlord’s Legal
Representative, EJ, and the Tenant’s Legal Representative, CL from the Office
of the Public Guardian and Trustee (the ‘PGT’) attended the hearing.
 
The Tenant’s common law spouse,
who is an occupant of the rental unit, also attended the hearing. Although the
PGT is not representing him, he agreed with the position of the PGT regarding
termination of the tenancy as set out below.
 
Determinations and Reasons:
 
1.     
The Tenant did not attend
the initial hearing on September 18, 2017.  The PGT, on behalf of the Tenant,
alleges that the Tenant was not reasonably able to participate in the initial hearing
due to the Tenant’s illness and/or incapacity.
2.     
The Tenant was admitted to a
mental health facility in June 2017. The Tenant is still in that facility. The PGT
was appointed as the Tenant’s statutory guardian of property as of October 20,
2017.
3.     
The Landlord does not
dispute that the Tenant was in a mental health facility at the time of the
original hearing.
4.     
Since the Tenant was in a
mental health facility at the time of the original hearing and has been found
to be incapable of managing her own financial affairs, I am satisfied that the
Tenant was not reasonably able to participate in the initial hearing and the
review request is granted.
5.     
The monthly rent is
$1,036.41.
6.     
The Tenant has not paid $2,934.23
of the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from July 1,
2017 to November 30, 2017. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a N4 Notice
of Termination. The rent arrears are not disputed. 
7.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $976.19 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by
the Landlord.
8.     
Interest on the rent deposit,
in the amount of $1.76, is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 19,
2017 to August 31, 2017.
9.     
On behalf of the Tenant, the
PGT requested a final, non-remedial termination of the tenancy as of January
31, 2018. They are currently looking for suitable accommodation for the Tenant
and require the two month delay to organize the Tenant’s move. 
10.  
To address the prejudice to
the Landlord of the increase in the rent owing resulting from the requested delay
to January 31st, the PGT stated that they will make a payment to the
Landlord on or before December 1, 2017 in the amount of $2,078.82 which is just
over two months of rent. One of the months will cover the rent for the month of
December and the second month will be applied to the rent arrears. There is a
last month's rent deposit to be applied to the January 2018 rent.
11.  
In addition, the Tenant’s
common law spouse will be transferring $500.00 to the Tenant’s bank account which
the PGT has access to and that amount will be forwarded to the Landlord by the
PGT once the funds can be accessed in the Tenant’s account.
12.  
The Landlord was opposed to
the requested delay. However, since the payment proposed by the PGT will ensure
that the amount owing to the Landlord does not increase, it would not be unfair
to grant the requested delay to January 31, 2018.
13.  
The legal representatives
were advised at the hearing that the requested delay would be granted if the
proposed payment of $2,078.82 was made. If the payment is not made, the two
month delay will not be granted. The representatives were instructed to submit
a written post hearing submission on or before December 4, 2017 to confirm whether
or not the payment was made.
14.  
A submission was received from
the representatives on December 4, 2017 which confirmed that the $2,078.82 payment
was made. Therefore, the requested delay is granted. 
15.  
The PGT also submitted bank
records to establish that the $500.00 deposit was made to the Tenant’s bank
account and the PGT expects to transfer that amount to the Landlord as soon as
they can access the funds.
16.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until January 31, 2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of
the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Tenant’s review request
is granted. Order CEL-68793-17, issued on September 19, 2017, is cancelled and
replaced by the following: 
2.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before January 31, 2018.
3.     
The payment of
$2,078.82 that was received by the Landlord on or before December 1, 2017 shall
be deducted from the amount ordered below.
4.     
In addition, the
$500.00 payment that the PGT expects to transfer to the Landlord in the next
few days shall also be deducted from the amount ordered when and if
it is received by the Landlord.
5.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $2,117.77*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to December 5, 2017, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
6.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $34.07 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
December 6, 2017 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
7.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
8.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2018, then starting February 1, 2018 the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 1, 2018.
