Tenancies Act, 2006

F L T (S & S) O S (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict T, A T, A H E K A S A
Fl and O E K A S A F E K A S A F (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe (L1 application).
 
Tenants T6 application:
 
The Tenants applied for an order
determining that the Landlord failed to meet the
Landlord’s maintenance obligations under the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act') or failed to comply with health, safety, housing or
maintenance standards.  
 
These applications were heard together in
Toronto on June 6, 2019.
 
The Landlord’s Legal Representative R W Y
and its agents A S (AS), W S, and the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
            L1 Application
 
1.      The Landlords are a charitable organization with a mandate to
provide transitional housing to recent immigrants until they are stable enough
to find suitable alternate accommodation.  
2.      The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit. 
3.      The Landlord alleges that the Tenants have not paid the total rent the
Tenants were required to pay for the period from October 1, 2015 to November
30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective August 21, 2018.
          Lawful rent
4.      The Landlord asserts that the lawful rent is $1,100.00 while the
Tenants argue that the lawful rent should be $800.00 because that is the amount
paid by the previous tenants.  The tenancy agreement sets the rent at $1,200.00
but the Landlords agree that they offered to reduce the rent by $100.00 because
the unit required some work.  
5.      Based on the evidence before me it appears that the Tenants
attempted to unilaterally change the amount of the lawful rent by issuing
cheques to the Landlord for amounts less than the agreed upon rent of $1,100.00.
The fact that the former tenants paid a lower amount of rent is irrelevant. The
lawful rent is whatever the parties agreed to at the beginning of the tenancy
plus any lawful subsequent increases in rent. Therefore, I am satisfied that
the correct lawful rent is $1,100.00.
                        Was
there an agreement to offset labour for rent?
6.      The Tenants have not proven their assertion that a former Board Member
of the Landlord agreed that they could live rent free if they undertook some
work in the rental unit.  Regardless, the Landlords are only seeking rent
arrears for 2015 – 2016 and for part of 2018, meaning the Tenants are
effectively receiving a rent abatement because the Landlords are not claiming
all of the rent owing by the Tenants.
                        Have
the Tenants been given credit from all the payments made
7.      The Landlord claims that the Tenants owe $17,175.00 in rent arrears
for the period ending March 2019. The Tenants assert that they made three cash
payments which the Landlord has not included in its calculations: $1,100.00 on October
18, 2015; $800.00 on November 11, 2018; and $800.00 on October 30, 2016.
8.      The Tenants submitted bank records which indicate that they made
withdrawals around the time of the disputed payments.  
9.      Without reliable evidence of the cash payments, I am unable to find
that any additional amounts were paid. 
10.   I therefore find that the arrears of rent owing are $22,5000.00 to
August 31, 2019.
11.   The Tenants have paid $9,900.00 to the Board in trust since the
application was filed. **
12.   Once the Tenants’ payment into the Board is paid out to Landlord,
the Tenants owe $13,000.00 in rent arrears for the period ending on August 31,
2019.
13.   The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,200.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
14.   Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period
from May 1, 2013 to August 21, 2018.
15.   I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance
with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to
the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and
204(1) of the Act, because the Landlord must bear some responsibility for the
confusion over the rent arrears flowing from the alleged set off arrangement.  
Tenant’s T6 application
16.   The Tenants filed a T6 application alleging that the Landlord
breached its maintenance obligations by failing to maintain the rental unit in manner
fit for habitation. 
17.   Pursuant to section 29(2) of the Act, a T6
application cannot be filed more than one year after the day the alleged
conduct giving rise to the application occurred. Most
of the claims made in the application cannot be considered because they fall
outside of this one-year limitation period, which in this case is September 24,
2017. 
18.   At the hearing the Tenants presented a stack of documentary evidence
more than three inches thick. I directed the Tenants to draw my attention to
those images and documents that they believe are necessary for me to make a
finding on their claims.
19.   While I am satisfied that the Tenants have established that the
rental unit was in need of repair, I am not satisfied that the Tenants has
established that he actually undertook the work claimed or incurred the
expenses claimed.  
20.   The Tenant, OLK  alleged that he spent $18,000.00 to repair the
rental unit because of the following required repairs:
(a)  Exposed
light bulbs in the hall way and through the unit;
(b)  Electrical
issues - hired an electrician to repair the circuit panel;
(c)  Absence
of fire alarms in the rental unit;
(d)  Humidity
and mould;
(e)  The
balcony door could not open;
(f)   Leaky kitchen sink;
(g)  Holes
and leaks in walls and around the windows and drafty windows; and
(h)  Untidy
carpet needing repair;
21.   An examination of the photographs taken by the Landlords in
preparation for hearing, indicates that OLK did not install any of the fixtures
or undertook any of the repairs he is claiming a refund for. It was also
evident through cross-examination that the Tenant had not used many of the
items he purportedly purchased in the rental unit.
22.   The Tenant’s evidence though copious does not allow me to conclude
that they are entitled to receive a refund for the amounts claimed. The Tenant’s
evidence in support of his out of pocket expenses is not reliable given the
cross examination and he did not adequately refute the suggestion that many of
the receipts were for items not used for the rental unit.
23.   The Tenants have alleged that they stopped paying rent because they
made an agreement with the Landlord to repair the unit in lieu of rent. The
Tenant initially said that he made repairs worth an entire year’s rent,
however, he later indicated that the unit is still in need of significant
repairs.  This was also confirmed by the Tenant’s own home inspection report
which they obtained on December 11, 2018. The report indicates that the unit is
in need of extensive upgrades, maintenance and repairs such as:
i)            
External masonry weakness;
ii)           
Porch slope and handrails;
iii)          
Trees and shrubs are too close to the building;
iv)          
Windows have cracked glazing and frames are old;
v)           
Mold observed on the ceiling and under kitchen cabinets;
vi)          
Kitchen exhaust fans were missing; and
vii)        
Bathroom exhaust fan missing.
24.   The OLK also claimed $9,000.00 for out of pocket expenses for meals,
laundry etc. which he said the Tenants incurred because of the problems he
noted in the kitchen.  
25.   It is alleged OLK meal receipts should not be accepted because they are
inflated to mislead the Board.  Mr. S testified using the OLK’s own disclosure
that the OLK claimed meal expenses from Ziggys on January 8, 2019, and three
separate purchases were made within 30 minutes using three separate debit
cards.  
26.   It was also suggested using the Tenants’ evidence that the many of
meal expenses were for more than 1 guest, even though the OLK lives alone.
27.   Despite repeated prompts from me it was difficult to ascertain when
the events which gave rise to the claims actually occurred.  Given that the
Landlord established that it is more likely than not that OLK has claimed
expenses for items which were not actually used in the rental unit, I draw an
adverse inference with respect to the Tenants’ claims and am not prepared to
award any refund except as indicated below.
                        Landlord’s evidence
28.   The Landlord testified that the Tenants did not follow proper
procedures when making repair or maintenance requests. The Tenants made their
complaints to Mr. S who all parties agree may be suffering from early dementia.
Put simply, the Landlord’s position is that the Tenant opted to raise issues
with Mr. S in order to exploit his vulnerability.
29.   AS testified that once the Board discovered that the Tenant had not
paid rent in sometime and they received the Tenant’s T6 application, he then inspected
the rental unit on or about November 10, 2018.  Based on that inspection, he
then served another notice of entry on November 12, 2018 and made the following
repairs on that day:
i)            
Replaced broken glass in three windows with
glass orders from Remington Glass;
ii)           
Replaced Aluminum storm sash for the window - verified
that the window goes up and down but given the age of windows, they do not stay
open properly;
iii)          
Fixed the rear door of the kitchen and replaced
the door knob;
iv)          
Replaced the sweeping threshold to the kitchen
door and weather stripping;
v)           
Replaced the storm window glass with plexiglass;
vi)          
Tightened the faucet that was leaky;
vii)        
Fixed the shower head fixture;
viii)       
Changed the toilet seat flap that was loose; and
ix)          
Fixed a door frame that was loose.
30.   AS also went back to the unit on February 26, 2019 after the Landlord
received the professional inspection report.
31.   The Landlord testified that they have repaired most to the items
that needed repair in the unit.  They submit remaining items are mostly
cosmetic and do not interfere with OLK’s use of the unit or they are repairs
which are not necessary for the rental unit to be habitable, and there is no
legal requirement to modernize a rental unit.
Findings on the T6 claims:
32.   Without a doubt the rental unit needed significant repairs.  The
Landlord concedes this.
33.   However, the building is over 100 years old and is habitable by
those standards. The defects noted in the Tenants’ home inspection report would
be of concern if the building were a newer build because building code
requirements have changed. In buildings as old as the residential complex, the wiring
and other elements are grandfathered and would only require compliance with the
building code if updated.  
34.   The Tenants acknowledged this in their own submission that when they
hired someone to look at the bathroom. This contractor mentioned that if he
undertook the work requested, it would result in a cascade of mandatory
upgrades and he was not prepared to do the work unless the legal owners
requested it.
35.   For this reason, while I am satisfied that the Tenants have met the
evidentiary burden required to establish the rental unit was in need of repair,
I am also satisfied that the Landlord responded appropriately in addressing the
issues once they were brought to the Board’s attention. Further, any abatement
of rent the Tenants would have been entitled to has been received by virtue of
the fact that Landlord has not claimed the rent arrears owing for year 2017.  Therefore,
I am not granting the Tenants’ a remedy for their T6 application.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenants is denied on
the condition that the  Tenants pay to the Landlord $11,175.00, which represents the arrears of rent outstanding for the period
ending August
31, 2019 less the $2,500.00 credited back to the Tenants
+ the application filing fee.

and evicting the Tenants, and for the payment of any new arrears of rent and
NSF charges not already ordered under paragraph 1 of this order. The Landlord
must make the application within 30 days of a breach of a condition set out in
paragraphs 2 or 4 of this order.
