Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: SWL-11020-17
A.K.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict L.B. and
C.B. (the 'Tenants') because they, another occupant of the rental unit or
someone they permitted in the residential complex have substantially interfered
with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlord or another tenant; and because they have been persistently late in
paying their rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date (the ‘L2 application’).
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants because the Tenants did not pay the
rent that the Tenants owe (the ‘L1 application’).  These applications were
heard together.  The application is amended to remove Carl Brennan as a Tenant
as this individual was not in possession of the rental unit at the date the
applications were filed.  
 
The applications were heard in London on
January 23, 2018.  The Landlord attended the hearing.  The Tenant also attended
the hearing.  The Tenant spoke with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing. The
Tenant’s support person, R.W, also attended the hearing. 
 
There was no factual dispute between the
parties.  The amount of arrears were agreed upon as was the disposition with
respect to the L2 application in its entirety.  The only issue before the Board
was whether to accept the Landlord’s proposal that the arrears be ordered
payable by February 28, 2018, or to accept the Tenant’s proposal that she be
given until March 31, 2018 to make payment of the arrears.  Both parties agreed
that the rent between the date of the hearing and the date the arrears came due
must be paid in full and on time.  I accepted the Tenant’s proposal for the
reasons that follow.  All my reasons are contained in this Order.  No further
reasons will be issued.  The parties agreed statement of facts is signed and
included in the Board’s file
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The parties agreed to
resolve the issues raised in the L2 application by applying conditions which
are outlined in detail in the order below.  Specifically, the Tenant is to pay
the hot water bill by the due date on the bill once the bill is provided to the
Tenant by the Landlord.  
2.     
The parties agreed that the
hot water bill is paid up to date on the hearing date.
3.     
Additionally, the parties
agreed that the Tenant has returned the money paid to her to purchase a washing
machine.  This issue is resolved.  
4.     
The parties agree that the
Tenant did not pay the total rent required for the period from November 1, 2017
to January 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective November 25, 2017.
5.     
The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
6.     
The monthly rent is $1,800.00.
7.     
The Tenant has made no payments since the
application was filed. 
8.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,800.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
9.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 5, 2017 to November 25, 2017.
10.   The parties agree that the amount outstanding to
January 31, 2018, inclusive of rent arrears ($5,400.00), and costs ($190.00),
is $5,590.00. 
11.   The Tenant testified that she was recently the
victim of crime and is awaiting a significant settlement from another
proceeding which is concluded.  This was confirmed by her support person who
also noted that the Tenant will likely have access to funding from a local
charitable organization in short order.  
12.   However, the Tenant noted that she is unsure
when the funds will be made available to her and requested until March 31, 2018
in light of her recently experienced trauma, and the supports in place, to pay
the arrears in full.  The Tenant agreed to pay the rent in full and on time in
February 2018 and March 2018 in any event.  
13.   The Landlord argued that he is carrying costs
related to the property and is the only income earner in his family.  The
Landlord states that he is stressed and worries for his heart if the Tenant
does not pay by February 28, 2018.  I was not presented with any medical
evidence suggesting the presence of a heart condition or corroborating that a
delay of one month in collecting the arrears would significantly exacerbate
such a condition.  I appreciate that the Landlord is carrying debt as a result
of the Tenant’s arrears.  
14.   However, I fail to see a significant distinction
in allowing termination of the tenancy at the end of February as opposed to the
end of March.  The Tenant has already agreed to pay the rent as it comes due on
the first so that the arrears will not increase, this is subject to an order
under section 78 of the Act which will result in termination of the
tenancy if the Tenant fails to make such payment.  
15.   I find on a balance of probabilities that the
Landlord did not provide evidence that the existence of the arrears for a
period of one month more than the Landlord requested will result in any
material change or significant prejudice to the Landlord.   
16.   I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
On consent of the parties, it is ordered
that:
 
1.      The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,590.00, which represents the
arrears of rent ($5,400.00), and costs ($190.00) outstanding for the period
ending January 31, 2018.
2.      The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant is denied on
the condition that:
(a)  The
Tenant makes the following payments to the Landlord in respect of the monies
owing under paragraph 1 of this order:



Date Payment Due


Amount of Payment




March 31, 2018


$5,590.00
(costs
  and arrears)



 
AND
(b)  The
Tenant pays the Landlord the rent for the months of February 2018 and March
2018 in full, and on the first of each corresponding month.  
AND
(c)  The
Tenant pays the hot water bill by the due date on the bill.
3.      If the Tenant fails to make any of the payments in accordance with
paragraph 2, and by the dates required, then:
(a)      The Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenant, and for the payment of any new arrears of rent and NSF
charges not already ordered under paragraph 1 of this order. The Landlord must
make the application within 30 days of a breach of a condition set out in
paragraph 2 of this order. 
(b)      The balance owing under paragraph 1 of this order shall become
payable on the day following the date of default. The monies owing shall bear
interest at the post-judgment interest rate determined under subsection 207(7)
of the Act.
