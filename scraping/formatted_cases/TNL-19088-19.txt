Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-19088-19
 











 
 
 

HH and Numbered Company CC (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict MB and JB (the 'Tenants')
because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
The Landlords also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenants because the Landlord requires possession of
the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlords also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on December 13,
2019.
 
Only the Landlord’s agent, HH,
attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
L2 Application
1.     
The Landlord’s agent, (HH),
submitted documentary evidence that proves that the rental unit is owned by the
Landlord numbered company.
 
2.     
Subsection 48(5) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) provides that a Landlord may not evict a
tenant for the Landlord’s own residential use of the rental unit unless the
rental unit is owned in whole or in part by an individual, and the Landlord is
an individual.
 
3.     
The rental unit is not owned
in whole or in part by an individual.  Consequently, HH is not entitled to
evict the Tenants in order to take possession of the rental unit for the
purpose of residential occupation.
 
4.     
Consequently, the Landlord’s
L2 application will be dismissed.
 
L1 application:
 
5.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from July 1,
2019 to December 31, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a
Notice of Termination.
 
6.     
The Landlords collected a
rent deposit of $1,000.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlords.
 
7.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from May 9, 2019 to December 31, 2019.
 
8.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
1.     
Unless the Tenants void the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before January
27, 2020.
 
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlords $5,314.40*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 16, 2020, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlords $32.88 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting January 17, 2020 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before January 27, 2020, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
January 28, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 27, 2020, then starting January 28, 2020, the Landlords
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlords, on or after January 28, 2020.
 
8.     
If, on or before January 27,
2020, the Tenants pay the amount of $6,990.00** to the Landlords or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after January 28,
2020 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlords.

In accordance with section 81 of
