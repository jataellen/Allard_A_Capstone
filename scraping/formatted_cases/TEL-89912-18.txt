Landlord’s L1 application.
M. L. (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict J. L., N. M. and B. V.
(the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
Landlord’s L2 application.
M. L. (the 'Landlord') also
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict J. L., N. M. and B. V.
(the 'Tenants') because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone
they permitted in the residential complex have wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the damage.
 
These applications were heard
in Peterborough on May 17, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
With respect to the
Landlord’s L1 application, the
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from March 1, 2018 to May 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective March 20, 2018.
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,700.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from February 5, 2018 to March 20, 2018.
4.     
The Tenants paid $566.67
after the application was filed.
5.     
With respect to the
Landlord’s L2 application, on
February 5, 2018 there was an agreement reached between the parties that the
Tenants would reimburse the Landlord $1,274.10 for several broken windows that
the Tenants or their friend had caused to be broken.
6.     
This payment has never been
made and as a result the Landlord served an n5 notice to the Tenants on March
2, 2018 for which the payment has still not been made.
7.     
The Landlord provided copies
of the agreement accepting responsibility and also a copy of the invoice for
the work done.
8.     
The Tenants have had more
than sufficient time to pay for their damage and have chosen not to do so.
9.     
Therefore , the Tenants or a
person permitted in the residential complex by the Tenants have wilfully or  negligently caused undue damage to
the rental unit or residential complex.
10.  
The Tenants did not correct
the problem within the time period set out in the Notice of Termination.
11.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the
rental unit on or before May 29, 2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $1,012.29*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to May 18, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $55.89 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
May 19, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $1,274.10, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage.
6.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May 29, 2018, the Tenants will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from May 30,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
7.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before May 29, 2018, then starting May 30, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
8.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 30, 2018.
