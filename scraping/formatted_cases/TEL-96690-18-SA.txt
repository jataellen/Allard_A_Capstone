Order
under Section 78(11)
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: TEL-96690-18-SA
 











 
 
 

B. W. C. F. (the 'Landlord') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict T. M. and R. R. (the 'Tenants') and
for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent and compensation they owe because
they failed to meet a condition specified in order TEL-93876-18 issued on
November 6, 2018.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved by
order TEL-96690-18, issued on November 26, 2018. The Tenants filed a motion to
set aside order TEL-96690-18.
 
This motion was heard in Toronto on
December 11, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the
first-named Tenant above (the ‘Tenant’) attended the hearing. The Landlord was
represented by D. C..
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
On a motion to set aside under s. 78(11) the
first issue the Board must decide is whether or not the Tenants breached the
original order as alleged by the Landlord in its application. 
2.     
Here, there is no dispute between the parties.
The first payment due under the repayment plan was $500.00 towards the arrears
plus the monthly rent for November. Both were supposed to be paid by November
15, 2018. The Tenants paid the monthly rent on November 5, 2018 but did not pay
the $500.00 towards the arrears until November 16, 2018. It was one day late.
So I am satisfied the Tenants breached the original order as alleged by the
Landlord. 
3.     
The second question the Board must answer is
whether or not it would be unfair in all of the circumstances to set aside the
eviction order. 
4.     
This tenancy is a fairly new tenancy. The
Tenants have only lived there for ten months. The second named Tenant above has
apparently moved out. But the Tenants’ 10 year old son still lives in the
rental unit with his father.
5.     
When the parties originally came before the
Board with respect to the Landlord’s application for an eviction order for
non-payment of rent, the Tenant asked the Board for relief from eviction in the
form of a repayment plan. The Landlord opposed that request, but the Board
granted the Tenant the relief he asked for. The order says in part:
6.  I have
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). The Tenant has
lived in the rental unit since April 2018, with his 10 year old son who has a
respiratory condition. The Tenant says that he was working as an independent
contractor when he moved into the rental unit. However, the customer he was
working for refused to pay him thousands of dollars for his work and insisted
that the Tenant take her to court to recover those funds. In support of his
testimony, the Tenant showed the Board a text message on his phone in which he
sent an invoice to the customer and she responds “see you in court”. 
7.  The Tenant
says he then spent several weeks trying to find more stable work and was able
to find employment in a unionized construction position. The Tenant says he is
now working for an hourly wage and his employment is stable. In support of his
position, the Tenant showed the Board a copy of a paystub on his phone which
indicates that he is working a unionized job and making a steady income. 
8.  The Tenant
is seeking relief in the form of a payment plan. Based on the Tenant’s current
monthly income and expenses, I am satisfied that he can afford to make payments
towards a payment plan and pay his rent in full and on time, subject to the
Landlord’s right to file an application to terminate the tenancy in the event
of a breach. For these reasons, I find that it would not be unfair to grant
relief from eviction subject to  the conditions set out in this order pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
6.     
The repayment plan the Board
ordered was proposed by the Tenant.
7.     
The Tenant says he missed
the deadline by one day because he did not realise November 15, 2018 was a
Thursday. He gets paid every Friday. 
8.     
But the Tenant also did not
pay December’s rent on time as required by the order. 
9.     
The Tenant says he failed to
pay December’s rent on time because he received his paycheque late. As I understand
it, the Tenant is sent to various job sites and his paycheque is available for
pick up at a site where he was not working that week. When he did not pick up
his paycheque it was mailed to him. 
10.   But the Tenant also says that a month ago he got
a second job doing renovations in the evenings. The Tenant says that this
second job has allowed him to get back on track. As I pointed out at the
hearing, that statement does not actually appear to be true as the Tenant
failed to pay December’s rent on time which was due after he got this second
job working evenings. The Tenant says he had other bills to take care of. 
11.   The monthly rent here is $1,233.00. The Tenant
presented no evidence as to how much he actually makes or what his other
monthly expenses are. 
12.   Neither party produced any corroborating
documentation. 
13.   In response to my question, the Tenant
acknowledged that he has a history of late and non-payment that has led to
applications before the Board with respect to his prior tenancy. The Board’s
records indicate that between 2011 and 2017 there were 14 applications to the
Board with respect to the Tenants’ previous tenancy for non-payment of rent,
persistent late payment, and because the Tenants breached consent orders or
mediated agreements. Somewhat surprisingly, this Landlord was also the Landlord
with respect to that previous tenancy. 
14.   So the question for the Board is whether or not
it would be unfair in all of the circumstances to permit the tenancy to
continue. 
15.   The problem with the Tenants’ motion is that the
evidence indicates that the Tenant is either unable or unwilling to meet his
financial obligation to the Landlord to pay rent on time and in full. It is
unclear from the Tenant’s evidence if that is because his income is
insufficient to meet his expenses, or if it is because he spends his money on
other things, or if it is because he cannot manage his finances to ensure he
has the funds he needs to make payment when it is due. But there is nothing in
the evidence before the Board that suggests the Tenant is able to comply with
his own repayment plan. . It seems inevitable that permitting the tenancy to
continue would simply result in additional legal proceedings in the future. 
16.   Given all of the above, I am not satisfied that
it would not be unfair to grant the Tenant’s motion. As a result, the motion
must be denied. 
17.   So the final issue before the Board is with
respect to the timing of the lifting of the stay. The Tenant says it will take
him two months to find a new place and move but he has not yet started looking.
The Landlord is willing to delay the lifting of the stay until December 31,
2018 due to the holiday season. 
18.   Given that the arrears of rent now stand at
$4,431.00 delaying the eviction for an additional two months would be unduly
prejudicial to the Landlord. It seems to me that the reasonable thing to do
would be to lift the stay effective January 7, 2019. That would give the Tenant
sufficient time to figure out what he is going to do without unduly prejudicing
the Landlord’s interests. 
19.   This order contains all of the reasons for the
decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.


It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The motion to set aside
Order TEL-96690-18, issued on November 26, 2018, is denied.
2.     
The stay of order
TEL-96690-18 is lifted effective January 7, 2019.
