Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-76751-17
 










 
 
 

M.L.M.I.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict R.S.
and T.C. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on March 1, 2017.
 
The Landlord and the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Only the Landlord’s representative, M.F., attended the hearing.  The
second-named Tenant’s brother, S.C. attended the hearing; however, did not have
written authorization from either Tenant to represent them at the hearing.
 
Preliminary Issue:
 
1.     The
second-named Tenant’s brother stated he was attending the hearing on behalf of
the Tenants to get an adjournment of the application; however, he had no
supporting authorization from either Tenant confirming this information. 
2.     He
further stated the Tenants had to leave the night before to go out of province
because the second-named Tenant and her brother’s mother passed away.  He did
not provide any confirmation for this claim.
3.     The
second-named Tenant’s brother was notified he could not represent the Tenants
but he could remain in the hearing room to hear the outcome of their
application.  
4.     The
Landlord had not been notified the Tenants would not be in attendance.
5.     The
hearing went forward and the second-named Tenant’s brother remained in the
hearing room until the application was heard in its entirety and heard result
of the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from December 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective December 26, 2016.
2.     The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,202.58 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
3.     Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2017
to December 26, 2016.
4.     I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before April 2, 2017.
2.     The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $3,202.52*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to March 22, 2017, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $39.54 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting March 23, 2017 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $170.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.     If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before April
2, 2017, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from April 3, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 2, 2017, then starting April 3,
2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 3, 2017.
8.     If
the Tenants wish to void this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)       $4,956.69 if the payment is made on or before March 31, 2017, or
ii)      $6,159.27 if the payment is made on or before April 2, 2017**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after April 3, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
