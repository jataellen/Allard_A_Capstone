Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-06652-19











 
 

D.C. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict K.P. and K. P. (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Belleville on February
6, 2020.
 
The Landlord’s agent, N.C., and
the Tenants attended the hearing. The Tenants were represented by S.H. acting
as Tenant Duty Counsel. 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
There is no dispute between
the parties that the Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were
required to pay for the period from August 1, 2019 to February 29, 2020. 
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
November 8, 2019.
2.     
The lawful monthly rent is
$789.94. No payments were made to the Landlord after the application was filed.
3.     
The parties agree that as of
the date of hearing before the Board the arrears of rent owing for the period
ending February 29, 2020 total $4,829.46.
4.     
The Landlord incurred costs
of $175.00 for filing the application and is entitled to reimbursement of those
costs. So the total amount owing to the Landlord as of the date of hearing for
the period ending February 29, 2020 totals $5,000.46.
5.     
The Tenants request relief
in the form of a repayment plan. They ask that they be permitted to pay $600.00
a month towards the rent arrears, pay rent on time, and make a lump sum payment
in short order of $2,500.00. The Landlord opposes that request and seeks a
standard order but is not averse to extending the termination date to March 31,
2020.
6.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to the conditions proposed by the Tenants. I
say this for the following reasons.
7.     
The Tenants say the
second-named Tenant above has been losing his sight for a number of years and
is supposed to have eye surgery but the reason they have fallen further behind
then before is that he has also developed a cardiac issue. The week before the
hearing he had his second heart attack. The family has been travelling back and
forth to another community to receive care and were unaware that there is some funding
available for medically necessary travel through the Ontario Disability Support
Program (‘ODSP’). The first-named Tenant has cut back on work to assist him.
Heart surgery has been postponed because the Tenants face the threat of
homelessness. 
8.     
The Tenants provided
testimony with respect to their income and expenses. That indicates they can
afford the payment plan proposed. But based on their evidence they should not
have fallen behind to the degree they have. They freely agree with that
assessment. They cannot explain exactly what has happened to all of their
income, it is a mystery, so they have arranged for budget counselling through
ODSP. 
9.     
They have also reached out
to the Community Homelessness Prevention Initiative (‘CHPI’) to apply for
assistance. They have been told that if the Board grants a repayment plan CHPI
will contribute towards the repayment of the rent arrears in the amount of
$2,500.00 paid directly to the Landlord. 
10.  
The Tenants have fallen
behind in the rent before. But the Board’s records show that prior to this
application there was only one previous application for non-payment of rent (in
Board file TEL-52064-14) and that was withdrawn through mediation. 
11.  
The Landlord showed me a
payment history during the hearing which I read into the record. Essentially
the Tenants make sporadic payments, fall behind, then pay extra. But nothing at
all has been paid since the application was filed on November 14, 2019.
12.  
The Landlord says previous
N4s have been served, informal repayment agreements have been made and
breached, and the Tenants have not had a zero balance owing since February of
2019. Essentially the Landlord has not pursued the arrears aggressively. The
Landlord is aware of the second-named Tenant’s health issues.
13.  
Given all of the above, I
agree with the Tenants’ representative. The balance of fairness suggests the
Tenants should be given an opportunity to save the tenancy. It would not be
unfair in all of the circumstances here to grant the relief requested. The
Tenants have mostly paid off rent arrears before without the necessity of Board
intervention, they have a realistic and not particularly long repayment plan, being
evicted at this point would be a greater than usual hardship because of the second-named
Tenant’s health issues and need for surgery, and the repayment plan would put a
fairly large sum in the Landlord’s hands fairly quickly. 
14.  
So an order shall issue
granting relief as requested. 
15.  
This order contains all of
the reasons for the decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.
It is ordered that:
1.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $5,004.46 for arrears of rent up to February 29, 2020 and costs.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord the amount set out in paragraph 1 in accordance with the following
schedule:
1)   
$2,500.00 on or before March
7, 2020;
2)   
$600.00 on or before March
31, 2020;
3)   
$600.00 on or before April
30, 2020;
4)   
$600.00 on or before May 31,
2020;
5)   
$600.00 on or before June
30, 2020; and 
6)   
$104.46 on or before July
31, 2020. 
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord new rent on time and in full for the period March 1, 2020 to
July 31, 2020. 
4.     
If the Tenants fail to make
any one of the payments in accordance with this order, the outstanding balance
of any arrears of rent and costs to be paid by the Tenants to the Landlord
pursuant to paragraph 1 of this order shall become immediately due and owing
and the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenants, apply to the Board within
30 days** of the Tenants’ breach pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order
terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants and requiring that the Tenants
pay any new arrears, NSF fees and related charges that became owing after
February 29, 2020.
