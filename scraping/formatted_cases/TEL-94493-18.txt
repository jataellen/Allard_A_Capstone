M.C. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict R.C. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did
not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on
October 31, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the
Tenant attended the hearing. The Landlord was represented by S.K..

 
Determinations:
 
1.     
Although the Tenant does not
dispute he has not paid the total rent he was required to pay for the period
from August 1, 2018 to October 31, 2018, he does question the amount owing. He
says he believes he made a payment in September that the Landlord has not
credited him for. However, the Tenant cannot produce any evidence in support of
that belief so I am satisfied that the payment history presented by the
Landlord is more likely than not accurate.  
2.     
Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 24, 2018.
3.     
The Tenant paid $1,488.34 after
the application was filed.
4.     
The arrears of rent owing as
of the date of the hearing for the period ending October 31, 2018 total
$1,094.17.
5.     
The Landlord incurred costs
of $190.00 for filing the application and is entitled to reimbursement of those
costs.
6.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,089.32 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
7.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from August 1, 2018 to August 24, 2018
totalling $1.29.
8.     
The only real dispute
between the parties is the Tenant’s request for relief in the form a repayment
plan. The Tenant proposes a repayment plan whereby the arrears and costs would
be paid by December 5, 2018. 
9.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until December 5, 2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of
the Act. I say this for the following reasons. 
10.   The Tenant says he has lived in the rental unit
since August of 2012. He lives there with his 18 year old daughter. In July and
again in August of 2018 he had deaths in his family and travelled to the United
States as a result. That is the primary cause for the Tenant being in rent
arrears and needing time to pay. 
11.   The Landlord opposes the Tenant’s request
because of the extensive history before the Board of prior applications
involving this tenancy. The Board’s records indicate there have been at least
seven prior applications for non-payment of rent as well as an application
about a breached repayment plan. With respect to the latter of these the
Board’s order warns the Tenant he is being given a “last chance” to put the
Tenant’s financial house in order. 
12.   I understand where the Landlord is coming from.
At some point in time a tenant’s history of failing to meet his or her
obligations is so extensive that further relief becomes unfair to the landlord.
Essentially a point is reached where enough is enough. 
13.   That being said, I would note that the Act does
not permit the Board to say enough is enough on applications such as these.
Pursuant to s. 74(3) of the Act the Board is mandatorily required to insert a
clause in its order that gives the Tenant time to pay off the rent arrears and
filing fee to save his tenancy. 
14.   Given the unavoidable passage of time between
the hearing of this application and the writing of this order, the Tenant’s
proposed repayment plan is only three additional days’ worth of delay. Given that
I have no reason to doubt the Tenant’s evidence as to how the arrears occurred,
it seems to me that under these circumstances giving the Tenant until December
5, 2018 to clear the rent arrears and costs would not be unfair to the
Landlord. A standard voidable eviction order shall issue giving the Tenant
until December 5, 2018 to clear the debt owing. 
15.   This order contains all of the reasons for the
decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.


It is ordered that:
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before December
5, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $785.73* (less any payments made to the Landlord after the hearing
before the Board on October 31, 2018), which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to November 21, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $35.97 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
November 22, 2018 to the date he moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before December 2, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
December 3, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before December 5, 2018, then starting December 6, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after December 6, 2018.
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, he must pay to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust:
i)        $2,378.34 (less any payments made to the Landlord after the hearing
before the Board on October 31, 2018) if the payment is made on or before
November 30, 2018, or
ii)       $3,472.51 (less any payments made to the Landlord after the hearing
before the Board on October 31, 2018) if the payment is made on or before
December 5, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after December 6, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
