Order under Sections 35,
87(1) and 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 











 
 

LB or the Landlord applied for an order requiring YR
or the Tenant to pay the rent that the Tenant owes. (L9 Application)
 
The Landlord also applied for an order determining
whether the Tenant altered the locking system without the Landlord's consent.
(L8 Application)
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because  the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex:   a.) has
wilfully caused undue damage to the premises; b.) has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord in a residential complex that has three
or fewer residential units because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental
unit or a person the Tenant permitted in the residential complex; and c.) has
seriously impaired the safety of another person.  The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination
date. (L2 Application)
 
These applications were heard in Mississauga on
February 5, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Landlord’s
Legal Representative, RG, attended the hearing.  After RG submitted that the
Tenant was aware of today’s hearing, the hearing commenced on an uncontested
basis at 10:25 am.  
 
Determinations:
 
L9 Application
 
1.     
The Tenant was in possession
of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
2.     
The Landlord lives in a
separate unit above the Tenant in the same building.
3.     
The Tenant did not pay the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from October 1, 2017
to January 31, 2018.  
4.     
The Landlord confirmed that
there is no last month’s rent deposit being held by him.
5.     
The Landlord submitted an L9
update sheet to affirm the total rent owing up to February 28, 2018, which
accounted for another month of rent coming due and not paid, and also confirmed
the Tenant made no payment to the Landlord after the filing of the application.
L8 Application
6.     
The Landlord testified that
in October 2017, the Landlord went to collect that month’s rent from the Tenant
and an argument ensued.  From that, the Landlord testified the Tenant changed
the locks and when the Landlord discovered this and asked for new keys, the
Tenant refused to give the Landlord a copy of the new keys.
7.     
The Landlord testified that
whenever the Landlord gives notice to enter, he is met consistently with the
Tenant’s refusal to allow him entry.
8.     
Based on the uncontested
submission of the Landlord, I find the Tenant altered the locking system on a
door giving entry to the rental unit without the Landlord's consent, and pursuant
to subsection 35(3) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’),
I am granting the Landlord’s request to order that the
Tenant provide the Landlord with new, working keys.
L2 Application
9.     
RG submitted exhibit LL#2,
which is a copy of the 2-year lease commencing on June 1, 2017 between the
Landlord and the original tenants, the Tenant and his spouse, LR.  RG submitted
that the Tenant and LR also had a 7-year old son living with them, but in July
2017, LR and their son left the rental unit to live elsewhere.  RG stated that
another co-occupant moved into the unit, a CS, around the end of October, early
November 2017.  RG stated that CS vacated the rental unit on or about January
6, 2018, leaving the Tenant alone in the unit.
10.  
The Landlord submitted
exhibit LL#1, which comprises 7 pages of photographs to evidence:  (pg 1) a
basement window of the unit that is left open all the time; (pg 2) CS being
assaulted by the Tenant; (pg 3) a lighter and pestle belonging to the Tenant
for grinding and lighting up weed/marijuana; (pg 4) LR’s personal items thrown
outside the unit by the Tenant; (pg 5) the garage filled with the Tenant’s
belongings, and showing a broken cable for the opening mechanism; (vi) the
Tenant’s car that is parked at another property in the complex; and (pg 6) the
Landlord’s receipt from the Peel Regional Police to evidence a report request
for an incident involving the Tenant threatening the Landlord’s wife.
Serious impairment of another person’s safety
11.  
In late December 2017, the
Landlord testified that CS complained to him about the Tenant eating CS’ food
and using CS’ personal items such as toothpaste.  The Landlord testified he
went to visit CS in the rental unit, and they talked for about 15 minutes when
the Tenant entered the unit and confronted CS.  The Landlord testified that CS
and the Tenant started to argue when the Tenant punched CS, felling CS into the
couch (page 2 of LL#1) and causing CS to cover up with the Tenant leaning over
CS in a threatening manner.  The Landlord confirmed he saw this first-hand and
was quick enough to shoot a video to evidence this.  He played the video
sequence for the Member, and affirmed that the photo in LL#1 was taken from
that video.
12.  
Based on this uncontested
testimony and evidence of the Landlord, I find the Tenant has impaired the
safety of another person while in the rental unit.
 
Substantial Interference
13.  
On January 3, 2018, the
Landlord testified that when his wife went to the Tenant to collect that
month’s rent, the Tenant threatened the Landlord’s wife.  The Landlord
confirmed he was not there and could only relay what his wife had told him.
14.  
The Landlord testified his
wife and two children went downstairs to ask for the rent, when the Tenant
started to yell at the wife, threatening that he “was going to kill” her.  The
Landlord stated his wife and children left immediately to go upstairs into the
Landlord’s unit, locked the door and his wife called 911 for help.  The
Landlord stated that page 6 of LL#1 is the evidence of the report they
requested of the police about the incident, which has not yet arrived.
15.  
The Landlord testified that
his family is now afraid to encounter the Tenant.
16.  
The Landlord testified that
he has tried to enter the unit with proper notice but the Tenant has refused
him entry every time.  The Landlord described one such situation by submitting
exhibit LL#4, which is a copy of the ESA’s December 18, 2017 Order, requiring
the Landlord to correct certain electrical deficiencies in the house, which
affects the rental unit as well as the Landlord’s unit above.  
17.  
RG submitted the Landlord’s
February 2, 2018 notice to the Tenant, that he would require access to the unit
on February 3, 2018 (exhibit LL#5).  RG also submitted exhibit LL#6 which is a
copy of the Tenant’s response, refusing the Landlord entry.
18.  
RG submitted another earlier
response from the Tenant dated January 26, 2018 (exhibit LL#6) when the Tenant
refused the Landlord entry due to the Tenant’s “very hectic work schedule”.  As
the Landlord does not possess a working key to the unit, the Landlord was
unable to enter the unit at that time. 
19.  
Based on the uncontested
testimony and evidence of the Landlord, I find that on a balance of
probabilities, the Tenant’s conduct has substantially interfered with the
Landlord's, and the Landlord’s family’s, reasonable enjoyment of the
residential complex and with a lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlord.
Wilful damage
20.  
The Landlord testified that
the Tenant has no right to use the garage but physically lifted the door
without properly using the remote keypad.  The Landlord affirmed the Tenant
therefore damaged the opening mechanism to the door, which is evidenced on page
5 of LL#1.
21.  
The Landlord confirmed that
he did not witness the Tenant attempting to enter the garage, so was unable to
provide first-hand testimony that it was the Tenant who damaged the garage door. 
Even if it were the Tenant who damaged the garage door as the Landlord claimed,
there is no evidence to persuade me that the damage was done wilfully.  As
such, this claim of the Landlord must be denied.
22.  
In any event, based on the
two findings above with regard to serious impairment and substantial
interference, I am prepared to grant the Landlord’s requested remedy of
termination.  
23.  
Due to the impact the
Tenant’s threat has on the Landlord’s family, GR requested that when
termination of the tenancy is ordered, that the enforcement (should it be
required) be provisioned so that the Sheriff may act expeditiously.
24.  
It is noted that GR and the
Landlord had begun to present on other claims under the L2 application but
relented on pressing those claims once the aforementioned findings were made by
me orally during the hearing.
Section 83 Circumstances
25.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
L9 Application
 
1.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $6,000.00*, which represents the amount of rent owing up to February
28, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00* for the cost of filing the application.
3.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 26, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
February 27, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
L8 Application
4.     
The Tenant shall immediately
provide the Landlord with a working key (or keys if there is more than one
lock) to the door of the rental unit.
L2 Application
5.     
The tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated in a final (non-remedial) way, as of February 28,
2018. 
6.     
The Tenant must move out of
the rental unit on or before February 28, 2018.
7.     
If the Tenant fails to move
out of the rental unit on or before February 28, 2018, the Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $39.45** per day for compensation for the use of the unit from
March 1, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
8.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 28, 2018, then starting March 1, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after March 1, 2018. The Sheriff is requested to
expedite the enforcement of this order.
