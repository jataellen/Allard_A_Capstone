Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-90414-18
 










 
 

B.
A. M. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
D. T. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes and because he has been persistently late in paying his rent.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on May 8, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing. The Landlord was
represented by S. C..
 
Determinations:
 
1.      Mid-way
through the hearing of the evidence with respect to this application the Tenant
asked for an adjournment. It appears that the Tenant consulted with Tenant Duty
Counsel prior to the hearing and was advised to seek adjournment. The request
was denied because the Tenant was unable to articulate a reason why he actually
needed an adjournment.
2.      There
is no dispute between the parties that the Tenant has been persistently late
paying his rent and has not paid the total rent he was required to pay for the
period from March 1, 2018 to May 31, 2018.  Since April of 2017 the Tenant has
been late paying the rent 12 times out of 14 months. Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective March 16, 2018.
3.      The
Tenant paid $1,321.00 after the application was filed.
4.      As
of the date of hearing before the Board the arrears of rent owing for the
period ending May 31, 2018 totalled $2,638.47. The lawful monthly rent is
$1,320.45.
5.      The
Landlord incurred costs of $190.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
6.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,320.45 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to
the Tenant for the period from July 1, 2017 to March 16, 2018 totalling $16.86.
7.      The
only real dispute between the parties is the Tenant’s request for relief from
eviction. He asks for an opportunity to repay the rent arrears and start paying
rent on time into the future. The Landlord opposes the Tenant’s request and
seeks an eviction order. 
8.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
for the reasons that follow find that it would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction subject to the conditions set out in this order pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. 
9.      This tenancy
began in 2014. The Tenant moved in with his spouse but he now lives alone. 
10.   The Tenant
works construction. He is a heavy machine operator. The Tenant says that he has
experienced a number of work interruptions and periods of unemployment since
2016. In 2016 his employer went bankrupt and he was laid off for several
months. He went onto Employment Insurance (‘EI’) and was mostly unemployed
until October of 2017. The Tenant was laid off again in December of 2017 and
was ineligible for EI due to insufficient weeks of employment. He did some work
under the table, borrowed from friends, exhausted savings, and in February of
2018 applied for Ontario Works. He says that he returned to work the day before
the hearing. 
11.   The Tenant
says his monthly employment earnings will be between $2,700.00 and $3,000.00.
His monthly expenses other than rent are about $1,245.00. This means the Tenant
has between $135.00 and $535.00 a month available to repay the rent arrears.
The Tenant states that he will have a roommate in June who will contribute
$600.00 a month towards the household income. In addition, he has contacted the
City’s EPIC program to apply for help paying off the rent arrears. 
12.   The Tenant
produced no supporting documentation corroborating his testimony. 
13.   In
response to my questions about the Landlord’s circumstances, the Landlord’s
representative said this is the first application to the Board with respect to
this tenancy although there have been numerous notices to terminate for
non-payment of rent. There have been no warning letters about the dangers of
paying rent persistently late. 
14.   So the
issue for the Board is whether or not it would be unfair in all of the circumstances
to grant the Tenant some relief from eviction. 
15.   The
Landlord argues that none of the Tenant’s evidence is corroborated, without a
roommate the Tenant cannot repay the rent arrears in a timely manner, and the
Tenant does not have a reliable plan for the future. The Landlord seeks
eviction. 
16.   What the
evidence establishes is that despite financial challenges this is the first
application to the Board about this tenancy in four years, so the Tenant has
demonstrated the capacity to deal with difficulties in the past. In addition,
the Landlord’s ledger indicates that in the 12 months during which rent was
paid late, it was still paid within the first week of the month for 7 of those
12 months. Given these circumstances it seems to me that it would not be unfair
to give the Tenant an opportunity to save the tenancy and start paying rent on
time. 
17.   That being
said, the precariousness of the Tenant’s earnings in the past suggests that a
repayment plan would not be advisable. The nature of the Tenant’s employment
appears to include regular lay off periods. The Landlord should not bear the
burden of that kind of cyclical dips in the Tenant’s finances. 
18.   Given all
of the above, an order will issue permitting the Tenant to avoid eviction for
non-payment of rent by repaying the rent arrears to the Landlord by June 15,
2018. If the Tenant can achieve a zero balance by that point in time then it
would not be unfair for the tenancy to continue subject to the requirement that
rent be paid on time. 
19.   This order
contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
It
is ordered that:
THE APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT
OF RENT
1.     Unless
the Tenant voids this part of the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated for non-payment of rent.  The Tenant
must move out of the rental unit on or before June 15, 2018.
2.     The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,246.74*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to May 29, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $43.41 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting May 30, 2018 to the date he moves out of the unit.
4.     The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.     If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June
9, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from June 10, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     If
the unit is not vacated on or before June 15, 2018, then starting June 16,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 16, 2018.
8.     If
the Tenant wishes to void this part of the order and continue the tenancy, he
must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)       $2,828.47 if the payment is made on or before May 31, 2018, or
ii)      $4,148.92 if the payment is made on or before June 15, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after June 16, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
THE APPLICATION FOR PERSISTENT LATE
PAYMENT OF THE RENT
10.  If the
Tenant voids the order above pursuant to paragraph 8 or 9 then:
(1)  The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord new rent on time and in full for the period
July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018;
(2)  If the
Tenant fails to make any one of the payments in accordance with subparagraph
10(1) of this order, the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to
the Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the
tenancy and evicting the Tenant and requiring that the Tenant pay any new
arrears, NSF fees and related charges that became owing after May 31, 2018.
