Review Order
 
S.K. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict M.T. and A.A. (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was resolved by order TEL-02811-19
issued on September 18, 2019. 
 
On September
27, 2019, the first-named Tenant requested a review of the order and that the
order be stayed until the request to review the order is resolved.
 
On October 1, 2019 interim order TEL-02811-19 -IN was
issued, staying the order issued on September 27, 2019
 
The request was heard in Whitby on October 28, 2019 where
it was granted, and a new hearing of the Landlord’s application was held which was
adjourned and completed on February 28, 2020. 
 
The Landlord and the Tenants attended the hearing. The
Landlord was assisted by her son, D.K.. 
 
Determinations:
 
REQUEST TO REVIEW
1.    The Tenants’ request to review alleges that the first-named
Tenant was not reasonably able to participate at the hearing on September 10, 2019
as she was taken by ambulance to the hospital due to chronic stomach issues. The
Tenant provided a copy of her medical documentation which showed that an ultrasound
was performed on her on September 10, 2019 at 9:37am. 
2.    When asked where the second-named Tenant was and
why he couldn’t attend, she said that they had broken up and could not be in the
same room as each other. The Tenant also testified that she attempted to contact
a representative but because it was last minute, she was unsuccessful. 
3.    The Landlord was not agreeable to the Tenant ’s request
for review. No further submissions were made by the Landlord. 
4.    Based on the evidence before the Board, I am satisfied
that the Tenant genuinely intended to participate at the hearing but was not able
to due to the medical emergency leading to her admission in the hospital. I say
this based on the Tenant’s evidence and supporting medical documentation. Thus,
the request to review is granted. 
5.    I proceeded to hear the Landlord’s L1 application
for arrears de novo. 
APPLICATION FOR ARREARS OF RENT
6.    By way of background, this is a month-to-month tenancy
in which the rent is due on the first of the month in the amount of $1,650.00. The
residential premises is a house which consists of the main floor, occupied by the
Landlord and the basement 3-bedroom unit which is occupied by the Tenants. 
7.    Interim Order TEL-02811-19-IN issued on October 31,
2019 terminated the tenancy November 17, 2019. The parties confirmed the Tenants
moved out on this date.
8.    The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from June 15, 2019 to November 17, 2019. 
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
July 9, 2019.
9.    Since the application was filed, the Tenants made no payments to the Landlord. 
10. The arrears and costs owing to November 17, 2019 total $6,981.09.

11. The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,650.00 from the
Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
12. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for
the period from October 16, 2018 to July 9, 2019.
13. The Landlord seeks a standard an order for the arrears and costs
owing to November 17, 2019. 
 
 
TENANT’S EVIDENCE & SECTION 82 CLAIMS
14. The Tenant does not dispute the arrears as claimed by the Landlord.
She testified that the reason she did not pay the Landlord is because of the issues
she had in her rental unit. The Tenant seeks an abatement, if not a full waiver
of the arrears due the issues. 
15. At the hearing the Tenants raised the following issues
pursuant to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'): 
a)   
Unavailability of her Parking
Spot; 
b)   
Laundry room lock-out; 
c)   
Flood in March 2019; 
d)   
Broken washing machine; 
e)   
Blocked private entrance; 
f)    
Lack of hand railing and crumbling
wall; 
g)   
Door being locked; and
h)  
Two incidents of harassment by
the Landlord. 
16. Section 82(1) of the Act states:
82 (1) At
a hearing of an application by a landlord under section 69 for an order
terminating a tenancy and evicting a tenant based on a notice of termination
under section 59, the Board shall permit the tenant to raise any issue that
could be the subject of an application made by the tenant under this Act.  
17. I proceeded to hear the Tenant’s claims under section 82 as
the Landlord indicated they were prepared to proceed.
PARKING SPOT NOT AVAILABLE
18. Section 7 of the tenancy agreement states that the Tenant is
entitled to one parking spot. 
19. Based on the agreement between the parties, the Tenant’s parking
spot was on the driveway in front of the house on the left side closest to the street.
The driveway had the capacity to hold nine cars.
20. The Tenant testified that while parking was included with her
rent based on the tenancy agreement, the Landlord failed to ensure her agreed upon
parking spot was consistently available for her to use. The Tenant logged the following
dates where her parking spot was not available: May 19, 2019, May 20, 2019, May
23, 2019, May 26, 2019, June 1, 2019, June 4, 2019, June 11, 2019, September 27,
2019 and October 27, 2019. The Tenant submitted
photographs of the driveway confirming that her spot was blocked on the dates she
had logged.
21. The Tenant explained that while she does not recall conversing
with the Landlord about her spot being unavailable on the dates logged. She asserts
that she was entitled to a parking spot whether or not she used it, so it was the
Landlord’s responsibility to ensure it was available for her at all times. 
22. The Landlord did not dispute the Tenant’s evidence that they
had blocked the Tenants’ parking spot. In fact, the Landlord’s response was that
once the Tenants stopped paying the rent, the Landlord stopped paying attention
to the parking arrangements. 
 
23. As a result, I accept the Tenant’s evidence that the Landlord
blocked her use of the driveway on May 19, 2019, May 20, 2019, May 23, 2019, May
26, 2019, June 1, 2019, June 4, 2019, June 11, 2019, September 27, 2019 and October
27, 2019. 
 
24. Sections 22 and 23 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 state:

 
22 A landlord shall not at any
time during a tenant’s occupancy of a rental unit and before the day on which
an order evicting the tenant is executed substantially interfere with the
reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or the residential complex in which it
is located for all usual purposes by a tenant or members of his or her household. 

 
23 A landlord shall not harass,
obstruct, coerce, threaten or interfere with a tenant.
 
25. The Landlord breached sections 22-23 of the Act by failing to
ensure that the Tenant was able to consistently use her assigned parking space thereby
interfering with the Tenant ’s reasonable enjoyment of the residential premises
(ie her ability to use the parking spot that was included in her lease). 
26. The Tenant did not specify the amount of abatement she was seeking
for this specific issue, just that the arrears be waived completely. I find that
a rent abatement of $50.00 for the lack of access to the Tenant ’s parking spot
on nine occasions is reasonable and shall be awarded. 
LAUNDRY ROOM LOCK-OUT
27. The Tenant testified that on June 2, 2019, the Tenant was in
the process of doing her laundry when the laundry room door was locked from the
other side. She could not get a hold of the Landlord, so she called the police who
came, spoke to the Landlord’s eldest son who then restored the Tenant ’s access
to the laundry room. The Tenant took her detergent and fabric softeners and uber-ed
to a laundromat to do her loads of laundry.
28. The Tenant testified that the same thing recurred on June 9,
2019. Since then, the Tenant has been doing laundry at her boyfriend’s home. 
29. The Tenant seeks $100.00 to recover the cost of her uber ride
for both days ($20.00 each way) as well as the cost of her loads ($30.00 each day).

30. The Landlord’s response was that the Tenant was using the laundry
machine on a weekday, which was not in compliance with the tenancy agreement; as
her assigned day to do laundry was Sunday. Further, the Landlord testified that
the Tenant was also in utility arrears, justifying the Landlord’s decision to lock
her out of the laundry room. 
31. Paragraph 4 of Schedule A attached to the tenancy agreement
states:
          “The premises shall be leased in its present condition
and shall include all existing … washer, dryer, dishwasher …”
32. The Landlord was unable to identify where the tenancy agreement
provides that Sunday is the Tenant’s assigned day of laundry. 
33. As the ability to do laundry in the rental unit was agreed
to and the Landlord acknowledged that the Tenant was prevented from accessing the
laundry room, I am satisfied that the Landlord withheld these services and breached
their obligations under the tenancy agreement. The Landlord’s conduct also constitutes
a breach sections 22 and 23 of the Act. The fact that the Tenant may have been in
utility arrears does not justify the Landlord’s conduct.
34. I find the Tenant’s request for $100.00 for out-of-pocket expenses
to be reasonable. The Landlord’s conduct of locking the Tenant out of the laundry
room resulted in her having to do laundry elsewhere. 
FLOOD IN MARCH 2019
35. The Tenant testified that at the end of March 2019 there was
a flood in her unit that came from the outside. She told the Landlord the same day
it occurred but stated that no one came to inspect it to see the extent of the damages.
The Tenant provided photographs that show the floors lifting. The Tenant stated
that the flood resulted in the formation of mould both in the living room and her
bedroom, which made her sick. No further medical documentation was submitted to
support this assertion. 
36. The Tenant confirmed that as of the date she moved out of the
rental unit, this issue was not addressed by the Landlord. The Tenant seeks a full
waiver of the arrears for this issue. 
37. The Landlord does not dispute that a flood occurred in the rental
unit or that there was damage to the floors. The Landlord explains that the Tenant
did ask for the floors to be fixed but that they required vacant possession of the
rental unit to facilitate the repairs. This is because the Tenant owns a dog and
often leaves the dog in the rental unit, making it impossible for work to be done.
38. Subsection 20(1) of the Act says: 
20(1) A landlord is responsible for providing and maintaining a
residential complex, including the rental units in it, in a good state of
repair and fit for habitation and for complying with health, safety, housing
and maintenance standards.
39. Case law holds that if a landlord does not complete necessary
repairs in a timely and effective manner, then an abatement of rent may be awarded.
The issue with the flooding in the rental unit occurred at the end of March 2019,
so the Landlord cannot be financially liable for any of the period before that
date. 
 
40. Based on the evidence before the Board I find that the Landlord
failed to repair the damage to flooring in the rental unit caused by the flooding
in a timely and effective manner. I say this based on the Landlord’s admission that
the work was not done because the Tenant’s dog resided in the rental unit. 
 
41. The problem with the Landlord’s justification of not doing the
work is that in general, tenants are permitted to have pets in their units. As long
as a landlord serves a proper notice of entry for work that needs to take placein
the rental unit, the tenant is responsible for ensuring their pets are caged or
not interfering with the work that needs to be done. 
42. I find that the Tenant is entitled to a rent abatement of $1,888.48
which is equal to 15%of the rent for the period between March 31, 2019 through to
November 17, 2019. This represents the approximate period when the Tenant resided
in the rental unit after the flood occurred. I find this remedy appropriate as the
Tenant’s uncontested evidence was that the lifting of the floors and formation of
mould was unaddressed and had a substantial negative impact on her health.
BROKEN LAUNDRY MACHINE
43. The Tenant testified that on June 16, 2019, she went to the
laundry room to put on a load, but the laundry machine was not working; an error
message saying “SUDS” showed up on the machine. The Tenant presented a photograph
of the error message that showed up on the laundry machine. She contacted the Landlord’s
son, who she usually communicated with when there was any issue. She testified that
this issue was ongoing since she the tenancy began in November 2018, and the Landlord
has taken no steps to rectify the problem. 
44. The Landlord’s response was that when the Tenant contacted him
about the issue on that day, he looked up the error message on the internet and
told the Tenant that she was using too much detergent, which resulted in a build-up
causing the error message to pop-up. He said that he paid his uncle $40.00 cash
to clean the machine and the Tenant was able to use the machine a few times afterwards.

45. Based on the evidence before me, the first report the
Landlord’s agent had of the issue with the washing machine was June 16, 2019. The
Landlord acted on the same day the Tenant complained by paying his uncle to fix
the washing machine, which the Tenant was able to use later. 
46. Thus, I find that the Tenant is not entitled to a remedy for
this issue as the Landlord had resolved it timely and effectively. There was no
evidence before me that the machine had issues after June 16, 2019. 
BLOCKED PRIVATE ENTRANCE
47. The Tenant testified that on May 19, 2019, May 23, 2019 and
June 1, 2019 the Landlord blocked her private entrance. She testified that there
was only one way in and out of the rental unit; walk around the side of the house
to a set of stairs that lead to her rental unit. 
48. Her evidence was that on May 19, 2019, the Landlord’s grandchildren
left a mess on the walkway, blocking her ability to get access to her rental unit.
Similarly, on May 23, 2019, a hose was left across the walkway path creating a tripping
hazard. The Tenant presented photographs of these incidents. 
49. Finally, on June 1, 2019 the Tenant complained to the Landlord’s
husband and daughter that the children were leaving toys sprawled across the walking
path. The Landlord’s response was that it was not the Tenant’s business what her
children do. 
50. The Tenant seeks general damages in the amount of $825.00 for
the incident on June 1, 2019. 
51. The Landlord accepts that the Tenant’s walkway was blocked due
to toys and kids’ items sprawled across the pathway and has indicated that he has
spoken to his nieces and nephews to be mindful of that going forward. 
52. The Landlord however disputes that the water hose was blocking
the Tenant’s entrance to her rental unit. 
53. Based on the evidence before me, I am inclined to agree with
the Landlord that the water hose, while unwrapped and unpleasant looking, did
not interfere with the Tenant ’s ability to enter and exit her rental unit nor did
it block her pathway. 
54. With respect to the toys sprawled across the pathway, I am inclined
to agree with the Tenant that this hindered and created a tripping hazard for her
to enter and exit her rental unit. 
55. I find the amount requested by the Tenant of $825.00 to be excessive.
The blockages of the Tenant’s pathway by the children’s toys only occurred twice
and was minimally invasive. Given my knowledge and experience in similar matters,
I find a rent abatement of 10% to be reasonable or $11.00 for the two incidents
and shall be rewarded.  
LACK OF HAND RAILING AND CRUMBLING WALL
56. The Tenant testified that on May 20, 2019, she complained to
the Landlord that the wall beside stairs leading to the rental unit is crumbling
but the Landlord failed to fix it. To the date she moved out of the rental unit,
this issue was not fixed. 
57. Furthermore, the Tenant testified that when the Tenants moved into the rental unit, the second-named Tenant
discussed with the Landlord the installation of a railing, which the Landlord agreed
to, but did not act upon. 
58. The Tenant seeks a full waiver of the arrears for these issues.

59. The Landlord’s response was that there was no discussion with
the Tenants regarding the installation
of a hand railing; further that the Tenant never complained of the crumbling wall
by the entrance to her rental unit. 
60. The Landlord did not dispute that the photographs entered
into evidence accurately depicted the rental unit at the time they were taken. The
photographs alone are sufficient to establish that the foundation by the front entrance
door was in disrepair and the Landlord was in breach of her maintenance and repair
obligations from May 20, 2019 to November 17, 2019. 
61. Based on the evidence before me I find that the Landlord failed
to address the Tenant’s concern of the crumbling wall in a timely and effective
manner. Even if the Tenant did not complain to the Landlord the state of the wall
should have been evident to the Landlord given its location. Thus, I find that the
Tenant is entitled to a rent abatement of 10% for this period or $986.44. 
62. With respect to the hand railing, as the Tenant was not present
when discussions allegedly took place between the Landlord and her ex, I find that
the evidence fails to establish that the Landlord promised to add a railing or was
in breach of her maintenance obligations for this issue. 
ILLEGAL LOCK OUT 
63. The Tenant testified that on July 26, 2019 she was at the rental
unit and had access to it. On July 28, 2019 when she returned to the rental unit,
she was discovered that she had been locked out. She states that the locks on her
door consist of two locks on the deadbolt and one on the door handle. She always
had keys to the deadbolt but never for the door handle. 
64. She called the police to get access as the Landlord was not
available. The police arrived at the rental unit the next morning and were able
to give back access to the Tenant. 
65. The Tenant testified that the lockout was an inconvenience to
her; she had planned to move her items out that weekend delay in moving her items
as her kids were not with her that weekend. 
66. The Landlord denies locking the Tenant out from the rental unit
and suggests that the Tenant might have lost her key or hit the partial lock. The
Landlord initially disputed the fact that the police attended the residential premises
that day to allow entry into the rental unit. D.K. testified that the Tenant texted
him that she had been locked out of her rental unit and that he had to go into her
unit through the laundry room to provide access. On cross-examination, the Landlord
responded that he never denied that the police were called; he is certain that his
brother went down to open the door. 
67. The problem with the Landlord’s claim that the Tenant was not
locked out is that the Tenant presented a video of her attempting to open the locks
with her keys and was unsuccessful as it appears the door handle lock was enabled.
I find that the Landlord’s contradictory statements significantly undermine the
credibility of the Landlord’s evidence with respect to this issue and thus, I prefer
the evidence of the Tenant. 
68. Thus, based on the evidence before the Board I find that the
Landlord is in breach of section 24 of the Act; specifically, that the Tenant was
illegally locked out of her rental unit on July 28, 2019 and was only given possession
of the unit the following day. I find that the Tenant is entitled to a rent abatement
of 100% for that day (July 28, 2019) or $54.25. 
69. I find further that the Tenant is entitled to $1,000.00 in damages
for this incident. I say this because whether or not the Tenant resided in the rental
unit full-time, she had a lease agreement with the Landlord that gave her the right
to occupy the rental unit, which the Landlord unilaterally interfered with on July
28, 2019 by locking her out. 

An illegal lock-out can have a significant
     impact on tenants that lasts well beyond the moment in time when the entry
     is denied. So, it is inappropriate to calculate abatement solely based on
     the rent paid for the few minutes, hours or days during which the illegal
     entry occurs. This was implicitly recognized by the Divisional Court in Wrona
     v. Toronto Community Housing Corp., [2007] O.J. No. 423 (Ont. Div.
     Ct.). 

 

One of the elements present in Wrona
     was the fact that the tenant had made a previous complaint to the Tribunal
     about the landlord’s behaviour in terms of entry, so the landlord knew or
     ought to have known getting the notice of entry right was important to the
     tenant. Although there was no previous application to the Board by these
     Tenants, this can also be said here with respect to the illegal lockout on
     July 28, 2019. The Landlord knew or ought to have known about the
     requirements for changing the locks and/or terminating the tenancy in a legal
     manner and how upset the Tenant would be by her illegal lockout but she
     went ahead anyway. 
Given the above, I believe the Tenants would
     be entitled to a further $1,000.00 in abatement of the rent for the lockout
     that occurred on July 28, 2019 for a total of $1,054.25.

HARASSMENT
73. The Tenant testified that the Landlord and her family harassed
her on at least three separate occasions.
74. On June 1, 2019 there was a heated argument between the Landlord’s
daughter and the Tenant and the Landlord’s daughter began to scream “get out of
here,” “you little shit” and “shut up” to the Tenant. The Tenant presented an audio
recording of this conversation which corroborates her evidence.  
75. Then on July 20, 2019, the Tenant was outside in her bathing
suit and the Landlord’s son, D.K., told her to put more clothes on as she was interfering
with his view and finally on June 23, 2019 the Landlord was conducting a walkthrough
of the rental unit and badgering the Tenant to leave. 
76. The Tenant seeks one month rent compensation for these incidents
in the amount of $1,650.00.
77. The Landlord did not
wish to respond to the allegations of harassment. 
78. While the word harassment itself is not defined under the
Act but a commonly accepted definition is harassment is conduct that a
reasonable landlord knows or ought to know the reasonable tenant would find
upsetting and objectionable. 
79. Based on the Tenant’s uncontested evidence on these issues,
I find that the Landlord was in breach of sections 22 and 23 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006. The evidence establishes that the Landlord harassed the Tenant
on June 1, 2019, July 20, 2019 and June 23, 2019. 
80. Given the above and my experience of like cases before the
Board the Tenant’s request for abatement in the amount of $1,650.00 appears to be
excessive; I find that a rent abatement of $825.00 is reasonable and an order
shall issue accordingly. 
COMPLIANCE WITH INTERIM ORDER
81.  An interim order was issued on October 31, 2019, which required
the Landlord to provide the Tenant with unrestricted access to the driveway to facilitate
her move out and listed a series of dates that her side was to be kept free between
the hours of 12:00am – 11:59pm. 
82. The Tenant testified that the Landlord failed to comply with
this paragraph of the interim order; specifically, the Landlord blocked access on
November 17, 2019 at 12:22pm, when the Tenant came by to move her items. 
83. The Landlord initially denied the allegation and then responded
saying perhaps some friends came over and they didn’t know. 
84. The Board’s Interpretation Guideline #3 on Costs outlines scenarios
where it would be appropriate for the Board to order costs against party which includes
where a party has failed to follow a Member’s directions. 
85. Interim orders are issued to facilitate resolution of disputes
while a hearing is ongoing and the consequence of not following an interim order
is clearly laid out in paragraph 5 of the interim order. 
86. While I am not bound to the Board’s Guidelines, I see no reason
not to follow it in this instance. I find it appropriate to order $100.00 in Board
costs against the Landlord in the circumstances. This amount must be paid on or
before April 30, 2020. For the Landlord’s information, pursuant to section 196
of the RTA and Rule 6 of the Rules of Practice, failure to pay costs ordered to
be paid to the Board may result in the Board refusing to allow the filing of an
application; a stay in proceedings; a delay in the issuance of an order; and/or
a discontinuance of the proceeding.
87. I further find that the Tenant is entitled to a rent abatement
of $100.00 for this issue. I say this because one of the issues raised by the Tenant
at the hearing was that the Landlord was blocking their parking space. The Landlord
effectively acknowledged the alleged conduct when he said that he stopped caring
after the Tenant had stopped paying rent. 
88. The Landlord knew or ought to have known that by further blocking
the Tenant ’s parking space to move out of the rental unit, the Tenant’s ability
to move out of the rental unit would be unreasonably impeded and the Tenant would
become upset. Further, by repeating the behaviour that was complained of, the Landlord
showed a complete disregard for the Act and the Tenant’s concerns.
REMEDIES
89. Based on the above, I find that the Tenants are entitled to
an abatement of rent of in the amount of $5,015.17 for the following
issues: blocked parking, no access to the laundry room, flood in the rental unit,
blockage of the private entrance to the rental unit, crumbling wall, illegal lockout
and the incidents of harassment as well as $100.00 for the Landlord’s non-compliance
with the interim order resulting in a delay in the Tenant ’s ability to move out
her items. This amount shall be deducted from the rent arrears owing by the Tenants.
90. As I stated at the hearing, the Act does not allow a tenant
to withhold rent, nor is a landlord relieved from their responsibilities if a tenant
does not pay the rent. The parties are strongly encouraged to review their
rights and responsibilities under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006. 
91. An order shall issue accordingly. 
92. This order contains all of the reasons for my decision
within it. No further reasons shall be issued.   
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The application is amended to
correct the first name of the Landlord. 
2.     
The request to review order TEL-02811-19
issued on September 18, 2019 is granted.
3.     
The interim order issued on October
1, 2019 is cancelled.
4.     
Order TEL-02811-19 issued on
September 18, 2019 is cancelled and replaced by the following order.
5.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenants is terminated as of November 17, 2019.
6.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $1,675.92*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to November 17, 2019, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit and less the amount of the abatement the Landlord owes the
Tenants.
7.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
8.     
The total amount owing under
this order is $1,865.92.
9.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing on or before April 27, 2020, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from April
28, 2020 at .00% annually on the balance outstanding.
10.  
The Landlord shall pay to the
Board $100.00 in Board costs for their lack of compliance with the interim order
issued on October 31, 2019. This amount shall be paid to the Board on or before
April 30, 2020. 
 
11.  
If the Landlord fails to pay
in accordance with paragraph 10 of this order, the outstanding balance shall
