Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: SWL-16394-18











 

NR (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict KW and AB (or collectively the 'Tenants')
because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in [CITY] on
June 25, 2018.  The Landlord’s Legal Representative, SA, attended the hearing. 
The Tenant’s Legal Representative, SH, and the Tenants also attended the
hearing.  All my reasons are contained in this Order.  No further reasons will
be issued. 
 
Preliminary Issue: Credibility
 
I misspoke in this
hearing noting at the end that I considered the Tenant’s evidence credible.  I
ought to have said that the Tenant’s evidence was, in my view, genuine and
honest.  The difference being that I do not consider the Tenant’s evidence
sufficient to meet the onus and demonstrate the allegations she made are
accurate, despite my conclusion that the Tenant believes this to be true.  
 
The Issues in Dispute
 
The Tenants, after
reviewing the Landlord’s documentation at the outset of this hearing, accepted
that the amount of arrears claimed to June 30, 2018 is accurate and correct. 
There were therefore only two issues before me.  
 
First, the Tenants
requested a repayment plan lasting eight months as a result of one Tenant’s
status as a person with a disability and reliance on income supports to that
end.  The Tenants would find prompt repayment financially burdensome, whereas
the arrears owed to date are not very large and the Tenants have shown good
faith in making significant payments to the date of this hearing.
 
Second, pursuant to
section 82 of the Act the Tenant, KW, requested compensation in the amount of
three months’ rent ($3,036.30) on the basis of the Landlord’s alleged conduct
which KW felt substantially interfered with her enjoyment of the rental unit
and constituted harassment.  KW also argued the Landlord illegally entered the
rental unit on several unspecified occasions.  AB elected not to participate in
this aspect of the hearing and did not wish to pursue remedies under section 82
of the Act.  
 
The Tenants were
cautioned that if the allegations were not proven on a balance of
probabilities, these matters would be considered res judicata going
forward, meaning that a separate Tenants’ application could not be filed with
respect to the same grounds.  The Tenants (who were represented) expressed that
this was understood and KW elected to proceed in any event despite not having
any documentary evidence or additional witnesses, including AB who refused to
testify on these matters. 
 
KW testified that the
Landlord entered the rental unit without providing notice on several
occasions.  KW was not able to provide any dates of entry.  Thus, lacking any
specifics, I cannot determine that the Landlord was responsible for entry
without notice.  
 
KW also testified that
the Landlord moved her glasses, took her laundry – though it was returned at a
later date, and put a hole in one of her tomatoes.  KW felt that the Landlord
was responsible for a campaign of aggravation designed to frustrate and upset
KW.  This included refusing to help KW move her furniture on the date she took
possession of the rental unit and making various noises on unspecified dates. 
I was not presented with any evidence that the Landlord agreed to move KW’s
furniture or in any way was responsible for the same.  I was not presented with
dates or times of any complaint raised by KW or any corroborative evidence from
any external source.  
 
In Ball v. Metro
Capital Property, [2002] O.J. No. 5931 (Divisional Court), the Court held that
to succeed in raising an allegation, specific information must be provided so
that the responding party is able to meaningfully reply to the allegations. 
The Tenants did not provide sufficient details to support these allegations or
to conclude that the Landlord is responsible for behaviour that amounts to
substantial interference with their reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or
harassment in this instance.  
 
The Landlord’s Legal
Representative argued that there are many other, equally plausible,
explanations for the Tenant’s experience and I agree.  It is as likely as not
that the items “moved” by the Landlord were simply mislaid by the Tenant, or a
guest of the rental unit.  There is no reliable basis on which I am able to
conclude that the Landlord is responsible for the actions the Tenant
described.  The details provided by the Tenant, and the supporting evidence,
were simply too scant to withstand any scrutiny.  
 
This is not to suggest
that I considered the Tenant’s evidence dishonest or even deliberately vague. 
I found the Tenant genuine in her belief, but her assumptions are unlikely to
be accurate no matter how earnestly she considers this to be so.  As a result,
I find on a balance of probabilities that the Tenants did not meet the onus in
demonstrating that the Landlord harassed or substantially interfered with their
reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit up to the date of this hearing.   
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent they were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2017 to
June 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective April 25, 2018.
2.     
The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit. 
3.     
The monthly rent is $1,012.10.
4.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $950.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from February 1, 2017 to April 25, 2018.
6.     
The Tenants paid $1,945.00
after the application was filed.
7.     
The parties agree that the
amount outstanding to June 30, 2018, inclusive of rent arrears ($648.00), and
costs ($190.00), is $838.00. 
8.     
I am not satisfied that the
Landlord is responsible for the behaviour that KW alleged.  The Landlord’s
Legal Representative argued that the Tenant’s complaints might just as easily
have been attributed to another tenant in the residential complex, or to the
other Tenant in this rental unit, AB.  I agree that the Tenant failed to
demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that the Landlord is responsible for
the behaviour the Tenant described.  
9.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.  I accepted the Tenants’
repayment plan as this appeared likely to be followed by the Tenants, likely to
preserve the tenancy which is in keeping with the purposes of the Act, and
unlikely to cause significant prejudice to the Landlord given the good faith
payments made recently and the relatively minimal arrears owed on the date of
the hearing.
On consent of the parties, it is ordered
that:
 
1.      The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $838.00, which represents the
arrears of rent ($648.00), and costs ($190.00) outstanding for the period
ending June 30, 2018.
2.      The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenants is denied on
the condition that:
(a)  The
Tenants shall make the following payments to the Landlord in respect of the
monies owing under paragraph 1 of this order:



Date Payment Due

$104.75

(b)  The
Tenants shall also pay the Landlord the rent for the month of July 2018 by July
16, 2018; and for the months of August 2018 to February 2019 (inclusive) in
full, and on the first of each corresponding month.   
3.      If the Tenants fail to make any of the payments in accordance with
paragraph 2, and by the dates required, then:
(a)      The Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenant, and for the payment of any new arrears of rent and NSF
charges not already ordered under paragraph 1 of this order. The Landlord must
make the application within 30 days of a breach of a condition set out in
paragraph 2 of this order. 
(b)      The balance owing under paragraph 1 of this order shall become
payable on the day following the date of default. The monies owing shall bear
interest at the post-judgment interest rate determined under subsection 207(7)
of the Act.
