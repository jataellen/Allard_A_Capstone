Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006










 
 

AR
or the 'Landlord' applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict MM or
the 'Tenant' because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.  (L1
Application)
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the
Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with
the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord
or another tenant; and because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying
the Tenant's rent. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the
Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the undue damage caused to the rental
unit
(L2 Application)
 
These
applications were heard in Mississauga on March 12, 2019.   Only the Landlord and the Landlord’s Agent, IG, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 Application
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from December 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective February 1, 2019.
2.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,395.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
3.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from November 1, 2016
to February 1, 2019.
L2
Application
4.     
The first N5 notice of termination underlying the application was
served on December 27, 2018, and clearly identifies, inter alia, that
the Tenant altered the rental unit locking system, and not giving the Landlord
new keys to access the unit.  The second N5 notice was served on the tenants on
January 13, 2019, stating that Tenant had not corrected the locking system
problem, and then included a new claim that the Tenant had installed a security
camera on the rental unit without consent of the Landlord.  The Landlord
requires the Tenant in the second N5 to remove the camera and repair/restore
the building to as it was.   Under the L2 application itself, the Landlord
requests an order under section 89 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the ‘Act’), for the Tenant to pay the Landlord $500.00 for the
repair/restoration of the building after having to remove the camera.  
5.      The
Tenant was also served an N8 notice on December 27, 2018, claiming persistent
lateness in paying rents.
The N5
notices
6.      The
Landlord testified that when responding to an issue the Tenant had raised on December
21, 2018, he noticed the lock on the rental unit had been changed, and his keys
no longer were able to turn the new lock.  The Tenant was not at the rental
unit when the Landlord had arrived.
7.      Subsequently,
the Landlord requested the Tenant to resolve the problem and when this failed,
the Landlord testified he served the first N5 notice on the Tenant.  The
Landlord also contacted the Rental Housing Enforcement unit, which then
contacted the Tenant (as far as the Landlord is aware).  
8.      The
Landlord believes that because the Rental Housing Enforcement’s involvement,
the Tenant changed the locking system back to the original lock on or about
January 6, 2019, just outside the 7-day voiding period under the N5 notice. 
9.      Based
on the technicality that the N5 notice was not voided on time – that is, under
subsection 64(3) of the Act --  the Landlord served a second N5 notice on the
Tenant, but then added a new rental unit claim respecting an unauthorized
installation of a security camera.
10.   The
Landlord testified on or about December 20, 2018, he found the Tenant had
installed a security camera to the outside wall of the rental unit building and
hardwired the camera to the interior of the building. (reference exhibit LL#1)
11.   The
Landlord testified that subsequently, the tenants in the basement apartment
complained about the installed camera, as they were worried that their privacy
would be compromised.  The Landlord was equally concerned and consequently
served the second N5 notice on the Tenant.
12.   As
of the date of this hearing, the Landlord testified the Tenant has not removed
the security camera and has not repaired/restored the rental unit building to
its original condition.
13.   Based
on the uncontested submissions, and relying upon section 204 of the Act, I find
that the first N5 notice was adequately voided.  Under the first N5 notice, the
Tenant was given until January 3, 2019 to resolve the locking system issue, and
this was essentially resolved on January 6, 2019.    The second N5 notice was
served on January 13, 2019 and claimed the locking system problem was still an
issue, but it was not.  While the Tenant technically missed the 7-day window to
void by a few days, the lock problem was resolved well before the second N5
notice was issued.
14.   Based
on my finding, therefore, the second N5 notice becomes invalid.  The reason for
that is:  with the first N5 notice being voided as I have determined above, the
second N5 notice now becomes a new, first N5 notice, which requires a 20-day
period between its service and the termination date thereupon.  That new notice
was served on January 13, 2019 and set out a termination date of January 28,
2019 which is only 15 days in length.  The new N5 notice therefore fails to
comply with subsection 64(2)(a) of the Act.
15.   Consequently,
the claim in that new N5 notice (served on January 13, 2019) relating to the
unauthorized security camera falls away.  The only claim remaining, as a
result, is under section 89 of the Act respecting the undue damage claim for having
to remove the camera and repairing/restoring the rental unit building. 
16.   The
Landlord submitted exhibit LL#2, which is a copy of an estimate by an
arms-length contractor to remove the camera, fill/repair the holes to the
outside wall and to repair the drywall inside the rental unit.  I find the
quotation of $500.00 plus taxes to be a reasonable estimation of costs to
repair/restore the rental unit building due.  I find in favour of the Landlord
in respect of this section 89 claim for undue damage and will order $565.00
(includes HST) to be paid by the Tenant.
The N8
notice
17.   The
Landlord confirmed from the N8 notice that had been served on the Tenant that
the Tenant was late with e-transfer rent payments for five of the seven months
of December 2017 to June 2018.  
18.   As
well, the Landlord submitted that since the filing of the application, the
Tenant has made no rent payments since December 2018, so that the Tenant has
been late for paying rents for all four months between December 2018 and March
2019.
19.   Based
on the uncontested submissions taken all together, I find that the Tenant has
been persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
20.   The
Landlord confirmed the requested remedy of a final, non-remedial eviction order
based on the finding of persistent lateness.  If a final termination is
granted, the Landlord requested that the L1 application be amended to only
order the arrears under the application.
Section
83
21.   I
have considered all of the Act, and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.   I am granting
the non-remedial termination the Landlord has requested.  With respect to the
L1 application, therefore, the order below only sets out the arrears,
compensation and costs owing under the L1 application.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated in a final
(non-remedial) way.  
2.      The
Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before April 12, 2019.
3.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4,064.18*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to April 1, 2019, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $45.86 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting April 2, 2019 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
5.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
6.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $565.00, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the undue damage
caused by the Tenant in respect of the security camera installation.
7.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before April
12, 2019, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from April 13, 2019 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
8.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 12, 2019, then starting April 13,
2019, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 13, 2019.
