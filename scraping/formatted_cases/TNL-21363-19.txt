Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-21363-19
 











 
 

GHL. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict (BP), MP), and (RP) (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on January 16,
2020.
 
The Landlord’s representative, KA
and the Tenant, (MP) attended the hearing.
 
Also in attendance at the hearing
was MP, occupant and sister of Tenant, MP and HG, EPIC Caseworker.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September
1, 2019 to January 31, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a
Notice of Termination effective September 23, 2019.
2.     
The monthly rent as of the
date of the hearing is $1,652.93.
3.     
There was no dispute that
the Tenants owe the Landlord $8,454.65, which represents the arrears of rent to
January 31, 2020, and the application filing fee. 
4.     
The Tenants moved into the
unit in February 2017. 
5.     
Tenant, MP testified that
his mother, BP is deceased as of March 15, 2019 and his father, RP left in July
2019. MP will provide the Landlord with a copy of his mother’s death certificate.

6.     
MP testified that he has not
paid the rent because he has been dealing with legal matters and the funeral
expenses. Also, in August 2019, he paid over $4,000.00 because the Tenants were
in arrears of rent. MP says that he would give his father money to pay the
rent, and he did not know that his father was not paying the rent. MP says that
he has now taken over the household. 
7.     
MP testified that he has a
monthly income of $2,800.00 and that he will be starting a new job that will
pay more. His sister is employed and has a monthly income of $1,400.00. MP
stated that his cousin will be moving into the unit and will also help with the
rent.
8.     
The Tenants brought
$2,200.00 (money order) to the hearing and requested relief. The Tenants
proposed a payment plan for the arrears and stated that they could pay the rent
when due. 
9.     
The Landlord opposed the
payment plan and submitted that the Tenants fell into arrears shortly after
moving into the unit. The Landlord also submitted that they have come to the
Board many times to get the Tenants to pay the arrears. 
10.  
As I stated at the hearing,
I will give the Tenants an opportunity to continue the tenancy. I considered
the passing of MP’s mother and that he and his sister are 22, and 21 years of
age, respectively, and are on their own without their parents. I also
considered that the Tenants brought $2,200.00 to the hearing and I am of the
view that this is an act of good faith. I also explained to MP that he placed
the tenancy in jeopardy by not paying any funds towards the rent and giving
other expenses priority over the rent. 
11.  
At the hearing, the Tenants
gave the Landlord the money order for $2,200.00. This means that the arrears of
rent to January 31, 2020 has been reduced to $6,254.65.
12.  
 I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction
subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection
83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.  
13.   I explained to the Tenants that they must pay the arrears in accordance
with their payment plan. I also explained section 78 of the Act to the Tenants
and the consequences if they failed to pay the arrears and the rent.  I am
satisfied that the Tenants understood the consequences of not complying with
the order.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Tenants shall pay the
Landlord $6,254.65, which represents the arrears of rent owing up to January
31, 2020 ($6,064.65), plus the Landlord’s application filing fee ($190.00).
2.     
The Tenants shall pay the
amount set out in paragraph 1, above, according to the following schedule:

                                         On

                                         On

arrears and NSF fees and related charges that become owing after January 31,
2020.
