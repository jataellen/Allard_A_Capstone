B.B. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict J.E., R.K. and B.M. (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in
Whitby on October 26, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid the total rent they
were required to pay for the period from June 1, 2018 to October 31, 2018. 
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
September 5, 2018.
2.     
At the hearing the Tenants raised the following
issue pursuant to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act').
 
3.     
The issue raised was over the general condition
of the main bathroom.
 
4.     
The Landlord through an employee (who has since
been fired) was told of problems in the bathroom including poor condition of
caulking and possible mold under the tiles.
 
5.     
The Landlord had stated that this person was
hired in February of 2018 and the Tenants claim to have brought this
information to him in May of 2018.
 
6.     
Nothing has ever happened to make these repairs.
 
7.     
I find on the balance of probabilities that the
Landlord’s employee was aware of the problems and no action was taken.
 
8.     
I have assessed a 5% rental abatement for 6
months and will order that the repairs be made.
 
9.     
This then is 6 x 5% x $1,725.00 = $517.50. This
amount will be used against the outstanding arrears.
 
10.   The Tenants also claimed that there is a problem with the smoke
detectors and carbon monoxide detectors in the home however the Landlord denied
this allegation and the Tenants did not have any evidence of problems while
they did have pictures of the bathroom condition.
 
11.   As a result there will be no award for the detectors however the
Landlord will be ordered to verify their proper working condition over the next
10 days.
 
12.   I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance
with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until November
15, 2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out
below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The
Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before November 15, 2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$8,060.11*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to
October 30, 2018 and less the amount of the abatement the Landlord owes the
Tenants.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$56.71 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting October 31,
2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before November 15, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe
interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from November 16, 2018 at
3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated on or before November
15, 2018, then starting November 16, 2018, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord, on or after November 16, 2018.
8.     
If the Tenants wish to void this order and
continue the tenancy, they must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $8,282.50 if the payment is made on or before October 31, 2018, or
ii)       $10,007.50 if the payment is made on or before November 15, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after November 16, 2018 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
10.   The Landlord will ensure the safe operation of the smoke detectors
and the carbon monoxide detector on or before November 10, 2018 and inform the
Tenants of his findings.
11.   The Landlord will ensure that all problems associated with the bathroom
are fully repaired by no later than November 30, 2018.
