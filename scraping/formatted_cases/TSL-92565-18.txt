Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-92565-18
 











 
 

H.I.I. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict S.H (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has
also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for
the damage. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on March 28,
2018.
 
Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
 
I was satisfied that the Notice of
Hearing was properly served to the Tenant and proceeded with the hearing
without the Tenant being present.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 Arrears
 
1.   
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the
Tenant was required to pay for the period from January 1, 2018 to March 31,
2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective January 18, 2018.
2.   
The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit
at the time the application was filed with the Board.
3.   
Based on the uncontested evidence of the
Landlord, I am satisfied that the Tenant is in arrears for the rent for the
period of January 1 to March 31, 2018.
4.   
The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $863.99
from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
5.   
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenant for the period from December 1, 2017 to January 18, 2018.
L2 Negligent Damage
6.   
The Landlord’s evidence is that the Tenant
stored combustible material on the balcony of the rental unit and ignored
warnings from the Landlord not to do so and requests to keep the balcony clean. 
 The Landlord submitted into evidence an Order from a City of Toronto Municipal
Standards officer dated October 18, 2017, indicating the balcony of the rental
unit was not maintained in a clean and/or sanitary condition, and that it was
covered with pigeon feces, refuse and is to be cleaned and sanitized.  The
Landlord indicated that this Order was communicated to the Tenant.
7.   
According to the Landlord, a fire occurred on the
balcony on December 4, 2017, requiring the attendance of the Toronto Fire
Service to put it out. The Landlord’s evidence is that the Fire Marshall
concluded that the fire was likely caused by a lit cigarette falling on the
accumulated refuse on the balcony. 
8.   
Although the Fire Marshall was not in attendance
to testify, the evidence before me was uncontested.  I find it plausible that a
fire would be caused by a cigarette falling on accumulated refuse. Based on the
uncontested evidence, I find that the Tenant negligently left combustible
materials on the balcony of the rental unit which caught fire on December 4,
2017, resulting in a fire on the balcony and significant damage to the rental
unit.
9.   
The photographs submitted by the Landlord show
extensive smoke and fire damage throughout the rental unit, including the
charring of walls, ceilings, floor, doors (both interior and exterior), doorways,
windows, kitchen counter, cabinets, accumulation of ash, and physical damage to
the doors, windows, and walls caused during the act of putting out the fire.
10.
The Landlord submitted a report from the STR
Engineering Inc. dated January 30, 2018, which stated the following damages to
the unit: 
•       
The floor slab was blackened and covered by fire
ash. No unusual concrete crack or delamination was identified on the surface of
the slab; 
•       
The exterior ceiling slab was blackened and its
paint was peeled off.  No unusual concrete crack or delamination was identified
underside surface of the slab; 
•       
The drywall of the interior ceiling slab was
damaged; 
•       
The balcony handrail was deformed due to the
fire, and the steel panels were damaged.
 
11.
In addition, the City of Toronto’s Order to
Remedy Unsafe Building dated December 13, 2017, states the following:
“As a direct
result of substantial fire on December 4th 2017 regarding two units
614 and 615. There have been extensively damaged by fire creating an unsafe
condition as follow. 1. Balconies guard panels and members had been damaged and
unsafe for occupancy.   2. Ceiling cracks and damaged ceiling plastering were
found.(sic)”
12.
The Landlord testified that she estimates the
cost of $14,400.00 for the total repairs required to bring the unit back to a
liveable condition.  This estimate has been developed from information she has received
from various contractors concerning the identified work that is required to
repair the unit.  
13.
The Landlord does not have written estimates
from the individual contractors and the contractors have not visited the site
as the Landlord does not yet have possession of the unit.  The contractors’
estimates were based largely on the photographs taken by the Landlord and
submitted as evidence to the Board, as well as the Landlord’s descriptions, the
City’s order and the report from STR Engineering Inc. as already cited.
14.
I take into consideration the fact that the
Landlord is experienced in managing large multi-unit residential buildings and
has regular dealings with the contractors she consulted who are also experienced
in doing repairs and renovations in such buildings.
15.
The Divisional Court stated in Beauge v.
Metcap Living Management Inc., 2012 ONSC 1160 (CanLII) that the Board may
make a reasonable estimate with respect to replacement costs in the absence of
receipts or third party evidence. 
16.
In this case I am dealing with the cost of
necessary repair to bring the rental unit back to a habitable condition but the
same reasoning in Beauge ought to apply. Based on the documents
submitted by the Landlord, including photographs of the rental unit taken by
the Landlord after the fire, the Order to Remedy Unsafe Building issued by the
City of Toronto dated December 13, 2017, the Balcony Structural Assessment
letter from STR Engineering Inc. dated January 30, 2018, and the uncontested
evidence of the Landlord, I am satisfied that the damage to the unit is
extensive and the Landlord’s estimate of $14,400.00 to be a reasonable cost of
repair to the unit.
17.
The Landlord is under threat of legal action by
the City to complete the repairs as evidenced by the City’s Notice of Court
Action dated January 12, 2018.  I am satisfied that the Tenant is still in
possession of the unit and that the Landlord requires urgent possession in
order to complete the repairs and renovation to the rental unit as ordered.
S. 83 Considerations
18.
I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances, and in particular the uninhabitable and unsafe living conditions
as a result of the fire, in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').  I find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant
is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before April
8, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,832.78,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to April 5, 2018,
less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $28.41
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting April 6, 2018 to the
date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay the Landlord
$14,400.00 for damages caused by the fire resulting from the Tenant’s
negligence.
5.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
6.     
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before April 16, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe
interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from April 17, 2018 at 3.00%
annually on the balance outstanding.
7.     
If the unit is not vacated on or before April 8,
2018, then starting April 9, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord, on or after April 9, 2018.
