Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-94823-18
 










 
 

A.C.L
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict F.M and
I.W (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe (“the L1 application”).
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenants because the Tenants have been persistently late in paying the rent
(“the L2 application”).
 
These
applications were heard in Toronto on June 14, 2018.
 
Only
the Landlord’s legal representative, D.C, attended the hearing.
 
The
Tenants did not attend the hearing, although I was satisfied that they received
proper notice of the time, place and location of the hearing.  Nonetheless, I
waited until after 10 a.m.  When the Tenants still did not arrive, I proceeded
to hear the Landlord’s applications.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from December 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective April 8, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenants paid $1,050.00 after the L1 application was filed.
 
3.      With
respect to the L1 application, at the hearing, DC submitted a written summary
showing that the amount claimed by the Landlord for arrears of rent is $5,648.57
for arrears of rent and $190.00 for the filing fee.
 
4.      The
Tenants have been persistently late in paying their rent.  The uncontested
evidence before me is that the Tenants have paid their rent late consecutively
from May 2017 through June 2018 inclusive.
 
5.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $2,075.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2018
to April 8, 2018.
 
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
L1 application
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the L1 portion of this order as set out below (and subject to
the L2 portion of this order below), the tenancy between the Landlord and the
Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before July 1, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $2,853.58*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to June 20, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $69.24 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting June 21, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before July 1,
2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from July 2, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before July 1, 2018, then starting July 2, 2018,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 2, 2018.
 
8.      If
the Tenants wish to void the L1 portion of this order and continue the tenancy
to July 1, 2018 (as set out in the L2 portion of this order below), they must pay
to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $5,838.51 if the payment is made on or before June 30, 2018, or
ii)       $7,944.63 if the payment is made on or before July 1, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside the L1 portion of this order (subject to the L2 portion of this order
below) if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after July
2, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
L2
application
10.   If
the Tenants void the L1 portion of this order by paying the amount to the
Landlord as required under paragraph 8 above, the tenancy shall continue to
July 1, 2018 on which date the tenancy is terminated for persistent late
payment of rent.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
July 1, 2018.
 
11.   As
of the date of this order, the amount the Landlord is holding for the rent
deposit and the interest owing on the deposit exceeds the amount the Tenants
owe for compensation by $2,093.52.
 
12.   The
Landlord is authorized to offset from the amount the Landlord owes the Tenants
the following amounts: $69.24 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
from July 1, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit
 
13.   The
Landlord may collect from the Tenants any amounts that become owing as a result
of this order.


14.   If
the unit is not vacated on or before July 1, 2018, then starting July 2, 2018,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
15.   Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after July 2, 2018.
