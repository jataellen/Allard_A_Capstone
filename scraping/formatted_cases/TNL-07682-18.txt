Order
under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-07682-18



 


 


 



 
 
GY
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict AJ
(the 'Tenant') because she has been persistently late in paying her rent. 
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on October 3, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
 Determinations:
 
1.      The
rental unit is a two bedroom apartment in a small building having 14
apartments.
 
2.      The
Tenant lives in the rental unit with her 2 adult sons, the wife of one of her
sons and their 3 year old child. 
 
3.      The
Landlord and Tenant have been to the Board on 4 prior occasions when the
Landlord has sought to terminate the tenancy for failure to pay rent. 
 
4.      On
each of the prior occasions, the Board member refused to evict the Tenant
despite significant arrears of rent because the Tenant complained of a mouse
infestation. The Board member was not satisfied with the Landlord’s efforts to
address the mouse infestation. The most recent order was TNL-99131-17 issued on
December 13, 2017.
 
5.      The
Tenant has not paid rent since January 2018. According to her she is
“withholding” rent because she continues to experience mice in the rental unit. 
A tenant is not entitled to withhold rent for any reason. If a tenant believes
that the landlord is in breach of the landlord’s obligations under the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), the Tenant can and should bring an
application to the Board to deal with the issue.
 
6.      The
Landlord appears to be a relatively unsophisticated person who has some
difficulty explaining himself. The Landlord has made several attempts to
address the mouse and roach infestation in the rental unit, both before and
after the December 13, 2017 hearing.
 
7.      The
Tenant has refused entry to the Landlord’s pest control person on at least 2
occasions since December 2017. 
 
8.      Since
December 2017 the Tenant has not advised the Landlord in writing that the
problem persists, nor has she brought her own Tenant application alleging
disrepair. Instead, the Tenant appears to be of the view that she can refuse to
pay rent and when the Landlord brings an application for arrears, she can
simply raise the mouse issue so as to defeat any attempt to evict her. This
conduct has enabled her to avoid paying rent for a significant period of time
to date. 
 
9.      If
the problem were as serious as the Tenant claims, and if the Landlord actually
did not make efforts to address the problem, the Tenant should have brought her
own application or sought an order from the Board permitting her to engage a
pest control company herself to deal with the problem and deduct the cost from
rent. Instead she did nothing which suggests that the problem is not as serious
as the Tenant claims, and that the underlying objective is to avoid payment of
rent.
 
10.   The
Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
11.   I
am not satisfied, based on the evidence, that the Landlord is in serious breach
of his maintenance obligations pursuant to S. 83(3)(a) of the Act. He has made
numerous attempts to deal with the mouse infestation, which have been thwarted
by the Tenant and her family by their refusal to co-operate. 
 
12.   The
Tenant requested additional time to locate alternate accommodation. She agreed
to pay rent for the month of November 2018 by November 1, 2018 if the eviction
is postponed to November 30, 2018.
 
13.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until November 30,
2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated, as of November 30,
2018. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before November 30,
2018.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application
and, as agreed by her, $1,030.00 for rent for the month of November 2018
 
3.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before November
1, 2018, she will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from November 2, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
 
4.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before November 30, 2018, then starting December
1, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
5.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after December 1,
2018.
