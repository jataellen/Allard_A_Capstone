Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-21151-19
 
 
 
 
MQ (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict JB (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes.
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard in Newmarket on January 22,
2020.
 
The Landlord's Representative, RM,
and the Landlord attended the hearing.
 
 Determinations:
 
1.     
The Landlord’s
representative advised at the outset of the hearing that the Landlord was not
proceeding with the application for termination on the basis of interference
and requested the Board’s consent for the application for that relief be
withdrawn. 
 
2.      I have considered the Landlord’s request for
withdrawal in accordance with subsection 200(4) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 and consent to the withdrawal of the Landlord’s application to terminate
the tenancy for the Tenant’s interference with reasonable enjoyment.
 
3.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from July 15, 2019 to
February 14, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination.
 
4.     
The Tenant is in possession
of the rental unit. 
 
5.     
The monthly rent as of the
date of the hearing is $4,802.50.
 
6.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $4,802.50 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
 
7.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 30, 2019 to January 29,
2020.
 
8.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Landlord’s application
to terminate the tenancy on the basis of the Tenant’s interference with
reasonable enjoyment is withdrawn.
 
2.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before February
9, 2020.
 
3.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $26,294.19*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 29, 2020, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $157.89 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
January 30, 2020 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 9, 2020, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
February 10, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
7.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 9, 2020, then starting February 10, 2020, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 10, 2020.
 
9.     
If, on or before February 9,
2020, the Tenant pays the amount of $33,807.50** to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
10.  
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after February 10, 2020 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
