Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
AGSPM
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict AG
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
(L1 Application)
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because she, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone she permitted in the residential complex has substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another tenant and/or she, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone she permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or
negligently caused undue damage to the premises (N5 Notice); because she or
another occupant of the rental unit has committed an illegal act or has carried
out, or permitted someone to carry out an illegal trade, business or occupation
in the rental unit or the residential complex (N6 Notice); and because she has
been persistently late in paying her rent (N8 Notice).  (L2 Application)
 
These applications were heard in Barrie on September
21, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord’s Legal
Representative, AS, and the Landlord’s Agent, RH, attended the hearing.  CH
appeared as a witness for the Landlord.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
CH testified she works for
the Landlord and helps to property-manage the complex, including the rental
unit.
2.     
CH testified that on
September 12, 2018, she attended the rental unit.  At that time, CH spoke with
the Tenant.  CH stated the Tenant had told her that she was going to attend the
scheduled hearing to present her case.
3.     
AS submitted that the
hearing should proceed on an uncontested basis.  AS stated the Tenant has been
before the Board on other applications, is well aware of the process, and had
indicated to CH that she would be in attendance today.  I agreed and therefore
proceeded to hear the applications on an uncontested basis.
 
L1 Application
 
4.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from July 1, 2018 to
September 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective July 26, 2018.
5.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,528.02 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from February 1, 2018 to July 26, 2018.
 
L2 Application
N8 Notice
7.     
In support of the Landlord’s
claim the Tenant has been persistently late in paying her rent, AS submitted
the Tenant’s ledger (exhibit LL#1) and cited three previous L1 applications
disposed of before the Board in the past three years.
8.     
I find the Tenant has
persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.  I am prepared to
grant the termination of the tenancy as requested by the Landlord, subject to
the findings under the other notices under this L2 application and any section
83 considerations.
N6 Notice
9.     
RH testified that on July
17, 2018, he conducted a routine inspection of the rental unit with a Barrie Fire
Prevention Officer and found the smoke/CO alarm was removed from the ceiling. 
He stated he found the alarm on table belonging to the Tenant.
10.  
RH testified the rental unit
is one of two units on one side of a semi-detached building.  RH stated the
only other alarm that he found in place was in the other unit.
11.  
RH also observed two
black-smoke type marks on the wall and ceiling of the main hallway.
12.  
RH testified the Fire
Prevention Officer confirmed the black-smoke mark on the ceiling was due to
smoke damage, but could not determine the origin of the wall mark.  AS
submitted a number of exhibits as part of RH’s testimony.
13.  
Exhibit LL#2 was submitted,
which is the Tenant’s signed acknowledgment in the original lease respecting
the maintenance of operational smoke/CO detectors.
14.  
Exhibit LL#3 comprises
photos of the alarm that CH testified he found on the Tenant’s table, and the
alarm properly reinstalled after his inspection was completed.  
15.  
Exhibits LL#4 and LL#5 are
copies of the Chief Fire Prevention Officer’s September 17, 2018 email
(confirming a ticket was issued on July 17th against the Tenant) and
of the actual ticket for $360.00 that was issued.
16.  
Exhibit LL#6 contains photos
of the black-smoke marks found by RH on July 17th.
17.  
Exhibit LL#8 comprises
photos from a number of inspections and in respect of the July 17th
inspection, a photo clearly showing an ashtray with fresh looking cigarette
butts.  RH testified that the rental unit is a ‘non-smoking’ unit, as is the
complex.  RH referred to LL#1 to show the Tenant is well aware that the unit is
a ‘non-smoking’ unit.
18.  
RH confirmed that on
September 12, 2018, he conducted a follow-up inspection of the unit and found
the smoke/CO in its proper place and operational.
19.   Based on the uncontested testimony and evidence,
I find the Tenant or an occupant or guest of the Tenant, has committed an
illegal act in the rental unit by disabling and removing the smoke/CO alarm
from its installed place.  Reference is made to the Fire Protection and
Prevention Act, 1997, Ontario Regulation 213/07, subsections 6.3.3.6 and
6.3.3.5(1)(c).
N5 Notice
20.  
RH testified that when the
tenancy began on December 1, 2014, the Tenant inspected the rental unit and
signed-off on a “Rental Unit Condition Report” (exhibit LL#7).  RH confirmed
there were no problems or issues raised in that report.
21.  
RH was asked to go through
photographs in exhibit LL#8, which contained photographs taken at inspections
of the rental unit on December 1, 2014 (when the tenancy began), July 17, 2018,
July 26, 2018 and August 14, 2018.
22.  
RH confirmed that the rental
unit was in very good, clean condition on December 14, 2018.
23.  
For the July 17 and 26, 2018
inspections, RH identified, item by item, the damage to the rental unit that he
had found.  The damaged items he identified are all contained and clearly laid
out in the two N5 notices that had been served on the Tenant (the 1st
N5 was served on July 17, 2018 and the 2nd N5 was served on July 31,
2018).  The first N5 notice identifies an estimated a total of $8,950.00
(including taxes) to repair all of the undue damage. 
24.  
At the hearing, RH
identified two missing kitchen cabinet doors, punctures and damaged areas in
certain walls, a damaged toilet tank, damaged fridge drawers and shelf, missing
screens, soiled/damaged carpet, water damage to kitchen ceiling, rubbish/garbage
on the deck and in the back yard, and clutter throughout the unit including a
partially blocked stairwell.
25.  
For the July 26th
inspection, RH identified some of the effort by the Tenant to roughly patch
over some of the punctured and damage walls, but RH confirmed that the Tenant
did not remedy the first N5 notice within the 7-day voiding period.  For
example, the two kitchen cabinet doors were still missing.
26.  
RH testified that since the
Tenant did move some of the clutter out of the way to make the unit cleaner, he
was able to confirm other undue damage such as damaged bi-fold closet doors and
missing window screens were not repaired.  As well, whatever patchwork the
Tenant had attempted was unsatisfactory as the patches were rough in
appearance.
27.  
For the August 14th
inspection, RH confirmed that one of the two missing kitchen cabinet doors was
re-installed.  RH testified the Tenant had attempted to paint over some of the
patchwork but the paint was not the same colour as the original paint.  
28.  
RH testified that he went
out and secured three quotations for the repair all of the undue damage in the
rental unit, including carpet replacement and painting of the unit.  The three
quotations were submitted as exhibit LL#9.  I noted that all three quotations
by the arms-length companies exceed the $8,950.00 that was quoted in the first
N5 notice and L2 application.  AS confirmed that the Landlord understands this and
is willing to accept the lower dollar amount, as given in the N5 notice.
29.  
Based on the testimony and
evidence provided, I find the Tenant has wilfully or negligently caused damage
to the rental unit and/or the residential complex.  Further, I find the Tenant did
not void the N5 Notice within the seven-day period provided for under
subsection 62(3) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).   
30.  
It is clear to me from the chronology
of events as testified to by RH, and I so find, that the second N5 notice
served on the Tenant is in compliance with the provisions of subsections 68(1)
and (2) of the Act.
31.  
As a result, I find the
Landlord has incurred, or will incur, reasonable costs of $8,950.00 to repair
the damage and/or replace property that was damaged and which could not be
reasonably repaired.
32.  
I made these findings at the
hearing orally and indicated I am willing to grant the termination of the
tenancy on a non-remedial (final) basis.
Final Submissions on Possible Relief from Eviction
33.  
AS requested a non-remedial
termination under the L2 application be tied to the 11-day standard period that
was she requested for the L1 application.  AS argued the testimony and evidence
has shown that the cluttered and damaged state of the unit, along with the
illegal action taken by the Tenant in respect of the disabled smoke alarm,
should warrant such a termination date.
34.  
AS indicated that she is not
aware of any other circumstance that might affect the granting of the remedy
the Landlord is seeking.
 
Section 83
 
35.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
Due
to a potential Canada Post strike, the Landlord must immediately give a copy of
this Order to the Tenant by:
▪  handing it to the Tenant;
▪  handing it to an apparently adult person
in the rental unit;
▪  placing it under the door of the rental
unit or through a mail slot in the door;
▪  leaving it in the Tenant’s mailbox; or, 
▪  if there is no mailbox, leaving it at the
place where mail is ordinarily delivered to the Tenant.
The
Landlord shall not use regular mail, registered mail or courier to
deliver the Order.

the rental unit on or before October 8, 2018.
3.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
