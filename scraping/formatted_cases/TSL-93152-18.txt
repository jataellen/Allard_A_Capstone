Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-93152-18
 










 
 

S.G
(the 'Landlord') applied, to the Landlord and Tenant Board (the “Board”), for
an order to terminate the tenancy and evict F.K and M.K (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on March 26, 2018.
 
The
Landlord was represented by C.B, licensed paralegal. The Tenant, M.K (the
“Tenant”), attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Preliminary Matter(s)
 
1.     
This matter was set to start at 9:30 a.m. When
the matter was called at approximately 11 a.m., the Tenant requested an
adjournment because some of the documentary evidence she wished to present
going to the lawful monthly rent for the unit were only electronically
available on her cell phone in the form of text messages and emails. The Tenant
stated she did not know how, in advance of the hearing, to download the
required documents to present same during the hearing. In particular, the
Tenant stated some of the documentation in her cell phone showed she and the
Landlord had agreed to a rent reduction during the material time. As I stated
during the hearing, I would be interested in having such documents entered into
evidence and I agreed to hold the matter down until 2 p.m. to accord the Tenant
an opportunity to download the documents and make the necessary copies for
presentation during the hearing.
2.     
When the matter reconvened at approximately 2:15
p.m., the Tenant stated she was unable to download and print any documents
stored in her cell phone. I then permitted the Tenant to read out the contents
of the document(s) she alleged went to an agreement between the parties to
reduce the lawful rent. However, the Tenant did so and it was clear there was
no document going to an agreement between the parties in connection with
reducing the lawful rent. The portions of the documents read by the Tenant
dealt with other issues such as the Tenant’s decision to paint part of the unit
and discussions between the Tenant and the Landlord about the Tenant’s wish to
bring in roommates upon the first-named Tenant vacating the unit on November
30, 2017.
3.     
Based on the evidence presented by the Landlord,
and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, I find, on a balance of
probabilities, the lawful monthly rent for the unit during the material time to
be $2,300.00. There was no dispute between the parties the Tenants did not make
any payments to the Landlord after the application was
filed and, as such, the total amount of arrears owing to the Landlord to March
31, 2018 is $6,200.00. 
4.     
During the course of the hearing, the Tenant
raised some issues in relation to the unit. In particular the Tenant stated the
Landlord interfered with her ability to “sublet” the unit or bring in roommates
to assist with the payment of the monthly rent. The Tenant also mentioned
issues of disrepair. The Tenant is within her rights, on an application such as
this, to raise issues pursuant to section 82 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”). However, here, the Tenant
did not have evidence ready to be provided to the Landlord’s representative or
to the Board and had not provided the Landlord’s legal representative, prior to
the hearing, with notice or disclosure in relation to the issue(s) she wished
to raise at the hearing, although she claims to have verbally brought the
issues to the Landlord’s attention in the past.
5.     
It is incumbent parties be prepared on the date
of the hearing. Indeed, the Notice of Hearing, which the Tenant received and
read, states, in part, as follows: 
What
you should bring to the hearing:
You
should be ready to present any evidence you need to support your case. 
Make
sure you bring:
Three
copies of any evidence you wish to use (for example: receipts or pictures). 
If you are
a tenant and you wish to raise any issues that are not in the landlord’s
application (for example: outstanding maintenance or harassment) it is
important that you bring evidence to this hearing to support your claims.
[emphasis added]
6.     
The Notice of Hearing goes on to inform parties
they should be ready to proceed with the hearing and present any evidence they
have to support their case. 
7.     
While I declined to hear the Tenant’s
submissions and evidence with respect to the section 82 issue(s) for the
reasons stated above and in accordance with section 183 of the Act, as I stated
during the hearing, and on more than one occasion, the issues need not go
unheard by the Board as it is open to the Tenant to bring to the Board her own
tenant application(s) concerning any tenant issues, in relation to disrepair in
the unit or otherwise, and she may wish to consult with Tenant Duty Counsel for
assistance in this connection.  
The
Landlord’s Application   
8.     
The Tenants have not paid the total rent they
were required to pay for the period from December 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018. 
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
February 15, 2018.
9.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit of
$2,300.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlord.
10.  
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenants for the period from January 1, 2017 to February 15, 2018.
11.  
The Tenant submitted, on more than one occasion,
she should not be responsible for the entirety of the monthly rent, and current
arrears, as the first-named Tenant vacated the unit on November 30, 2017. The
Tenant also submitted, rather vehemently, she and the first-named tenancy
entered into a joint tenancy with the Landlord
and she and the first-named Tenant are the sole named Tenants on the lease.
12.  
In a joint tenancy, there is a single tenancy agreement and the
tenants are jointly and severally (i.e., together and individually) liable for
the payment of the entire rent for the rental unit. Effectively, this means
that where there is a joint tenancy between two or more tenants and arrears are
owing to the landlord, each tenant can be held liable for the entire arrears
amount.
Section
83 Relief
13.  
Having considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), I find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
14.  
I say this because, while the Landlord’s legal
representative requested a standard order, I asked the Tenant if she required
more time to void my order, below, or to find new accommodation, and the Tenant
testified, on several occasions, she has found a new place to live, effective
April 1, 2018 and wishes to vacate the unit on March 31, 2018.. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenants void the order as set out
below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The
Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before April 7, 2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$3,419.34*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to
March 27, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$75.62 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting March 28, 2018
to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before April 7, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe
interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from April 8, 2018 at 3.00%
annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated on or before April 7,
2018, then starting April 8, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord, on or after April 8, 2018.
8.     
If the Tenants wish to void this order and
continue the tenancy, they must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $6,375.00 if the payment is made on or before March 31, 2018, or
ii)       $8,675.00 if the payment is made on or before April 7, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by
the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after April 8, 2018 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make
this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
