N.A.R.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict M.A.
and J.H. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard in Whitby on February 9, 2018.
 
Only
the Landlord attended
the hearing. The Landlord was represented by M.A..
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from November 1, 2017 to February 28, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective November 27, 2017.
2.      The
lawful monthly rent decreased effective January 1, 2018 to $1,437.97.
3.      The
Tenants paid $500.00 after the application was filed.
4.      The
Landlord credited the Tenants’ account with $57.33 for interest in their
deposit up to January 31, 2018.
5.      The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending February 28, 2018 total $3,333.55.
6.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,447.52 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Landlord is unaware of any circumstances that
would justify refusing or delaying eviction.
It is
ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before February 23, 2018.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $999.18*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 12, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $47.28 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 13, 2018 to the date they move out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
February 23, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from February 24, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 23, 2018, then starting February
24, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 24,
2018.
8.      If,
on or before February 23, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $3,508.55** to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. 
This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could
remain in the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after February 24, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to
the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
