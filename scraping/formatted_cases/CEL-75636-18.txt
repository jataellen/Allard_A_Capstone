Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
 











 
 

NF (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict KK and SB (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay
the rent that the Tenants owe.  (L1 Application)
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenants because:  the Tenants, another occupant of
the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully caused undue damage to the premises; the
Tenants, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the
residential complex have used the rental unit or the
residential complex in a manner that is inconsistent with use as a residential
premises and that has caused or can be expected to cause significant damage;
and the Tenants, another occupant of the rental unit or a person the Tenants
permitted in the residential complex have seriously impaired the safety of any
person. The Landlord has also applied for an
order requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the damage; and
because. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after the termination date.  (L2 Application)
 
These applications were heard in Mississauga on June
1, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord and the Landlord’s
Legal Representative, BG, attended the hearing.   The Landlord indicated she
had spoken with the Tenants on May 31st, reminding them of the
hearing on June 1st.  I proceeded to hear the merits of the applications
on an uncontested basis.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 Application
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent they were required to pay for the period from December 1, 2017
to June 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective March 25, 2018.
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $725.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from August 6, 2016 to March 25, 2018.
4.     
The Tenants paid $920.00
after the application was filed.
5.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
L2 Application
6.     
The Landlord served the
Tenants with an N7 notice effectively on April 12, 2018.   The notice clearly
identifies that the Landlord is seeking the immediate termination of the
tenancy because of complaints of the Tenants fighting, screaming, smoking, drug
usage and making undue noise on February 15, 2018, March 22, 2018 and April 5
& 12, 2018, as well as complaints from the next door neighbour that a
Tenants’ friend broke into their garage and car, and stole items from them.
7.     
The L2 application claims
wilful damage in the amount of $355.00 in respect of undue damage to the front
door and ceiling above it, and a window screen.
8.     
The N7 notice specified a
termination date of April 24, 2018, which represents 10 days of time, and
satisfies the notice requirements of subsections 63(1) and 66(2) of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).
9.     
BG explained that the rental
unit is one of three basement units, while the main floor unit is rented by the
Landlord on an AirBnB basis.
10.  
It became evident from the
Landlord’s submissions that the claim of “inconsistent with use as a
residential premises” would not be substantiated or proven on a balance of
probabilities.   I indicated I would deny this claim, and the Landlord
acquiesced on this point. 
11.  
NF provided her testimony on
all the claims.  To corroborate NF’s testimony, BG submitted the following
exhibits:
•       
LL#1 and LL#4:  a copy a
text message from a “R” who was to rent the main floor unit that on April 12, 2018,
the Tenants and their friends were banging on the door below at 11:00 pm and
that they “were wasted on drugs”;
•       
LL#2: a copy of a May 31,
2018 letter from another basement tenant, to confirm the Tenants’ friend was
causing undue banging noises on April 4, 2018 late at night and on April 5,
2018 early in the morning, when the friend brought many garbage bags and boxes
stuffed with “random” items;
•       
LL#3, a copy of a May 31,
2018 letter written by the next door neighbour who affirms that on April 5,
2018, one of the Tenants’ friends broke into their garage, broke into their car
and stole various items.  The Tenants’ friend was apprehended by the police and
the neighbour’s items were stored at the side of the rental unit.
•       
LL#5 – photos taken in March
to May 2018 to evidence the undue damage caused to the rental unit door and
ceiling above it, and the window screen; and
•       
LL#6 – a copy of an estimate
to repair the undue damage, for $355.00 plus HST.
12.  
NF was unable to provide any
testimony or other evidence as to how the Tenants or their permitted guests
seriously impaired the safety of another person in the rental unit or in the
residential building.
13.  
With respect to the damage
to the rental unit door (a hole) and the ceiling (a hole), NF speculated that
the Tenants either punched or kicked the door and ceiling, or were carrying an
object which they would have used to hit the door and ceiling.   When I asked
further, NF had no first-hand knowledge or any second-person account as to how
the door and ceiling were damaged, or by whom.  Based on this, I was unable to
determine on a balance of probabilities that first, the Tenants or their
permitted guests caused the damage, and second, whether the damage was caused
through negligence or by wilful behaviour.  As such, I indicated the Landlord
failed to persuade me on this particular claim of undue damage.
14.  
However, with regard to the
window screen, NF’s testimony and photographs were sufficient to persuade me
that the Tenants or their permitted guests wilfully damaged the screen. 
Specifically, the Tenants ran an extension cord/cable from the rental unit out
through the screened window, so that they could recharge the battery to their
e-scooter.  In this case, I believe that on a balance of probabilities, the
Tenants wilfully cut through the screen to allow a cable to pass through it. 
For this claim, I will grant the Landlord the $50.00 plus HST she is seeking
for the repair of the screen, as quoted in LL#6, which I find to be a
reasonable repair amount. 
15.  
In summary, there was no
evidence or testimony provided by the Landlord to support the Landlord’s claim
that any serious impairment to someone’s safety had occurred or that any wilful
damage had been done by the Tenants or their permitted guests.  While a friend
of the Tenants was caught for theft by the police, the act of his theft did not
impair anyone’s safety which is the threshold to be reached under this
application.
16.  
Pursuant to subsection 66(1)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’):  
“A landlord may give a tenant notice of termination of the
tenancy if,  (a) an act or omission of the tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the tenant
seriously impairs or has seriously impaired the safety of any person; and  (b)
the act or omission occurs in the residential complex.”
17.  
I am not satisfied that the
Tenants’ actions would support a finding that they have seriously impaired the
safety of another person.
18.  
Subsection 66(1) of the Act
does not state that any possibility or risk of harm or impairment of safety is
sufficient to justify termination.  Rather the subsection uses the qualifier
“serious”.  Given that the Tenants’ noise and even smoking habits may have
interfered with the tenants upstairs or in the basement unit, I find that the
claims in of themselves are not sufficient to meet the test of “serious
impairment of safety”.  As a result, this portion of the Landlord’s application
shall be dismissed.
19.  
The Landlord provided no
testimony or evidence to support the claim of wilful damage in the application,
other than for the window screen which I am granting the Landlord.  However, I
will not order non-remedial eviction for this discrete damage.
20.  
Finally, the Landlord
provided no testimony or evidence to support the claim of inconsistent use in
the application, and this third portion of the application is dismissed.
21.  
I made these determinations
orally at the hearing to those present.
 
It is ordered that:
 
L1 Application
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before June 25,
2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $1,749.29*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to June 14, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $30.41 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting June 15, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 25, 2018, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June
26, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 25, 2018, then starting June 26, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 26, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before June 25,
2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $1,310.00** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after June 26, 2018
but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
L2 Application
10.  
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $56.50 (i.e. $50.00 plus 13% HST), which represents the reasonable
costs of repairing the damage or replacing the damaged property in the rental
unit.
11.  
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount of $56.50 owing on or before June 25, 2018, they
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June
26, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
