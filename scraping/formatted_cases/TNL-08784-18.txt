Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-08784-18



 


 


 



 
 
KGL (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict CD (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The
Landlord also claimed administration charges related to NSF cheques.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on October 18, 2018.
 
Only
the Landlord’s Representative, VF, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent he was required to pay for the period from August 1, 2018 to October
31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective August 24, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant is in possession
of the rental unit. 
3.     
The monthly rent as of the
date of the hearing is $1,577.90.      
4.     
The Tenant has made no
payments since the application was filed. 
5.     
The Landlord incurred
charges of $60.00 for administration charges related to cheques tendered by or
on behalf of the Tenant, which were returned NSF.
6.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,571.79 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
7.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from December 1, 2017 to August 24, 2018.
8.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It
is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Landlord, upon receipt
of this order, must give a copy of this order to the Tenant by a method set out
in subsection 191 (1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, other than
sending it by mail or courier to the last known address where the Tenant
resides or carries on business.
 
2.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before November
5, 2018.
3.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $2,929.11*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to October 25, 2018 and the total charges related to NSF cheques tendered to
the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant, less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $51.88 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
October 26, 2018 to the date he moves out of the unit.
5.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
6.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before November 5, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
November 6, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
7.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before November 5, 2018, then starting November 6, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
8.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after November 6, 2018.
9.     
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, he must pay to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust:
i)        $4,983.70 if the payment is made on or before October 31, 2018, or
ii)       $6,561.60 if the payment is made on or before November 5, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
10.  
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after November 6, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
