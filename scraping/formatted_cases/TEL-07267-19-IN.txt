INTERIM ORDER 
 
A.B. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict D.C. (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord
requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation (the ‘N12’); and because the number of persons living in the rental
unit is more than is permitted by law, and because the Tenant, another occupant
of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or a lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant, and wilfully or
negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the
unit after the termination date as well as NSF cheque charges.
 
This application came before the Board in Toronto on
January 29, 2020.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
For the reasons that follow,
the Landlord’s application for an eviction order is dismissed. 
2.   
The application brought
pursuant to section 89 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’) for compensation for wilful or negligent damage is adjourned to a date
to be set by the Board. 
The
Landlord’s N12 Notice of Termination
3.   
The Landlord’s application
for an eviction order is based in part on a notice of termination in Form N12
issued pursuant to s. 48 of the Act. The date of termination on that notice is
November 30, 2019. 
4.   
Pursuant to s. 48.1 a
landlord who serves notice of termination under section 48 must give to the
tenant compensation equal to one month’s rent or offer to the tenant another
rental unit acceptable to the tenant. 
5.   
The Landlord’s application
here says the Landlord will give the compensation to the Tenant in the future. At
the hearing the Landlord indicated that the Tenant was not in arrears for the
period ending November 30, 2019 and that she would give the Tenant the
compensation right away. 
6.   
As I explained at the
hearing, that is not an option available to the Landlord. Pursuant to s. 55.1
the compensation is payable no later than the date of termination on the notice.
As the date of termination on the Landlord’s notice is November 30, 2019, that
means she had until November 30, 2019 to make payment. Subsection 83(4) says
the Board is barred from issuing an eviction order where compensation has not
been paid as required. 
7.   
As a result, the Board has
no jurisdiction to issue an eviction order based on the Landlord’s N12 notice
of termination and that part of the application must be dismissed.
The
Landlord’s N5 Notice of Termination
8.   
The Landlord’s N5 notice of
termination is invalid on its face. 
9.   
It purports to be a second
notice of termination pursuant to s. 68 for substantial interference, negligent
and wilful damage, and overcrowding but the Landlord acknowledges no first N5
was served. In other words, the requirements of s. 68(1)(a) have not been met.
10. But the same N5 also purports to be a first
notice of termination for negligent or wilful damage and overcrowding pursuant
to ss. 62 and 67 of the Act. The primary problem with the N5 being a first N5
is that both ss. 62 and 67 require a landlord to give a minimum of 20 days’
notice. Here, the Landlord says she mailed the notice to the Tenant on December
3, 2019. Pursuant to s. 191(3) a notice given by mail is deemed to have been
given five days after mailing. In this instance that would mean service
occurred on December 8, 2019. As the date of termination on the notice is
December 24, 2019, this means the Landlord failed to give the mandatory minimum
of 20 days’ notice for a first N5.
11. So the Landlord’s N5 is invalid on its face. The
Board has no jurisdiction to evict a tenant based on an invalid notice, so this
part of the application must also be dismissed.
Daily
Compensation and NSF Fees 
12. Dismissal of the Landlord’s eviction application
also means the Board has no jurisdiction to order daily compensation or NSF
fees. There must be a valid termination notice before the Board can award those
amounts. So those claims are also dismissed. 
The
Section 89 Claim for Compensation 
13. The Landlord’s application for compensation for
damage to the residential complex is adjourned to a date to be set by the
Board. The Landlord failed to bring three copies of her evidence with her to
the hearing and I ran out of time to deal with that part of the application. 
14. Please note that at the present time all Board
hearings are being conducted by telephone. So contrary to what was stated at
the hearing, the parties will be required to file their evidence with the Board
prior to the hearing in addition to serving it on the opposing party. Please
see the order below for the respective deadlines. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.   
The Landlord’s application
for an eviction order is dismissed.
2.   
The Landlord’s request for
an order for daily compensation is denied. 
3.   
The Landlord’s request for
an order requiring the Tenant to pay NSF charges is dismissed without
prejudice.
4.   
The Landlord’s application
under s. 89(1) of the Act for an order for compensation due to negligent or
wilful damage is adjourned to a date to be set by the Board. 
5.   
No later than two weeks
prior to the hearing, the Landlord shall serve on the Tenant and file with the
Board any photographs, receipts, documents, recordings or like thing the
Landlord intends to rely on at the hearing. 
6.   
No later than one week prior
to the hearing, the Tenant shall serve on the Landlord and file with the Board
any photographs, receipts, documents, recordings or like thing the Tenant
intends to rely on at the hearing. 
7.   
The Board’s preferred method
of service on the Board is by e-mail. The Board’s e-mail is TE-ltb@ontario.ca.
