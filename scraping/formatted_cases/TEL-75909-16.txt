Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-75909-16
 










 
 
 

M.F.L.
(M.), L. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict D.K. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on January 25, 2017.
 
The Landlord’s representative, I.M., and the Tenant attended the
hearing. 
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent she was required to pay for the period from
March 1, 2016 to January 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination effective October 28, 2016.
2.     
The arrears of rent owing for the
period ending January 31, 2017, total $4,997.05.
3.     
The Landlord incurred costs as a
result of filing the application in the amount of $170.00 and is entitled to
reimbursement for those costs. 
4.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $994.13 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2016
to October 28, 2016, in the amount of $16.46.
6.      The
Tenant paid $1,051.40 after the application was filed.
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until March 31, 217, pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
8.      The
Tenant says that she suffered a stroke in November 15, 2015, which meant that
she was unable to speak, was paralysed on her right side and was away from work
for an extended period of time. 
9.      The
Tenant says that her condition has been improving recently and she was able to
increase her working hours in December 2016. 
10.   The
Tenant says that she has lived in the rental unit with her husband for 10 years
and would like an opportunity to pay off the arrears in the form of a payment
plan that would see her pay an additional $500.00 per month over the next 10
months. 
11.   The
Tenant says that, once she is back to full time hours, she makes $1,700.00.
However, her husband works seasonal, part-time work and his income is not
reliable. The monthly rent is $994.13.
12.   The
Tenant provided no medical evidence to support her claim that she had suffered
a stroke. She also failed to provide any evidence to support her claim that her
condition is improving and she is able to return to full time employment. She
also failed to produce any pay stubs or other document to confirm her
suggestion that she makes $1,700.00 from her work. 
13.   In
the alternative, if a payment plan is not feasible, the Tenant says that she
needs an additional 4 months to find a new place to live. 
14.   The
Landlord says that neither the payment plan or a delay of 4 months are
reasonable options. The Landlord says that the Tenant has not made any partial
payments towards the arrears since October and this means that she is not
likely capable of paying an additional $500.00 per month. 
15.   Based
on the evidence before me, I am not satisfied that the Tenant can adhere to the
payment plan she is suggesting. However, I am satisfied that she likely
suffered from a severe medical condition which will affect her ability to find
alternate accommodations. Finally, as I recognize that this is a long-term
tenancy but the arrears are already significant, I find that it would not be
unfair to delay this eviction until March 31, 2017. 
It
is ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before March 31, 2017.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4,088.44*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to February 7, 2017, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $32.68 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 8, 2017 to the date she moves out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $170.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
February 18, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from February 19, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before March 31, 2017, then starting April 1,
2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 1, 2017.
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, she must pay to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $5,991.18 if the payment is made on or before February 28, 2017, or
ii)       $6,985.31 if the payment is made on or before March 31, 2017**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after April 1, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
