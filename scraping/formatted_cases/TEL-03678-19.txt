Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-03678-19
 











 
 
 

Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict N T and M A G (the 'Tenants') because they have been
persistently late in paying their rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation
for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on September 20,
2019.
 
The Landlord, the second-named
Tenant above, and the sister and agent of the first-named Tenant above, L G,
attended the hearing. The Landlord was represented by S H. 
 
As a result
of a Superior Court of Justice order suspending the enforcement of LTB eviction
orders during the period from March 19, 2020 to July 31, 2020, the issuance of
this Order has been delayed. Any payments made by the Tenant(s) to the Landlord
after the application was filed by the Landlord must deducted from the amount
ordered by the Board. 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
There is no dispute here
that the Tenants have persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was
due.
2.     
According to the Landlord’s
ledger for the period August, 2018 to April, 2019 the Tenants were late paying
the rent each month but by the end of the month they were either caught up or
mostly caught up. But then in May of 2019 the Tenants started to fall behind.
They did not catch up and reach a zero balance until close to the end of
August, 2019 at which point they paid $3,644.09. That lump sum payment brought
them to a zero balance and discontinued the Landlord’s most recent L1
application (contained in Board file TEL-03671-19). 
3.     
The dispute between the
parties here is the Tenants’ request for relief from eviction pursuant to s. 83
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). They ask for an
opportunity to save the tenancy subject to the requirement rent be paid on time
into the future. The Landlord opposes that request and asks for a standard
eviction order. 
4.     
That means the issue for the
Board is whether or not it would be unfair in all of the circumstances to grant
the Tenants the relief sought. 
5.     
This tenancy began in 2014. There
are an unknown number of adults and children living in the rental unit. The
children attend school nearby.
6.     
There have been three L1
applications for non-payment of rent, all of which have resulted in the Tenants
paying everything outstanding before an eviction order could issue.
TEL-75865-16 was discontinued effective February 13, 2017. TEL-78535-17 was
discontinued April 19, 2017. The most recent one was discontinued August 22,
2019. 
7.     
This is the first
application alleging persistent late payment of rent. The notice of termination
was served on the Tenants August 9, 2019. As stated above, the Tenants cleared
the arrears on or about August 22, 2019. As of the date of hearing nothing had
been paid for the month of September, so the rent for September 2019, was also
not paid on time.
8.     
In response to my questions,
the Tenants say that they did not realise that persistent late payment of rent
could get them evicted. They have monthly income of around $5,000.00 a month
which should be more than sufficient to pay rent on time and in full but the
Tenants have other debts and there is an affordability issue. As of the date of
hearing the monthly rent was $1,658.61. Things worsened in the spring of 2019 because
the second-named Tenant above became ill and had to have surgery. They have not
paid September’s rent on time because they used all of their resources to pay
off the arrears in August, 2019. They want to catch up with September’s rent
and pay rent on time starting October 1, 2019. None of the Tenants’ evidence
was corroborated by documentation.   
9.     
The problem with the
Tenants’ request for relief from eviction is that the only measure by which the
Board can analyse their promises to pay in the future is their behaviour in the
past. 
10.  
The Tenants do not deny
having a multi-year history of paying rent late; they do not deny knowing when
rent is due; they do not deny prioritizing other debts over paying rent. They
claim they did not know being persistently late could result in eviction but
they did in fact know that sometime in the first half of August of 2019 because
the Landlord served notice of termination on them for persistent late payment. Despite
considerable income they did not pay rent on time for September, 2019 and
continued to be in arrears as of the date of hearing. It is something of a
mystery as to where their income is going. 
11.  
In other words, the evidence
supports the conclusion it is more likely than not that the Tenants will
continue to pay rent late into the future. They have an affordability issue. As
a result, granting relief in the form requested would be unfair to the Landlord
as the Landlord will inevitably have to bring additional legal proceedings to
the Board with respect to this tenancy. 
12.  
In the alternative, the
Tenants ask that eviction be delayed until December 31, 2019. Given the delays
in writing and issuing this order, the Tenants have essentially gained the
delay they requested. No further delay is justifiable. 
13.  
As a result of all of the
above, the Board’s standard order shall issue. 
14.  
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,658.61 from the Tenants and this deposit shall be applied to
any outstanding daily compensation owing to the Landlord.
15.  
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2019 to October 31, 2019
totalling $24.87. This amount shall also be offset against the daily
compensation owing. 
16.  
The Landlord incurred costs
of $175.00 for filing the application and is entitled to reimbursement of those
costs.
17.  
This order contains all of
the reasons for the decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.
It is ordered that:
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenants is terminated effective October 31, 2019 for
persistent late payment of rent. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit
on or before August 15, 2020.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $13,475.86 (less any payment made to the Landlord after the hearing
held on September 20, 2019 for the period commencing November 1, 2019), which
represents compensation for the use of the unit from November 1, 2019 to August
4, 2020, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit. 
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $54.53 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from
August 5, 2020 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing on or before August 15, 2020, they will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from August 16,
2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before August 15, 2020, then starting August 16, 2020, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after August 16, 2020.
