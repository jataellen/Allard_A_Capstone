Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-94351-18










 

P.P.L.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict H.A
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on May 15, 2018.
 
The
Landlord’s legal representative, S.K, and the Tenant attended the hearing.
            
Determinations:
 
            L1 application
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from March 1, 2018 to May 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective March 27, 2018.
2.      The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
3.      The monthly rent as of the date of the hearing is $1,359.09.
4.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,359.09 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 1,
2017 to March 27, 2018.
6.      The
Tenant paid $2,080.00 after the application was filed.
7.      The Tenant
acknowledges the arrears and testified that she has made arrangements to pay
the arrears.  She testified that she is in receipt of OW and supplements the
balance of the rent with money she receives from the child tax benefits, but
that those monies do not come until the 20th of each month, which
caused her to fall behind.  
8.      The Tenant
testified that she has lived in the unit since September, 2016 and lives there
with three daughters, ages 2, 13, and 15.  She testified she is connected to
the community, her children go to the neighbourhood school, and have friends in
the area.
9.      The Tenant
requested that she be given an extended time to pay the arrears and be able to
maintain the tenancy.  
10.   The
Landlord submitted that there should be a standard order on the L1
application.  
11.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until June 15,
2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
            L2
application
12.   At the hearing, the Landlord testified that the Tenant had
persistently paid the rent late since August 2017 and had also persistently
paid late in a period from 2015 to 2017.  
13.   The Tenant
also acknowledges that she has been persistently late with her rent, because of
the timing of the child tax benefits and her other financial pressures.  She is
making arrangements with her brother in order to get caught up and be able to
bridge the payments so as to be on time with her rent in the future.
14.   The
Landlord submitted there should be termination on the basis that the Tenant has
been persistently late with her rent.
15.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it
would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1)
of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
            L1
application
 
1.      Unless the
Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and
the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before June 15, 2018.
2.      The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord $192.43*, which represents the amount of rent owing
and compensation up to May 23, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $44.68 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting May 24, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.      The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.      If the
Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 15,
2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from June 16, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If the
unit is not vacated on or before June 15, 2018, then starting June 16, 2018,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 16, 2018.
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $2,079.54 if the payment is made on or before May 31, 2018, or
ii)       $3,438.63 if the payment is made on or before June 15, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after June 16, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
L2
application
1.      If the
Tenant voids the eviction order for arrears of rent above, the Tenant shall
also pay the Landlord monthly rent owing on or before the first day of each
month commencing June 1, 2018 and continuing thereafter until and including May
1, 2019.
2.      If the
Tenant fails to make any of the payments in paragraph ten above, the Landlord
may apply under section 78 of the Act, within 30 days of the breach and without
notice to the Tenant, for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenant.
