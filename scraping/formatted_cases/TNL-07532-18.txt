            Order
under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-07532-18



 


 


 



 
 
RL
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict DM and
JM (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe and because the Tenants have been persistently late in paying their rent.
 
This
application was heard in Newmarket on September 19, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from May 1, 2018 to September 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination.
2.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $950.00 from the Tenants and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
3.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2018
to October 2, 2018.
4.      The
Tenants have been persistently late in paying the rent.  I have reviewed the
Tenants’ payment history as set out in the N8 Notice, which shows that the
Tenants have been consistently late with rental payments and that there has
been a pattern of later and later payments in more recent months.  
 
5.      The
Landlord indicated at the hearing that if the Tenants void the order pertaining
to termination of the tenancy for non-payment of rent, the Landlord is willing
to allow the Tenants an opportunity to continue the tenancy if they pay their
rent in full and on time going forward.
 
6.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before October 13, 2018.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $284.21*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to October 2, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $31.79 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting October 3, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before October
13, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from October 14, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before October 13, 2018, then starting October
14, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after October 14,
2018.
8.      If,
on or before October 13, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $2,340.50** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after October 14, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
10.   If
the Tenants void the part of this eviction order further to paragraph 8 of this
order then commencing on November 1, 2018 and continuing to October 1, 2019 the
Tenants shall pay the monthly rent in full on or before the first business day
of each month.
11.  
Section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 applies
to this order. If the Tenants fail to make any payment set out in paragraph 10
above, the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenants, apply to the Board for
an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. In the application
the Landlord may request an order for new arrears and NSF charges.  The
Landlord must make this application no later than 30 days after the Tenants
fail to make a payment.
