Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-88781-18
 










 
 

A.K
and K.D.R.P. (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict S.S. and M.B. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the
rent that the Tenants owe and because the Tenants have been persistently late
in paying their rent.
 
This
application was heard in Lindsay on March 19, 2018.
 
Only the personally named Landlord and the Landlord’s
representative, A.H., attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
THE APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from January 1, 2018 to March 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlords
served a Notice of Termination effective February 18, 2018.
2.      The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending March 31, 2018, total $2,240.00.
3.      The
Landlord incurred costs as a result of filing the application in the amount of
$190.00 and is entitled to reimbursement for those costs. 
4.      The
Landlords collected a rent deposit of $1,130.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlords.
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from August 21, 2016
to February 18, 2018, in the amount of $27.08.
THE
APPLICATION FOR PERSISTENTLY LATE PAYMENT
6.      The
Tenants have been persistently late in paying their rent. According to the
information provided by the Landlord, the Tenants have paid their rent late 15
out of 15 times since January 2017. 
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). In
particular, I have considered the Landlord’s request that, if the Tenants are
able to pay all of the outstanding arrears and void the portion of the
application regarding non-payment of rent, the Tenants must pay their rent on
time for a 12 month period subject to the Landlord’s right to file an
application to terminate the tenancy in the event of a breach. Based on the
Landlord’s request, I find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from
eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. 
It
is ordered that:
THE
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before April 1, 2018.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $643.28*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to March 21, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $37.15 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting March 22, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before April
1, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from April 2, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 1, 2018, then starting April 2,
2018, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after April 2, 2018.
8.      If
the Tenants wish to void this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to
the Landlords or to the Board in trust:
i)        $2,430.00 if the payment is made on or before March 31, 2018, or
ii)       $3,560.00 if the payment is made on or before April 1, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after April 2, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlords. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
THE
APPLICATION FOR PERSISTENTLY LATE PAYMENT
10.   If the
Tenants void the eviction order for non-payment of rent pursuant to paragraphs
8 or 9 above then the Tenants shall pay to the Landlord new rent on time and in
full for the period commencing April 1, 2018, to March 31, 2019.  
11.   If the
Tenants fail to make any one of the payments in accordance with paragraph 10 of
this order the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenants, apply to the Board
pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and
evicting the Tenants and requiring that the Tenant pays any new arrears, NSF
fees and related charges that became owing after March 31, 2018.
