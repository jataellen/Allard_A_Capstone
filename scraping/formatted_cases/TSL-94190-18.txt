Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-94190-18
 











 
 

R.C (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict D.W (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes.
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant has persistently paid his
rent late. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
The applications were heard in Toronto on May 2, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The parties are in agreement that the tenancy
began on August 1, 2012 and the current rent is $750.00 per month which is due
on the first day of each month.  The rental unit is a self-contained apartment
unit in a multi-unit complex with 9 units.  
L-1
2.     
The Landlord alleged that the Tenant has not
paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from March 1,
2018 to May 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective March 27, 2018.
3.     
The Tenant does not dispute that he has not paid
rent for the months of March, April and May of 2018, and his arrears are now
$2,250.00.  
S.82
4.     
The Tenant also raised issues about the
Landlord’s failure to maintain which resulted in substantial interference of
his enjoyment of the rental unit and depriving him of vital services.
5.     
The Tenant testified that the winter heating has
been inadequate since the first winter in 2018, and that the lighting in the
common area hallway is insufficient during the day time as it is on a timer.  He
has raised these issues with the Landlord since he moved in and up to now the
Landlord has not addressed them.
6.     
The Tenant acknowledged that he has never filed
any Tenant’s application with the Board regarding these issues.  The Landlord testified
that there is no heating issue and submitted a letter signed by three other
tenants in the same building on January 10, 2018, indicating that their
apartments were warm enough to be comfortable.  According to the Landlord, the
three tenants occupy the units above, below and next door to the Tenant’s unit
and share the same heating system and temperature setting.
7.     
The Landlord further testified that the hallway
lighting is on a timer and will go off during daylight hours.  According to the
Landlord, there is no reason for the hallway lights to be on during those hours
as there is sufficient natural light in the area.  The Landlord also testified
that he attends the building three times a week to check on the common areas,
including the lighting in the hallway, and would replace any defective light
bulbs. 
8.     
On balance, I find the Landlord’s evidence to be
more persuasive and there is insufficient evidence to support the Tenant’s
claim of the maintenance issues cited.
9.     
The Tenant also acknowledged that he has only had
sporadic work since February 2018 and cannot afford the rent at this rental
unit.
10.  
I also find that, on a balance of probabilities,
the Tenant did not pay rent for the months of March, April and May because he did
not have sufficient income to support that rent, and not because of the
maintenance issues he cited.
11.  
The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $700.00
from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
12.  
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenant for the period from December 2, 2017 to March 27, 2018.
L2
13.  
The Landlord also alleged that the Tenant has
been persistently late in his payment of rent.  The due date is the first day
of each month.
14.  
The Landlord’s testimony, which is not disputed
by the Tenant, is that the Tenant was late in his payment of the full rent for
each month for the months of February, March, June, and September in 2017, as
well as January and February 2018, and has not paid any rent for March, April
and May of 2018.
15.  
I am satisfied that, on a balance of
probabilities, the Tenant has been persistently late in his payment of rent.
S. 83
16.  
The Tenant testified that he lives alone and has
sporadic work at this time.  He has indicated that he does not have the
necessary income to support his rent at this point in time.  He has also
indicated that he is planning to vacate and terminate the tenancy as of May 13,
2018.
17.  
I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The issues raised by the Tenant under s.82 of
the Act are dismissed.
2.     
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out
below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The
Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before May 15, 2018.
3.     
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $898.83*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to May 4, 2018,
less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $24.66
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting May 5, 2018 to the
date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
5.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
6.     
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before May 15, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe
interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from May 16, 2018 at 3.00%
annually on the balance outstanding.
7.     
If the unit is not vacated on or before May 15,
2018, then starting May 16, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord, on or after May 16, 2018.
9.     
If, on or before May 15, 2018, the Tenant pays
the amount of $2,440.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy would not be terminated
and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this payment is not made in full
and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
10.  
If the Tenant pays the amount of $2,440.00** to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust, the tenancy is still terminated as of
May 31, 2018.  The Tenant must move out of the unit on or before May 31, 2018.
11.  
If the unit is not vacated on or before May 31,
2018, then starting June 1, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
12.  
Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord, on or after June 1, 2018.
