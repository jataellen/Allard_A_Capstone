Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-19786-19











 
 

IMH (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict (SB) and (KL) (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on January 9,
2020.  
 
The Landlord’s representative, CB
and the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from August 1,
2019 to January 31, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice
of Termination effective August 28, 2019.
2.     
The monthly rent as of the
date of the hearing is $2,306.00.
3.     
The Tenants paid $3,306.00
after the application was filed.
4.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $2,306.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from May 16, 2019 to August 28, 2019.
6.     
There was no dispute that
the Tenants owe $8,903.00, which represents the arrears of rent of January 31,
2020 and the application filling fee.
7.     
The Tenants moved into the
unit in June 2019. 
8.     
The Tenants say that they
fell into arrears when Tenant, KL could not work due to a hand injury he
sustained during a fire in the unit. Tenant SB testified that September 2019
rent was not paid because it depends on when she gets paid. Also, they had
other expenses to pay, not just the rent. Some of their expenses are on
automatic withdrawals. 
9.     
SB has been working full
time and has a monthly income of $2,400.00, which could increase depending on
whether she works a different shift.  SB also stated that they had to take a
loan when they made the payment of $2,306.00 in October 2019.
10.  
The Tenants expect that KL
will be getting funds from EI, but could not say exactly when that will occur. 
11.  
The Tenants requested relief
and proposed a plan that would have the arrears paid in 9 payments, and would
be paid in full in a few months. The Landlord opposed the payment plan and
submitted that this is a short tenancy and the Tenants do not have the means to
sustain the tenancy based on their income and their expenses. 
12.  
I considered the Tenants’
payment plan, and do not find that it is reasonable that the Landlord has to
wait for 9 payments until the arrears are paid in full, considering that the
Tenants had funds and chose to pay other expenses before they paid the rent. The
Tenants are in substantial arrears of over $8,000.00 and have not paid any
amount towards the rent in over 3 months, even though SB has been working full
time. I also considered that even before KL stopped working, the Tenant did not
pay the full rent for August 2019. I find it more likely than not that the
Tenants currently do not have the means to sustain this tenancy. 
13.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenants
indicated they could move out by January 31, 2020.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenants void the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before January
31, 2020.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $5,689.29*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to January 20, 2020, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $75.81 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting January 21, 2020 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 31, 2020, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
February 1, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2020, then starting February 1, 2020, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 1, 2020.
8.     
If, on or before January 31,
2020, the Tenants pay the amount of $8,903.00** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after February 1,
2020 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
