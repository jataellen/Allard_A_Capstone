Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: SOL-88977-17











 
 

OC (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict JM (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
  
This application was heard in St.
Catharines on April 12, 2018.  The Landlord
representative, JC, and the Tenant attended the hearing.  At the hearing the
Tenant raised maintenance issues pursuant to section 82 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from December 1, 2017
to April 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective December 19, 2017.
2.     
The Tenant remains in the
rental unit.  The monthly rent is $1,300.00.  She did not dispute that she has
not paid the rent claimed.  She advised that she withheld the rent in response
to maintenance issues, some of which were resolved, but some of which were not,
and she has the money to pay.
3.     
As I stated at the hearing,
there is no legal justification for withholding rent.  If there are lingering
maintenance issues, and the Landlord does not address them, the Tenant may
apply for relief in a T6 application.  I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until April 30, 2018, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of
the Act.
4.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,300.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.  Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the
period from June 1, 2017 to December 19, 2017.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before April 30,
2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $4,587.32*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to April 17, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $42.74 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
April 18, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before April 30, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from May
1, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before April 30, 2018, then starting May 1, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 1, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before April 30,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $6,690.00** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after May 1, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
10.   The Tenant shall provide a written list of any
remaining maintenance issues in the rental unit to the Landlord by April 19,
2018.
11.   The Landlord shall inspect the rental unit for
rats, and any other maintenance issues, by April 30, 2018, and shall take
remedial action, including professional pest control, within a reasonable time.
12.   If the Landlord does not take remedial action
within a reasonable time, the Tenant may apply for relief in a T6 application.
