Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-78805-17
 










 
 
 

J.X.C.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict S.D.
and M.P. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.  This is an L1 application.
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenants because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they
permitted in the residential complex have wilfully or negligently caused undue
damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring
the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the damage. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.  This is an L2 application.
 
This
combined application was heard in Toronto on April 21, 2017.  The Landlord and the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
At the hearing, the Landlord requested the consent of the Board to
withdraw their L2 application.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay
for the period from March 1, 2017 to April 30, 2017.  Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective March 16, 2017.  The
Tenants did not dispute the amount of the arrears of rent.
2.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,850.00 from the
Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
3.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the
period from June 15, 2016 to March 16, 2017.
4.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance
with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.  There were no circumstances provided by the
parties that would require me to delay or deny the eviction.
5.    
In accordance with subsection 200(4) of the Act, I consent to the
withdrawal of the L2 application.
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out
of the rental unit on or before May 8, 2017.
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $1,656.69*, which represents
the amount of rent owing and compensation up to April 27, 2017, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $60.82 per day for
compensation for the use of the unit starting April 28, 2017 to the date they
move out of the unit.
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of
filing the application.
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on
or before May 8, 2017, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be
simple interest calculated from May 9, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.    
If the unit is not vacated on or before May 8, 2017, then starting
May 9, 2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
May 9, 2017.
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue the tenancy,
they must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)       $3,890.00 if the payment is made on or before April 30, 2017, or
ii)      $5,740.00 if the payment is made on or before May 8, 2017**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that
subsection on or after May 9, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant
possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
10. 
The L2 application is withdrawn.
