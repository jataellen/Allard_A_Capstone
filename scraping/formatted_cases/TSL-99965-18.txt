Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-99965-18
 










 
 

M.C
and F.C (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict R.G (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes. (L1 application)
 
The
Landlords also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the
Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises. The Landlords has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlords for the damage; and because
the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted
in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlords or another
tenant. The Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date. (L2 application)
 
This
combined application was heard in Toronto on November 2, 2018.
 
Only the Landlords attended
the hearing.
 
I was satisfied that the Notice of Hearing was properly served on
the parties and there was no adjournment request or any other indication that
the Tenant could not attend the hearing.
 
The hearing was scheduled for 9:30 AM. I waited until 11:20 AM and
proceeded to hear the matter without the Tenant in attendance.
 
Determinations:
 
            L1 application
 
1.      Based
on the uncontested evidence of the Landlords, I am satisfied as to the
following.
2.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from May 1, 2018 to November 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective September 15, 2018.
3.      The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
4.      The monthly rent as of the date of the hearing is $876.18.
5.      The
Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
6.      The
Landlords collected a rent deposit of $780.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
7.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 17, 2009
to September 15, 2018.
L2
application
8.      Based
on the Landlords’ uncontested evidence, I am satisfied that the Tenant’s behaviour
did substantially interfere with other tenants’ reasonable enjoyment of the
residential complex with complaints of loud noisy arguments coming from the
Tenant’s unit at 4:00 AM on August 28, 2018.
9.      However,
the Landlords also confirmed that this behaviour had ceased during the voiding
period and thus this part of the N5 Notice has been voided. 
10.   I
am also satisfied that, on a balance of probabilities, the Tenant or someone
visiting or living with the Tenant has wilfully or negligently damaged the property,
in that the Landlords found the door frame of the Tenant’s unit was found to be
damaged on August 27, 2018.
11.   The
Landlords will incur costs of $175.00 to repair the damage and/or replace
property that was damaged and cannot be reasonably repaired.
12.   It
is also the Landlords’ uncontested evidence that the Tenant has not repaired
the damaged property or paid the Landlord the estimate to repair the damaged
property.
13.   As
such, this part of the N5 Notice has not been voided.
Section
83 considerations
14.   The
Tenant did not attend the hearing and there was no evidence before me as to any
section 83 considerations.
15.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
            L1 application
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before December 1, 2018.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $1,483.95*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to November 20, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $28.81 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting November 21, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before
December 1, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from December 2, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before December 1, 2018, then starting December
2, 2018, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after December 2,
2018.
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlords or to the Board in trust:
i)        $2,880.50 if the payment is made on or before November 30, 2018, or
ii)       $3,756.68 if the payment is made on or before December 1, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after December 2, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlords. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
L2
application
10.   Even
if the Tenant voids the L1 application for arrears of rent above, the tenancy
between the Landlords and the Tenant is still terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before December 1, 2018.
11.   The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $175.00, which represents the reasonable
costs of repairing the damage damaged property.
12.   If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount owing on or before
December 1, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from December 2, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
13.   If
the unit is not vacated on or before December 1, 2018, then starting December
2, 2018, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
14.   Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after December 2,
2018.
15.   Due
to a potential Canada Post strike, the Landlord must immediately give a copy of
this Order to the Tenant by: handing it to the Tenant; handing it to an
apparently adult person in the rental unit; leaving it in the Tenant’s mailbox;
or, if there is no mailbox, leaving it at the place where mail is ordinarily
delivered to the Tenant; or placing a copy of the order under the door of the
rental unit or through a mail slot in the door. 
16.    
The Landlord shall not use regular mail, registered mail,
Xpresspost or any courier service that is used by Canada Post to deliver the
Order.
