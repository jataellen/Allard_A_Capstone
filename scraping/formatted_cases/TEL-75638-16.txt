Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-75638-16
 










 
 
 

M.L.M.I.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict M.W.
and D.C. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on January 25, 2017.
 
The Landlord’s representative, R.A., and the first-named Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from November 1, 2016 to January 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective November 22, 2016.
2.     
The arrears of rent owing for the period ending January 31, 2017, total
$3,508.75.
 
3.     
The Landlord incurred costs as a result of filing the application
in the amount of $170.00 and is entitled to reimbursement for those costs. 
 
4.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,177.60 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2016
to November 22, 2016, in the amount of $21.09.
6.      The
Tenants paid $23.45 after the application was filed.
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until May 7, 2017, pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
8.      The
Tenant’s circumstances in this matter are very difficult. The first-named
Tenant says that the second-named Tenant has not lived in the rental unit for
some time. The Tenant is 7 months pregnant and lives in the rental unit with
her 4 year old son who attends school and daycare in the neighbourhood. The
Tenant is expecting to give birth at some point in March 2017. 
9.      The
Tenant could not really explain why she has fallen into arrears. She says that
she was robbed in December, but that incident did not explain why she had
fallen into arrears in November. The Tenant says that she was injured at work
and has been making less income. However, even on her modified salary and
including her tax benefit and other business income, the Tenant still makes
$3,268.00. Based on this income, the Tenant should be able to afford the
monthly rent of $1,177.60. The Tenant simply had no explanation for how she has
found herself with so much outstanding rent. 
10.   The
Tenant is seeking relief from eviction in the form of a payment plan that would
see her pay off the outstanding arrears in approximately 12 months. She says
she has no family to assist her and no other place to live. 
11.   The
Landlord’s representative is not agreeable to such a lengthy payment plan and
she says that the Landlord has filed approximately 11 applications with the
Board during this 3 year tenancy. The Landlord is seeking a standard eviction
order which would see the Tenant evicted within 11 days of the date of this
order. In the alternative, the Landlord says that, if the Board does implement
a payment plan, the plan should not exceed 3 months. 
12.   Based on
all the circumstances, I am satisfied that the Tenant should be given an
opportunity to save this tenancy, but it would be unfair to the Landlord to
grant the Tenant’s request for a 12 month payment plan. As a result, I find
that it would not be unfair to postpone this eviction until May 7, 2017, which
should give the Tenant ample opportunity to pay the outstanding arrears and
stay in the rental unit. An order will issue accordingly. 
It
is ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before May 7, 2017.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $2,300.68*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to January 30, 2017, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $38.72 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting January 31, 2017 to the date they move out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $170.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
February 10, 2017, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from February 11, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before May 7, 2017, then starting May 8, 2017,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 8, 2017.
8.      If
the Tenants wish to void this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $3,678.75 if the payment is made on or before January 31, 2017, or
ii)       $8,389.15 if the payment is made on or before May 7, 2017**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after May 8, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
