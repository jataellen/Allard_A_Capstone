Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-80773-17
 










 
 
 

Mu.K. and
Me.K. (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
S.B. (the 'Tenant') because the Landlords require the rental unit for residential
purposes and because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The
Landlords also claimed administration charges related to NSF cheques.
 
This
application was heard in Whitby on June 30, 2017.
 
Only
the second-named Landlords above attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
THE
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from April 8, 2017 to July 7, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective May 28, 2017.
2.      The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending July 7, 2017 total $4,188.00.
3.      The
Landlords incurred costs of $190.00 for filing the application and are entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
4.      The
Landlords
are also entitled to $20.00 to reimburse the Landlords
for charges the Landlords incurred as a result of a cheque tendered by or on behalf
of the Tenant which was returned NSF.
5.      The
Landlords
collected a rent deposit of $1,800.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
6.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 9, 2016 to
May 28, 2017 totalling $30.78.
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Landlords are unaware of any circumstances
that would justify granting relief to the Tenant. 
THE
APPLICATION FOR LANDLORD’S OWN USE
8.      The
Landlords’ application for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenant based on the assertion that they require the rental unit for residential
purposes must be dismissed. The notice of termination served on the Tenant does
not meet the mandatory requirements of the Act.
9.      Subsection
48(2) of the Act says:
The date for termination
specified in the notice shall be at least 60 days after the notice is given and
shall be the day a period of the tenancy ends or, where the tenancy is for a
fixed term, the end of the term.  
10.   This
provision means that a notice of termination for landlord’s own use must
provide a date of termination that is the last day of the period of the
tenancy. 
11.   Here
the period of the tenancy is monthly and runs from the 8th day of
the month to the 7th day of the following month. This means the date
of termination on the notice must be at least 60 days after the notice is given
and fall on the 7th day of the month. The date of termination on the
Landlords’ notice is July 31, 2017.
12.   As
a result, the notice fails to meet the mandatory requirements of the Act and
that part of the application that is based on it must be dismissed. 
It is
ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of
the rental unit on or before July 16, 2017.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $2,268.80*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to July 5, 2017
and the total charges related to a NSF cheque tendered to the Landlords by or on behalf of the Tenant, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owes on the rent
deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $59.18
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting July 6, 2017 to the
date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $190.00
for the cost of filing the application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing* on or before July 16, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe
interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from July 17, 2017 at 2.00%
annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before July 16, 2017, then starting July 17,
2017, the Landlords
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 17, 2017.
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlords
or to the Board in trust:
i)        $4,398.00 if the payment is made on or before July 7, 2017, or
ii)       $6,198.00 if the payment is made on or before July 16, 2017**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after July 17, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords.
The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once
during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
