Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-90634-18
 











 
 
 

L. Y. and H. L. (the 'Landlords') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict M. Z. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did
not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.  This is an L1 application.
 
The Landlords
also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because
he, another occupant of the rental unit or someone he permitted in the
residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlords or another tenant; and
because the Tenant has been persistently late paying the rent. The Landlords
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after
the termination date.  This is an L2 application.
At the hearing the Tenant applied pursuant to section
82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') for an order
determining that the Landlords or the Landlord's superintendent or the
Landlord's agent substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenant or by a member of the
Tenant's household. 
 
This application was heard in Toronto on May 29, 2018.
 
The first-named Landlord, the
Landlord’s representative, Q. J. X., and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent he was required to pay for the period from March 1, 2018 to May 31,
2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination
effective April 24, 2018.
2.    
The Landlords collected a
rent deposit of $1,100.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlords.
3.    
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 24, 2017 to April 24, 2018.
4.    
The Tenant said he did not
agree with the amount outstanding and provided copies of Email Money Transfers
(‘EMT’) made April and May 2018.  The Tenant did not dispute owing the March
2018 rent.
5.    
The Landlords said they did
not receive the EMT or else they would have accepted the transfer.  The
Landlords also stated they believed the screen shots provided by the Tenant are
not real and/or have been doctored.  I cannot tell if this is true or not;
however, I am satisfied the Landlords did not accept the EMTs.
6.    
The Tenant also submitted a
copy of an email from the Landlords saying notice has been given to the Tenant
that he has to move by March 30, 2018.  On the other hand, the Tenant is
willing to make a repayment plan for the full outstanding amount.
7.    
I cannot decipher whether
the Tenant has paid the rent he claims by EMT and the Landlords did not accept
it, or the Tenant has paid and the Landlords did not receive the email, or the
Tenant did not pay the amount as the Landlords claim.  
8.    
At the hearing, the Tenant
stated he could pay $2,200.00 for June 1, rent when it is due on June 15 and
$1,290.00 on June 20, 2018.  Taking these payments into consideration the
Tenant would have all arrears paid by June 20, 2018.  With this order the
Tenant has an additional number of days to pay the amount outstanding.  For
this reason, I find the most appropriate solution is to grant the Tenant time
to pay the amount outstanding arrears of rent within 11 days of this order.  
9.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
APPLICATION FOR PERSISTENTLY LATE RENT
10.  The Tenant has been
persistently late paying the rent, which is due on the 15th day of
each month.  While the Tenant disagreed with the dates the Landlords submitted
the Landlords provided copies of the EMTs received from the Tenant and the
dates correspond to those payments.
11.  It is clear the Tenant has not paid the rent on the 15th
of the month for the last year.  The Tenant argued that he waited to pay
because the Landlords were reimbursing him for payment he made for a hood range
for the stove; however, based on the Tenant’s own receipt from the purchase, he
knew the cost of the reimbursement on February 10, five days prior to rent
being due.
12.  I am satisfied the Tenant has been persistently late paying his rent
and a pay on time order shall issue.
13.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. 
APPLICATION FOR SUBSTANTIAL INTERFERENCE
14.  At
the hearing, the Landlord requested the consent of the Board to withdraw their
application for substantial interference of reasonable enjoyment.
15.  In
accordance with subsection 200(4) of the Act, I consent to the withdrawal of this
application.
TENANT’S SECTION 82 APPLICATION
16.  The Tenant claims that Landlords have imposed landlord type duties
on him when he should not be put in that position.  For instance, the Landlords
wanted him to wait around for a contractor to install the stove, and wanted him
to purchase the hood range for the stove.  Now the Landlords want him to
supervise the fixing of the dishwasher.
17.  The Tenant told the Landlords in March 2018 that these types of
issues were the responsibility of the landlord, but the Landlords have
continued to ask the Tenant to perform the duties.  The Landlords did not deny
this and admitted to telling the Tenant to do these things.  In April 2018 the
Landlords told the Tenant to assist with the fridge repair.  The first-named
Landlord stated that he did not believe it was unreasonable and the Tenant
should do these activities.  
18.  The fact is that the Tenant did perform these duties for the
Landlords, but terminated that understanding when he told the Landlords they
were to complete them.  As of that time, the Landlords had no right to impose
on the Tenant with any landlord related obligations.  
19.  Given the inconvenience the Tenant has expressed he has gone through
purchasing items for the Landlords, being present to orchestrate repairs, and
my knowledge of similar applications, I find a reasonable abatement of rent to
be $200.00.  This is based on the Landlords’ continued behaviour after the
Tenant told them to cease.
20.  This order contains all of the reasons for the
decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $4,390.00 for arrears of rent up to July 14, 2018, plus costs, and
less abatement of rent.
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord the amount set out above in paragraph 1 in on or before July 6, 2018. 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay
the monthly rent on or before the fifteenth day of every month beginning July
15, 2018 until June 15, 2019.
4.    
If the Tenant fails to make
any one of the payments in accordance with this order, the outstanding balance
of any arrears of rent and costs to be paid by the Tenant to the Landlord
pursuant to paragraph 1 of this order shall become immediately due and owing
and the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to the Board pursuant
to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenant and requiring that the Tenant pay any new arrears, NSF fees and related
charges that became owing after July 14, 2018.
