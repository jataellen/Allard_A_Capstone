Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-89565-18
 











 
 
 

A.D. I. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict B. W. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes (L1 application).
 
A.D. I. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict B. W. (the 'Tenant') as the Tenant’s behavior
or someone living with or visiting the Tenant has substantially interfered with
another Tenant’s or the Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment of the residential
complex (L2 application).
 
This application was heard in Whitby on April 30,
2018.
 
Only the Landlord’s representative,
C. A., attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 application
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the total
rent he was required to pay for the period from June 1, 2017 to April 30,
2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective March 13, 2018.
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,350.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 1, 2017 to March 13, 2018.
4.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
L2 application
1.     
On February 27, 2018 the
Tenant was served with a first Notice of Termination under section 64 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2016 (the ‘Act’) with a termination date of March 19, 2018. This
notice was not voided because the Tenant and the Tenant’s guests contined to
yell, scream, slam doors and swear during the nights and days that followed the
notice. . ..
2.     
The Notice provides a log of
dates and times of disturbing yelling, screaming, banging and swearing
emanating from the Tenant’s rental unit. Overall there are 16 complaints from
other tenants in the building dating back to September 2017, and two official
complaint letters from the City of Oshawa By-Law enforcement unit dated
September 2017 and February 2018.
3.     
Based on the uncontested
evidence before the Board, I am satisfied the Tenant has substantially
interfered with the other tenants' reasonable enjoyment of the residential
complex and substantially interferes with a lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlord by making loud and disturbing noise in the rental unit on a
frequent basis.  The tenancy is terminated for the reasons that follow.
4.     
The Landlord brought three
witnesses to the hearing however due to time constraints only one witness
testified. The Landlord confirmed that each witness experienced the same
interference with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential premises.
5.     
Amy Ifurung, a tenant’s unit
is very close to the Tenant’s unit, testified at the hearing. She moved into her
rental unit in June 2017. From September 2017 onwards, she experienced frequent
loud screaming and arguments between the Tenant and a female visitor. The language
was abusive and disturbing and was occurring frequently at all hours of the
night and during the day.
6.     
This was so frequent and
concerning that the witness filed a complaint with the city of Oshawa. The
first complaint was filed in September 2017 and the second noise complaint with
the city was filed in January 2017. A third complaint was made to the city of
Oshawa in April 2017. All complaints were documented and the Landlord has
provided the letters from the city of Oshawa, Municipal Law Enforcement and
Licensing Services in support of the application.
7.     
The witness testified to
living in the rental unit with her 12 year old son. They are both unable to
sleep due to the frequent nightly disturbances and the witness, who does shift
work, testified that even during the day the fighting is so loud that she is
unable to rest in between shifts. She has contacted the police on two occasions
as they were afraid for their safety, and for the safety of the female who was
screaming inside the rental unit.
8.     
The Landlord also provided
emails and had recordings made by other Tenants of the disturbances. One of the
tenants, wrote about having to leave the rental unit with her young son as the
fighting was causing him great anxiety. The tenant writes of banging of doors
and screaming, where she believed that someone had been locked in a closet.
Numerous other testimonials are contained in the Landlord’s disclosure package
providing details of the noise and the detrimental impact on them.
9.     
The Landlord requested
termination of the tenancy.
10.  I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before May 25, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $9,107.44*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to May 14, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $44.38 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
May 15, 2018 to the date he moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May 25, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from May 26,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before May 25, 2018, then starting May 26, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 26, 2018.
