Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-62437-17
 










 
 
 

H.C.
and C.P. (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict T.B. and L.B. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent
that the Tenants owe.  This is an L1 application.
 
The
Landlords applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants because
they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the
residential complex have wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the
premises. The Landlords has also applied for an order requiring the Tenants to
compensate the Landlords for the damage.  This is an L2 application.
 
This
application was heard in Belleville on March 16, 2017.
 
The Landlords, the Landlords’ representative, S.P., and the
Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
L1
APPLICATION
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from September 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective December 22, 2016.
2.      The
Landlords collected a rent deposit of $1,150.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlords.
3.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from July 1, 2016 to
December 22, 2016.
4.      The
Tenants agreed they owed $1,520.00 in arrears of rent to March 31, 2017 and
costs.  
5.      The
Tenants currently have an application before the Board EAT-61608-16.  This will
be heard at a later date.  
6.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find
that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act. 
L2
APPLICATION
7.      The
Landlords claimed the Tenants broke a bedroom window on the second floor.  The
first-named Landlord submitted a picture of the broken window.  The window has
two panes of glass and the outside pane was broken.  The first-named Landlord
stated she believed the Tenants broke the window because the window was not
broken until after the Tenants moved in.  
8.      The
Tenants stated they did not know the window was broken.  They have a curtain in
the window and since the broken pane is on the outside they did not come into
contact with it.  The Tenants further stated that the first-named Tenant deals
with installing windows for a living and he would not have left the window
broken had he known of it.
9.      On
any application before the Board the person making an allegation bears the
burden of proof.  This means the Landlords must lead sufficient evidence to
establish that the Tenants broke the window.  Here, the Landlords are basing
their allegation on assumption only which means the Landlords have failed to
meet their burden of proof.  As a result, no remedy will issue.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $1,520.00 for arrears of rent to March 31,
2017 and costs.
2.     The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlords the amount set out above in paragraph 1 and
new rent in accordance with the following schedule:
a)    $1,300.00
on or before April 1, 2017 (April 2017 rent);
b)    $380.00
on or before April 20, 2017;
c)    $1,300.00
on or before May 1, 2017 (May 2017 rent);
d)    $380.00
on or before May 20, 2017;
e)    $1,300.00
on or before June 1, 2017 (June 2017 rent);
f)     $380.00
on or before June 20, 2017;
g)    $1,300.00
on or before July 1, 2017 (July 2017 rent); and
h)   $380.00
on or before July 20, 2017.
3.     If
the Tenants fail to make any one of the payments in accordance with this order,
the outstanding balance of any arrears of rent and costs to be paid by the
Tenants to the Landlord pursuant to paragraph 1 of this order shall become
immediately due and owing and the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenants,
apply to the Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating
the tenancy and evicting the Tenants and requiring that the Tenants pay any new
arrears, NSF fees and related charges that became owing after March 31, 2017.
