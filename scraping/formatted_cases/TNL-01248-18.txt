Order
under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-01248-18



 
 


 


 



SPI
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict AA
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (‘L1
application’), and because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying his
rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date (‘L2 application’).
 
This
combined application was heard in Toronto on February 1, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s legal representative, KL, and the Tenant’s
authorized representative, (‘NC’), who is the spouse of the Tenant and is also
an occupant of the unit, attended the hearing.
 
It is determined that:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from December 1, 2017 to February 28, 2018. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination.  Neither the existence nor the amount
of the arrears is disputed by the Tenant. The arrears to the end of February,
2018 currently total $3,575.00.  The total amount owing is $3,765.00, which
includes the application filing fee of $190.00.
 
2.     
The evidence discloses that is a monthly tenancy, that rent is due
on the first day of each month, and that the Tenant has not paid the full rent
when due in 5 of the 6 months during the period from August, 2017 to January,
2018.  I am satisfied that the Tenant has been persistently late in the payment
of rent, and this is not disputed by the Tenant.
 
3.     
The Tenant proposed a payment plan under which the arrears would
be paid by a payment of $800.00 on February 2, 2018 (the day after the hearing)
and monthly payments of $800.00 each on the 20th of each month
beginning on February 20, 2018 and continuing until the arrears are paid in
full.  In addition, the monthly rent would be paid in full and on time for the
12 month period from March 1, 2018 until February 1, 2019.
4.     
While the Landlord did not oppose the granting of an order in
connection with the L2 application for persistent late payment requiring the
ongoing rent on time for a 12 month period, the Landlord opposed the payment
plan proposed by the Tenant in relation to the L1 application for unpaid rent. 
The Landlord submitted that this is a very short-term tenancy that only began
in August, 2017, that almost no rent has been paid for December, January, and
February, and that the plan is over too long a period of time and is therefore
unfair to the Landlord.  The Landlord requested a standard termination order
that would give the Tenant 11 days to void the order by paying the full amount
that is due. 
 
5.     
The Tenant’s representative, NC, testified that the Tenant had not
been working since November but began working at a full-time job within the
past 10 to 14 days.  In addition, NC, who is the spouse of the Tenant and is an
occupant of the unit, also started working at a full-time job about 2 to 3
weeks before the hearing.  They live in the rental unit with NC’s two young
children and state that, because of their new jobs, they can afford to comply
with the proposed payment plan and to pay their rent on time going forward.  NC
provided the Landlord’s legal representative with some documentation verifying
her income from her new job, but did not have any documentation at the hearing
verifying the Tenant’s new job or his income from that job.
 
6.      While
there is merit in the submissions made on behalf of the Landlord, as I
indicated at the hearing, I am satisfied that, in the circumstances of this
case, the payment plan proposed by the Tenant is reasonable and fair.  The
Tenant experienced problems paying the rent because neither he nor NC was
working from November, 2017 until recently, but it appears that this problem
has now been resolved because both the Tenant and NC have started new full-time
jobs that, based upon the testimony of NC, provide sufficient income to enable
them to meet the payment plan and pay their rent on time.  Payment was late in
the first few months of the tenancy even before the Tenant lost his job, but
was late in those months by only a few days and was then paid in full.   Although
the payment plan is over a somewhat lengthy period in relation to the short
duration of the tenancy, it provides for immediate payments this month that
will see the arrears reduced significantly and it will be apparent quickly if
the plan cannot be met.  The Tenant should be given an opportunity to preserve
the tenancy, but only if he complies with the conditions set out in this order.
7.      In
order to balance the interests of the Landlord, section 78 of the Act will
apply so that, if the Tenant fails to make any of the payments set out below,
the Landlord will be entitled to apply to the Board, within 30 days of default
and without further notice to the Tenant, to terminate the tenancy and evict
the Tenant and collect any new arrears.
8.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the
conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of
the Act.
 
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $3,765.00.  This amount
includes the Tenant’s rent arrears for the period ending February 28, 2018 ($3,575.00),
and the $190.00 Board filing fee.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay the amount set out in paragraph 1 according to the following
schedule:
 
(a)  $800.00
on or February 2, 2018;
 
(b)  $800.00 no
later than the 20th day of every month for the period from February
to April, 2018, both inclusive; and
 
(c)  $565.00
on or before May 20, 2018.
 
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord the full monthly rent no
later than the first day of every month for the period from March, 2018 to
February, 2019, both inclusive.
 
4.     
If the Tenant fails to make any of the payments in accordance with
this order, the outstanding balance of any arrears of rent and costs to be paid
by the Tenant to the Landlord pursuant to paragraph 1 of this order shall
become immediately due and owing and the Landlord may, without notice to the
Tenant apply to the Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order
terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant and requiring that the Tenant
pay any new arrears, NSF fees and related charges that became owing after February
1, 2018.
