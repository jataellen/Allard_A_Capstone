Order under Sections 69 and 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 










 
 

SM
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict CD
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
(L1 Application)
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the
Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage; and because the
Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in
the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another
tenant.  The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date. (L2 Application)
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant entered into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.  (L3
Application)
 
These
applications were heard in Mississauga on July 21, 2017.
 
Only the Landlord attended the hearing.  BB signed in as a witness
for the Landlord but was not called forward to testify.  I waited until 10:45
am before calling this matter forward to be heard on an uncontested basis.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 Application
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from March 15, 2017 to August 14, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective June 8, 2017.
2.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,850.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
3.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from October 22, 2016
to June 8, 2017.
L2
Application
4.      The
Landlord requested that the replacement/repair claims made for damages in the
L2 application be withdrawn.  As this does not prejudice the Tenant, I
consented to the withdrawal of these particular claims, thereby narrowing the
scope of the application.
5.      The
Landlord testified that the Tenant is responsible to pay the water/wastewater
bills under the tenancy and presented exhibit LL#1 in support.  LL#1 is a copy
of the Tenant’s own signed agreement with the Region of Peel to assume
responsibility for the water/wastewater bills of the rental unit.
6.      The
Landlord submitted exhibit LL#2 to evidence the three bills to date that the
Landlord has had pursued to pay in the Tenant’s stead, which amount to a total
of $281.74.
7.      I
find that the failure of the Tenant to pay the water/wastewater bills as agreed
to for the tenancy substantially interferes with a lawful right, privilege or
interest of the Landlord.
8.      The Landlord
requested that the Board order the Tenant to pay the unpaid utility charges
pursuant to the L2 application, filed under section 69 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).  However, section 69 of the Act only
permits the Board to issue eviction orders and does not give the Board the
authority to also award unpaid utility charges.
 
9.      Further,
while not claimed by the Landlord, unpaid utility charges cannot be awarded as
“damages” under section 89 of the Act as that section only allows the Board to
require a tenant to compensate a landlord for damage caused to property in the
rental unit or the residential complex.   
 
10.   While the Landlord
has also filed an L1 application for rent arrears, unpaid utilities do not
constitute rent arrears and cannot be awarded in an L1 order.  This is
consistent with Landlord and Tenant Board Interpretation Guideline 11- “Eviction
for Failure to Pay Rent”, which provides as follows in relation to utility
charges:
“The
landlord cannot include amounts for which the tenant fails to reimburse the
landlord for the utility charge in an application for the payment of rent
arrears or in an application for termination of the tenancy and eviction of the
tenant based on the tenant's failure to pay the utility charge.”
 
11.   Consequently, the
Board lacks the authority to order payment by the Tenant of unpaid utility
charges under this L2 application.   Unpaid utility amounts may be a debt owing
to the Landlord that may be recovered by the Landlord in the courts. 
 
12.   With regard to
eviction, however, the Landlord did not press for eviction because of the
unpaid water/wastewater bills, and preferred to rely upon the remedy being
sought under the L3 application.  As such, I am granting relief from eviction
under this L2 application.
 
L3
Application
13.   The
Landlord made reference to the copy of the signed N11 “Agreement to End the
Tenancy” that is appended to the L3 application that was filed with the Board.
14.   The
Landlord testified her boyfriend met with the Tenant on May 25, 2017, and
through a friendly discussion that led to a mutual agreement, the Landlord and
Tenant ended up signing the N11 as described above.
15.   Based
on the uncontested testimony and signed N11, I find the Landlord and Tenant
duly signed an N11 “Agreement to End the Tenancy”, effectively terminating the
tenancy as of August 31, 2017.  
Section
83 / Relief From Eviction
16.   In
respect of the L1 and L3 applications, I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before August 14, 2017.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,458.91*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to August 3, 2017, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $60.82 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting August 4, 2017 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before August
14, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from August 15, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before August 14, 2017, then starting August 15,
2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after August 15,
2017.
8.      If,
on or before August 14, 2017, the Tenant pays the amount of $4,140.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after August 15, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
10.   Even
if the Tenant is successful in voiding the L1 portion of this order pursuant to
paragraphs 8 and 9 above, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated in a final way as of August 31, 2017.
11.   The
Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before August 31, 2017.
12.   If
the unit is not vacated on or before August 31, 2017, then starting September
1, 2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
13.   Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after September 1,
2017.
