Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006










 

WK (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict PM (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Mississauga on May 23,
2018.
 
The Landlord's Agent, WK and the
Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Preliminary Issue:
 
The application was amended on
consent to correct the name of the Landlord to CCC and LS who are the named
Landlords on the written tenancy agreement.  
 
At the hearing the Tenant raised
the following issues pursuant to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'): 
a)   
Light fixtures;
b)   
Weak water pressure in
shower;
c)   
Floors unfinished;
d)   
Entry door lock
e)   
Basement entry hatch.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from November 1, 2017
to May 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of
Termination effective April 11, 2018.
2.     
The monthly rent is
$1,200.00.  The tenancy commenced as of October 1, 2017.
Readiness for occupancy clause
3.     
The Tenant drafted the
tenancy agreement which was entered into on September 28, 2017.
4.     
The Tenant relies on a
clause in the tenancy agreement subtitled “readiness for occupancy” for the
position that his obligation to pay rent is fully discounted because the
Landlords have failed to comply with all nine conditions in this clause.
5.     
It is an established principle in our common law
that ambiguities in a contract that affect the substantial rights and
obligations of a party will be construed in favour of the party who did not
draft the document (contra proferentem).  This
general principle of construing
ambiguities in a document against its
drafter reflects the notion of comparative responsibility. Because the drafter could have avoided the
ambiguous language, of the two parties, the drafter should bear the adverse construction (Conroy
v. Jalaie 2010 ONSC 3626 at para. 19).
6.     
An apparent ambiguity in a word in a contract does
not require immediate resort to the contra proferentem rule. It is
necessary to examine the contract in its entirety considering the context and
purpose (Can. (A.G.) v. Chomcy 2002 CanLII
21639 ONCA (paras. 13 and 14).
7.     
Section 4 of the Act states that a provision in
a tenancy agreement that is inconsistent with this Act is void.
8.     
I am not satisfied that the readiness for
occupancy clause in the tenancy agreement is enforceable.
9.     
The rental unit is a log cabin.
10.  
Some of the clauses in the readiness for occupancy
are ambiguous and unclear.  The clause requiring “all rooms to have minimal
light fixtures” is vague because minimal light fixtures is not clearly defined.
The clause regarding the basement entrance is contradictory.  It states that
this entrance is to both be replaced and repaired. Some of the clauses are
statements and do not indicate that any work is required.  Specifically, “all
plumbing and septic to be in full working order”, chimney and flu pipe to be in
full working order”, “all exterior doors to be in full working order with locks
and keys” and “roof and shingles to be in good condition and not in need of
repair or replacement”. 
11.  
The occupancy clause is incomplete because it
does not set out any method by which the completion of the listed conditions
will be determined.  
12.  
As a consequence and after examining the
contract as a whole including the context, the Tenant bears responsibility for
ambiguities and vagueness in the readiness for occupancy clause.
13.  
The Tenant has been able to live in the unit
since the tenancy commenced.  To accept the Tenant’s position that he is
entitled to live in the unit rent free unless all of the conditions listed in
the readiness for occupancy clause are complete leads to an unfair outcome. 
Some of the clauses are merely statements which do not specify work required
and some of the clauses are ambiguous. 
14.  
Furthermore, the Act sets out the
responsibilities and obligations for both landlords and tenants.  Section 20
requires a landlord to provide a unit in a good state of repair and in
compliance with health, safety, housing and maintenance standards. 
Interpreting the readiness for occupancy clause as proposed by the Tenant is
inconsistent with the Act and disregards the purpose of the Act which includes
“to balance the rights and responsibilities of residential landlords and
tenants and to provide for the adjudication of disputes for other process to
informally resolve disputes”.  
 
Section 82 issues
15.  
The Tenant’s claim regarding
repair required to light fixtures is dismissed.  The Tenant testified that the
wires connecting the light fixtures in the unit are not placed behind the
walls.  He did not provide any photos or any evidence of housing or maintenance
standards that were contravened given that the unit is a log cabin. The
Landlord's Agent testified that wiring is only placed underneath the log
structure when the cabin is constructed because tampering with the logs
post-construction affects the structural integrity.
16.  
The Tenant testified that
there is insufficient water pressure in the shower tap. He did not provide
evidence that he reported this issue to the Landlord. The Landlord's Agent said
he was willing to check the water pressure.  The Landlord breached its
obligation under section 20 by failing to provide adequate water pressure in
the bathroom shower.  As I am not satisfied the Tenant reported this issue to
the Landlord, it is not appropriate to order an abatement.
17.  
The Tenant’s claim that the
floors in the unit require repair is dismissed. The Tenant’s evidence does not
demonstrate that the flooring is “sub-floor”.  The video displayed by the
Tenant displayed plank wood flooring which appeared to be painted.  I did not
observe any repair required although some of the video was quite dark.  The
Tenant’s evidence is consistent with the testimony from the Landlord's Agent
that the floor has been repainted.
18.  
I am not satisfied that any
repair is required to the entry door.  The Tenant said he could lock the door
but it is difficult to open.  The Landlord's Agent said he is willing to
inspect the door.
19.  
The Landlord breached
section 20 of the Act by failing to provide the basement hatch in a good state
of repair.  It is undisputed that the hinge to the hatch requires repair.  The
impact to the Tenant is minimal and it is not appropriate to order an
abatement.
20.  
The Tenant’s request for
compensation regarding an agreement he had with the Landlord to do work in the
unit is not considered in this order. Section 30 of the Act requires a finding
that the Landlord breached section 20 of the Act to authorize any costs for
repair to be paid to the Tenant. 
Relief from eviction
21.  
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,200.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
22.  
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 28, 2017 to April 11,
2018.
23.  
The Tenant requested six
months to repay any arrears owed.  The Landlord's Agent said the Landlord was
willing to delay termination for 90 days.
24.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until August 31, 2018
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.  There are substantial arrears
owed.  However, the delay allows the Tenant time to arrange to repay the
arrears or to make arrangements to move.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before August
31, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $7,431.57*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to June 6, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $39.45 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
June 5, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 15, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June 16,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before August 31, 2018, then starting September 1, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after September 1, 2018.
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $9,775.00 if the payment is made on or before June 30, 2018, or
ii)       $12,175.00 if the payment is made on or before August 31, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after September 1, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
 
Section 82
10.  The Landlord shall inspect and provide any
repair required to the water pressure in the shower tap and the basement hatch
on or before June 30, 2018.
