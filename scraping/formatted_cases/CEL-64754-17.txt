Order under Sections 69 and 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-64754-17
 










 
 
 

S.A. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict M.S. (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes and
because the Tenant gave a notice to terminate the tenancy.
 
This
application was heard in Burlington on March 24, 2017.
 
Only
the Landlord attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
THE
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from January 1, 2017 to March 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective February 16, 2017.
2.      The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending March 31, 2017 total $2,370.00.
3.      The
Landlord incurred costs of $190.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
4.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $790.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 8,
2016 to February 16, 2017 totalling $5.27.
6.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
THE
APPLICATION BASED ON THE TENANT’S NOTICE TO TERMINATE
7.      The
Landlord’s application for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenant based on the assertion that the Tenant gave notice to terminate must be
dismissed. The Tenant did not give notice to terminate the tenancy to the
Landlord in compliance with the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'). 
8.      Rather
the parties exchanged a number of text messages and in one of them the Tenant
said he would remove his possessions from the unit before February 1, 2017. 
9.      This
text does not constitute a valid notice to terminate in that it does not meet
the following requirements of the Act: it does not state a date for termination
that is the last day of a month of the tenancy (s. 44); 60 days’ notice was not
provided (s. 44); it is not in the Board’s prescribed form (s. 43(1)); it is
not signed (s. 43(1)(c)); and it does not identify the rental unit (s.
43(1)(a)). 
10.   There
was also no written agreement to terminate and the Tenant remains in possession
of the rental unit. 
11.   As
a result, the Landlord’s application under s. 77 of the Act must be dismissed. 
It is
ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before April 7, 2017.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,423.12*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to March 27, 2017, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $25.97 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting March 28, 2017 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before April
7, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from April 8, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 7, 2017, then starting April 8,
2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 8, 2017.
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $2,560.00 if the payment is made on or before March 31, 2017, or
ii)       $3,350.00 if the payment is made on or before April 7, 2017**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after April 8, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
10.   The
Landlord’s application pursuant to s. 77 of the Act is dismissed.
