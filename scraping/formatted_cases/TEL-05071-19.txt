P.M. Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict M.M. (the 'Tenant') based on
arrears of rent. This is the L1 application. 
 
P.M. Inc. Limited (the 'Landlord') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict M.M. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination
date. This is the L2 application. 
 
These applications were heard in Toronto on October
22, 2019.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant
attended the hearing. The Landlord was represented by C.L. 
 
Determinations:
 
            L1 APPLICATION
 
1.     
The Tenant has paid all the
rent that was in arrears under the tenancy agreement up to August 31, 2019, and
the filing fee for this application.
2.     
As a result, and pursuant to
subsection 74(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), the
Landlord's application for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenant is discontinued.
L2 APPLICATION
3.     
By way of background this is
a month to month tenancy in which rent is due on the first of the month in the amount
of $1,142.91. 
4.     
The Landlord’s L2 application
is based on a N8 notice of termination served to the Tenant on August 13, 2019 with
a termination date of October 31, 2019 alleging the tat the Tenant has been persistently
late in paying the rent between Septemebr 2018 – August 2019. 
5.     
Since the N8 notice of
termination was served the Tenant continued to pay the rent late for the months
of September 2019 and October 2019. 
6.     
As of the hearing date, the Tenant
was not in arrears of rent; thus, the Landlord seeks a conditional order requiring
the Tenant to pay the rent on the first of every month for the next twelve months.

          TENANT’S REQUEST FOR RELIEF
7.     
The Tenant does not dispute that
the rent is due on the first day of the month or that he has paid the rent late
as claimed by the Landlord. The Tenant explains that she was previously working
part-time but started a full-time job as a personal support worker two months before
hearing. 
8.     
The Tenant wants to preserve
her tenancy and requests that the Board exercise their discretion in allowing her
to pay the rent by the end of the first week in which it comes due (on the Friday)
for the rest of her tenancy. 
9.     
In the alternative, the Tenant
seeks relief to pay the rent for November 2019 on time but the rent for December
2019 on December 6, 2019 to allow her to be able to pay the rent on time starting
January 1, 2020 for a one-year period. 
10.  
The Landlord opposes this request
because the contract between the parties explicitly indicated that the rent is due
on the first of the month and the Board does not have jurisdiction to change the
terms of a tenancy. Furthermore, if the Tenant was employed full-time two months
ago, it does not explain why the rent was not paid on time for those two months.
Finally, the Tenant ’s history shows the rent being paid later than the first week
of each month. 
ANALYSIS
11.  
Based on the evidence before
the Board I find that the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the rent.
I say this based on the Tenant ’s admission that the rent is due on the first of
the month and that she agrees she has been paying the rent late. 
12.  
However, as the months of November
and December 2019, have already passed, I will not make an order requiring these
rents to be paid by the first of the month. I will though impose an order requiring
the Tenant to pay the rent on time for 12 months as both parties requested such
an order.
13.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
14.  
This order contains all of
the reasons for my decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.   
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Landlord’s L1 application
is discontinued. 
2.     
The Tenant shall pay the
monthly rent in full and no later than the first day of every month beginning June
1, 2020 through to May 31, 2021. 
3.     
The Tenant shall pay the rent
for May 2020 in full and no later than May 6, 2020. 
4.     
If the Tenant has not already
done so, the Tenant shall pay the rent for November 2019 through to April 2020 in
full and no later than May 20, 2020. 
5.     
If the Tenant fails to make
any one of the payments in accordance with this order, the Landlord may,
without notice to the Tenant, apply to the Board pursuant to section 78 of the
Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant.
