Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-04777-18



 


 


 



 
RPMS (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict TO (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on May 31, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, FQ and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from March 1, 2018 to
May 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective April 25, 2018.
2.     
The monthly rent as of the
date of the hearing is $1,379.40.
3.     
The Tenant has lived in the
unit for over two years. The Tenant fell into arrears due to his employment
situation. Since March 2018 he has been unemployed. The Tenant says that he is
about to sign a new one year contract and will have a monthly income of
$3,000.00. 
4.     
The Tenant requested relief
and proposed a payment plan that will have June 2018 rent paid by June 15, and
the arrears paid in about seven months.
5.     
The Landlord opposed any
relief and the length of the payment plan and requested a standard order. 
6.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. I considered that even
when the Tenant was not employed, he still made partial payments toward the
rent. This seems to me that the Tenant is acting in good faith and trying to
pay the rent. I am of the view that the Tenant should be given the opportunity
to continue the tenancy and pay the arrears according to his plan.  
7.     
In the event that I granted the Tenant’s payment
plan, I explained to the Tenant that he must pay the arrears in accordance with
his plan. I also explained section 78 of the Act to the Tenant and the
consequences if he failed to pay the arrears and the rent when due. I am
satisfied that the Tenant understood the consequences of not complying with the
order.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Tenant shall pay the
Landlord $2,169.40, which represents the arrears of rent owing up to May 31,
2018 ($1,979.40), plus the Landlord’s application filing fee ($190.00).
2.     
The Tenant shall pay the
rent for June 2018 ($1,379.40), according to the following schedule:

1,000.00
                      On or before June 15, 2018             $   
379.40
3.     
The Tenant shall pay the
amount set out in paragraph one, according to the following schedule:

2018                     $    300.00
                      On or before September 15,
2018             $    300.00                  
                      On or before October 15,
2018                   $    300.00
                      On or before November 15,
2018               $    300.00
                      On or before December 15,
2018              $    300.00
                      On or before January 15,
2019                   $    300.00
                      On or before February 15,
2019                 $      69.40
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay
the monthly rent as it comes due on or before July 1, 2018, August 1, 2018,
September 1, 2018, October 1, 2018, November 1, 2018, December 1, 2018, January
1, 2019, and February 1, 2019.
5.     
If the Tenant fails to make
the payments under paragraph three, above in full, the Landlord may collect the
entire outstanding balance from the amount set out in paragraph one,
immediately. 
6.     
If the Tenant fails to make
payments under paragraphs two, three, or four, above in full and on time, the
Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
within 30 days of the breach, without notice to the Tenant, for an order
terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant; and requiring that the Tenant
pay any new arrears and NSF fees and related charges that become owing after May
31, 2018.
