Order

Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006

Number: SWL-17723-18
 











 

SH (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict MJ (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes. (L1)
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because he, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone he permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or
negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage.
 
This application was heard in [CITY] on
June 27, 2018.
 
PDR, the Landlord’s Agent, attended the
hearing.  As of 11:30 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board. 
 
Determinations:
Application to
Terminate a Tenancy and Evict a Tenant (L2)
 
1.     
The Landlord’s Agent
testified that the Tenant disposed of a washer and dryer belonging to the
Landlord that were in the basement.  He produced a copy of some text messages
between the Landlord and Tenant suggesting that there was a dispute about the
presence of extra appliances in the basement that the Tenant wanted removed. 
The Landlord’s Agent did not produce any evidence with respect to the value of
the property he claims the Tenant disposed of.
 
2.     
The Landlord’s Agent
testified that the Tenant contacted the fire department which resulted in an
order requiring the Landlord to install smoke alarms  He said that there had
been smoke alarms and a carbon monoxide detector in the premises when the
Tenant moved in but the Tenant destroyed one and claimed one did not work.  He
produced a handwritten receipt that was not on letterhead and was not signed by
anyone, dated March 22, 2018, for a total cost of $600.00 for smoke alarm and
carbon monoxide detector installation.  He did not produce any evidence with
respect to what equipment was in the premises when the Tenant took possession,
how much that equipment had cost, when it had last been inspected, or how much
the new equipment he said he purchased and installed had cost.  
 
3.     
The Landlord failed to prove
on a balance of probabilities that the Tenant wilfully or negligently caused
damage to the premises or, if he did, how much it would reasonably cost to
repair the damage.
Application to Evict a Tenant for Non-payment of Rent and
to Collect the Rent the Tenant Owes (L1)
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent he was required to pay for the period from May 1, 2018 to June 30,
2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective May 8, 2018.
 
2.      The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
 
3.      The monthly rent is $1,450.00.
 
4.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,450.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
 
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 29, 2017 to May 8, 2018.
 
6.     
The Tenant paid $1,640.00
after the application was filed.
 
7.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
Application to
Terminate a Tenancy and Evict a Tenant (L2)
 
1.     
The Application to Terminate
a Tenancy and Evict a Tenant (L2) is dismissed.
 
Application to Evict
a Tenant for Non-payment of Rent and to Collect the Rent the Tenant Owes (L1)
 
2.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before July 14,
2018.
 
3.     
As of the date of this
order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the Landlord is
entitled to by $54.98*.
4.     
However, the Landlord is
authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the Landlord owes
the Tenant:
$47.67 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting July 4, 2018
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit, and
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     
The Landlord or the Tenant
shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before July 14, 2018, then starting July 15, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 15, 2018.
 
8.     
If, on or before July 14,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $2,900.00** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after July 15, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
