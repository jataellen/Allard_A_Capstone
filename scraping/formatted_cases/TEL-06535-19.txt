Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-06535-19
 











 
 
 

Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict S.A. and R.A. (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on January 8,
2020.
 
The Landlord’s representative, N.J.,
and the Tenants attended the hearing.  The Tenants’ daughter, J.A., assisted her
parents and spoke for them at the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from January 1,
2016 to December 31, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a
Notice of Termination effective August 13, 2019.
2.     
The Tenants paid $2,534.00
after the application was filed.
3.     
This is a Rent Geared to
Income (‘RGI’) rental unit that is a five-bedroom house.  The Tenants and their
three adult children live with them in the unit.  According to the Landlord,
five of the six individuals in the unit are employed.  
4.     
The Tenants state that there
have been some health issues with some of the adults in the house and
employment has been on and off for some.  
5.     
The Tenants are asking the
Board to reduce the amount of arrears noted on the Landlord’s update sheet
provided at the hearing.  They repeatedly say that the amount is too large and
they cannot pay it.  They did not dispute any missed payments and they agreed
with that the amount claimed by the Landlord is the correct amount.  
6.     
What it seems like the
Tenants are asking for is the monthly rent to be decreased.  
7.     
Whether it is the overall
arrears or the monthly rent, the Board has no jurisdiction over the amount of
rent in an RGI unit.  Nor does it have the power to simply reduce the arrears
owing just because the Tenants say they cannot pay it.  
8.     
When I inquired as to a
possible repayment plan, the Tenants would not give me an answer as to how much
they could pay per month in addition to the monthly rent.  I asked the Tenants
multiple times and each time they gave me the same response: we are not sure
how much can be paid.
9.     
Again, the Tenants say the
monthly rent is too high.  The Landlord states that agents of the Landlord have
repeatedly sent them correspondence regarding their financial information in
order to maintain their subsidy.  The Tenants have not done what is necessary
in this regard.  
10.  
As a result, the monthly
rent is increasing to market rent of $2,598.00 on April 1, 2020.  This is
double what the Tenants’ are required to pay now.  If the Tenants cannot pay
their current rent with five working adults in the unit, I am not confident
they will be able to pay the rent at the higher amount.
11.  
With little to nothing to
work with regarding a repayment plan, the Tenants’ request for one is denied.
12.  
The Landlord has agreed to a
delay in termination until April 30, 2020.  This is almost a four-month delay. 
I find this to be reason considering the lack of information and evidence
forthcoming from the Tenants.
13.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until April 30, 2020, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of
the Act.
14.  
This order contains all of
the reasons for the decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before April
30, 2020.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $16,631.01*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 10, 2020.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $41.65 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting January 11, 2020 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing* on or before April 30, 2020, the Tenants will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from May 1,
2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before April 30, 2020, then starting May 1, 2020, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 1, 2020.
8.     
If the Tenants wish to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $16,352.00 if the payment is made on or before January 31, 2020, or
i)        $17,619.00 if the payment is made on or before February 29, 2020, or
i)        $18,886.00 if the payment is made on or before March 31, 2020, or
ii)       $21,484.00 if the payment is made on or before April 30, 2020**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after May 1, 2020
but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
