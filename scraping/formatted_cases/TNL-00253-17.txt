       Order
under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-00253-17



 


 


 



 
 
CAC
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict AA and
SMA (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe. The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on January 23, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s Representative, RH attended the hearing.

 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent
they were required to pay for the period from November 1, 2017 to January 31,
2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective December 3, 2017.
2.     The Landlord incurred costs and charges of
$100.00 for cheques tendered by or on behalf of the Tenants, which were
returned NSF.
3.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit of
$1,175.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlord.
4.     Interest on the rent deposit is owing to
the Tenants for the period from November 1, 2015 to December 3, 2017.
5.     The Tenants paid $2,485.00 after the
application was filed.
6.     I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set
out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The
Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before February 5, 2018.
2.     As of the date of this order, the amount of
the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the
arrears of rent, compensation, and any unpaid charges related to NSF cheques 
the Landlord is entitled to by $74.30*.
3.     However, the Landlord is authorized to
offset the following amounts from the amount the Landlord owes the Tenants:
$40.83 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 26,
2018 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit, and
$175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
4.     The Landlord or the Tenants shall pay to
the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 5, 2018, then starting February 6, 2018, the Landlord may file this
order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
6.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord, on or after February 6, 2018.
7.     If the Tenants wish to void this order and
continue the tenancy, they must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)      $1,516.00 if the payment is made on or before January 31, 2018, or
ii)     $2,758.00 if the payment is made on or before February 5, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 6, 2018 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
