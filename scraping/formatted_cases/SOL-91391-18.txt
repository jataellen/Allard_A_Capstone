Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-91391-18











 
 

CH (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict RH (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Hamilton on April 10,
2018.
 
Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, KM, attended the
hearing. By 4:21 p.m., the Tenant did not attend the hearing, though properly
served with the Notice of Hearing. 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
At the hearing, I observed
that the Tenant signed the attendance record before the matter was called. KM
testified that the Tenant had been at the hearing site before the hearing but
left, telling KM that she had to “pick up” her child. Before the Tenant left,
KM told her that the Landlord intended to seek a “standard order” based on
arrears of rent of $5,225.00 to April 30, 2018. Again, before leaving, the
Tenant advised KM that her name is properly spelled as set out in this order (at
KM’s request, I amended the application to reflect this spelling).
 
2.      Thereafter, I directed the commissionaire to
canvass the public areas of the hearing site, as well as the offices of the Duty
Counsel and the Mediator, calling out for the Tenant. The commissionaire
reported that the Tenant did not respond to the call. As such, I deemed that
the Tenant had abandoned her intention to participate in the hearing. I
proceeded with the hearing in the absence of the Tenant.
 
3.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from October 1, 2017
to April 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective November 30, 2017.
 
4.     
The Tenant paid $199.00
after the application was filed.
 
5.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before April 23,
2018.
 
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $3,453.87*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to April 12, 2018.
 
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $20.89 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
April 13, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before April 23, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from April
24, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before April 23, 2018, then starting April 24, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 24, 2018.
 
8.     
If, on or before April 23,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $5,400.00** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after April 24, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
