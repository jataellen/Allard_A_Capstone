Amended Order
Order under Sections 21.1 and 21.2 of
the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006
 
File Number: TSL-97498-18-RV2-AM










 
 

This
amended order is issued to correct a clerical error in the original order
issued on November 6, 2018. The amendment has been bolded and underlined for
easy reference. The rest of the order remains unchanged.
 
Review Order
 
J.L
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict R.H
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was resolved by order TSL-97498-18 issued on August 29, 2018, which
dismissed the Landlord’s application as abandoned because the Landlord did not
attend the hearing.
 
On
September 5, 2018, the Landlord requested a review of the order. The
preliminary review was granted and the Board scheduled a hearing. The
Landlord’s request to review was heard in Toronto on October 4, 2018. Only the
Landlord attended the hearing.
 
The
Landlord’s request to review was resolved by order TSL-97498-18-18-RV issued on
October 10, 2018.
 
On
October 12, 2018, the Tenant requested a review of order TSL-97498-18-RV issued
on October 10, 2018, and that the order be stayed until the request to review
is resolved.
 
On
October 17, 2018, order TSL-97498-18-RV-IN was issued, staying the order issued
on October 10, 2018.
 
The
Tenant’s request to review was heard in Toronto on November 1, 2018. The
Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 


 
Determinations:
 
Review
 
1.     
The Tenant testified that he had not received a copy of the Notice
of Hearing.  Nevertheless, his evidence was that he attended the Board on the
day of hearing and saw and spoke with the Landlord.  
 
2.     
The Landlord acknowledged that he had seen and spoken with the
Tenant within 30 minutes of speaking to his application on an unopposed basis,
but took no steps to bring the Tenant to the hearing room, or speaking to the
front counter about having the hearing reconvened.  
 
3.     
On the basis that the Tenant did attend the hearing date on
October 4, 2018 with the intention of participating, and the Landlord took no
steps to facilitate the participation, the request to review is granted.
 
Landlord’s application
 
4.     
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to
pay for the period from March 19, 2018 to November 18, 2018.  Because of the
arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 3, 2018.
 
5.     
The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
 
6.     
The monthly rent as of the date of the hearing is $2,400.00 and
the rental term is the 19th to the 20th of each month.
 
7.     
The Tenant testified that he has made two payments in June to the
Landlord for a total of $4,800.00, but had no corroborating evidence that the
payments had been made.  The Landlord testified that he had received no
payments from the Tenant since the application was filed.  On a balance of
probabilities, I find that no payments were made by the Tenant and that the
amount owing to October 19, 2018 is $15,200.00.
 
8.     
The
Tenant complained that the Landlord had applied the last month rent deposit to
rent that was outstanding for January, 2018, but there was no evidence that the
Tenant had paid January’s rent, and to reverse the payment would only increase
the arrears of the Tenant.
 
9.     
The
Tenant has occupied the rental unit for approximately 18 months.  He testified
that he lives in the unit along.  He was offered the opportunity to provide any
circumstances to consider in relation to whether the eviction should be delayed
or denied, but did not do so.  
 
10.  
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance
with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Tenant’s request to review is granted. Order TSL-97498-18-RV
issued on October 10, 2018 is cancelled and replaced by the following order. 
 
2.     
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of
the rental unit on or before November 17, 2018.
 
3.     
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $15,587.43*, which represents
the amount of rent owing and compensation up to November 6, 2018.
 
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $78.90 per day for
compensation for the use of the unit starting November 7, 2018 to the date the
Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of
filing the application.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated on or before November 17, 2018, then
starting November 18, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
November 18, 2018.
 
8.     
If, on or before November 17, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of
$17,790.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction
will be void.  This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the
Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on
time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that
subsection on or after November 18, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant
possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
