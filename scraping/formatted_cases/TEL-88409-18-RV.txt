Order under Section 21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-88409-18-RV
 










 
 

Review Order
 
DRNPHC.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict TV
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was resolved by order TEL-88409-18 issued on March 6, 2018.
 
On
March 7, 2018, the Tenant requested a review of the order.
 
The
request was heard in Whitby on March 16, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, LG, and the Tenant attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The
Landlord consented to the Tenant’s request to review; therefore, the review is
granted.
2.     The
Tenant has not paid the total rent she was required to pay for the period from
December 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective January 29, 2018.
3.     The
Tenant paid $250.00 after the application was filed.
4.     The
Tenant requested a repayment plan that would bring her balance to a zero as of
May 22, 2018.  She stated she is receiving Ontario Works and they just require
the Landlord to confirm the rent.  The Tenant further stated that she has made
her worker aware of the issue with her rent.  
5.     The
Landlord stated there is another order they intend to enforce with the sheriff
dealing with a damage claim due to a fire.  The Tenant stated she is sending in
a review for that application as well because she was unaware there were two
separate hearings for two different issues.  
6.     The
second issue pertaining to the damage claim is separate from the issue of
non-payment.  For that reason, I am basing my decision solely on the
non-payment situation.
7.     The
repayment plan the Tenant proposed is reasonable and I am satisfied the Tenant
will adhere to the plan.  
8.     I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act. 
9.     This
order contains all of the reasons for my decision within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.  
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order
TEL-88409-18 issued on March 6, 2018 is cancelled and replaced by the
following: 
2.     The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $452.00 for arrears of rent to March 31, 2018
and costs.
3.     The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord the amount set out above in paragraph 2, and
new rent as it comes due, in accordance with the following schedule:
a)    $226.00
on or before March 20, 2018;
b)    April
2018 rent on or before April 3, 2018;
c)    $113.00
on or before April 20, 2018;
d)    May
2018 rent on or before May 1, 2018; and
e)    $113.00
on or before May 22, 2018.
4.     If
the Tenant fails to make any one of the payments in accordance with this order,
the outstanding balance of any arrears of rent and costs to be paid by the
Tenant to the Landlord pursuant to paragraph 2 of this order shall become
immediately due and owing and the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant,
apply to the Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating
the tenancy and evicting the Tenant and requiring that the Tenant pay any new
arrears, NSF fees and related charges that became owing after March 31, 2018.
