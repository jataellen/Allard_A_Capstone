Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-76077-16
 










 
 
 

M.A.C.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict J.B.
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application
was heard in Toronto on February 1, 2017.
 
The
Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing. The Landlord was represented by V.C..
 
Determinations:
 
1.      There
is no dispute between the parties that the Tenant has not paid the total rent
the Tenant was required to pay for the period from October 1, 2016 to February
28, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective December 19, 2016.
2.      There
is also no dispute that the arrears of rent owing for the period ending February
28, 2017 total $4,450.00.
3.      Finally,
there is no dispute that the Landlord incurred costs of $170.00 for filing the
application and is entitled to reimbursement of those costs.
4.      Rather
the issue between the parties is with respect to the Tenant’s request for
relief from eviction in the form of a repayment plan. The Tenant would like to
remain in the rental unit and repay the arrears at the rate of $500.00 a month.

5.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). For
the reasons stated below, I find that it would be unfair in all of the
circumstances to impose on the Landlord the Tenant’s proposed repayment plan,
but it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 28, 2017,
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
6.      Both
parties here have sympathetic personal circumstances.
7.      This
tenancy began on August 1, 2016. The monthly rent is $1,100.00. The Tenant
lives there with her 14 year old daughter.
8.      The
Tenant is a single mother who was working full-time and going to school
full-time when a bout of the flu developed into full blown pneumonia in
November of 2016. She became too ill to work and then was hospitalised for a
few days. 
9.      In
October of 2016 the Tenant short-paid the rent by $50.00. She cannot remember
why but she believes this happened because her work hours were shorter than
expected. She spoke to the Landlord about it and planned to make up the short
fall quickly but then became very ill. 
10.   By
the end of November, 2016 the Tenant was ready to return to work and to school
but her employer had decided to hire someone to replace her in the interim so
she had no job. Her employment had been “under the table” so she was not
eligible for Employment Insurance. Her child support and the child tax benefit
total $714.00 monthly and she could not afford to pay rent. She is also in
arrears to the Landlord for utilities. 
11.   The
Tenant now has a new job and has temporarily withdrawn from her school program.
She started working on January 27, 2017. Her total income is sufficient to pay
rent and $500.00 towards her debt to the Landlord every month. At that rate it
would take the Tenant more than nine months to pay off the rent arrears alone. 
12.   The
Landlord is also experiencing financial difficulties. He is 65 years old and
just started receiving Canada Pension Plan. That and his rental income from two
rental properties are his only sources of income. 
13.   The
residential complex has three residential units in it but only two are rented
to tenants. The third is occupied by a relative who is not a tenant; he does
not regularly pay the Landlord rent although contributes something
occasionally. 
14.   The
income from the other two tenants is insufficient to cover all of the fixed
monthly costs the Landlord has to pay for mortgage, property taxes and
insurance. So the Tenant’s non-payment of rent and utilities has resulted in
the Landlord having to draw on his line of credit. His other rental property is
a single family home. The rent on that unit is sufficient to cover the
operating costs and provide a small income.
15.   So
the problem is that the Landlord is experiencing financial hardship and the
Tenant’s repayment plan is simply too lengthy to be fair given his income
profile unfair. 
16.   That
being said, the Tenant should be granted some relief as her illness was unanticipated
and beyond her control. Further, the Landlord collected a rent deposit of
$2,250.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
This amount is well in excess of what the Landlord was legally allowed to
collect as a rent deposit from this Tenant. Neither party raised this as an
issue at the hearing. 
17.   Given
all of the above it seems to me that the fairest thing to do is to issue a
standard voidable eviction order but give the Tenant additional time to pay or
find a new place to live. 
18.   Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from August 1, 2016
to December 19, 2016 in the amount of $17.39. If the Tenant vacates the rental unit
as a result of this order, this amount and the deposit shall be applied to the
rent arrears owing. 
19.   This
order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further
reasons shall be issued.
It is
ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before February 28, 2017.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,233.09*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to February 3, 2017, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $36.16 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 4, 2017 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $170.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
February 14, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from February 15, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2017, then starting March 1,
2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2017.
8.      If,
on or before February 28, 2017, the Tenant pays the amount of $4,620.00** to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. 
This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain
in the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after March 1, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
