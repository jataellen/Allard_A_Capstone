Order under Section 21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-64707-17-RV
 











 
 

Review Order
 
RC (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict FC (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (L1 application).
 
The Landlord’s L1 application
was resolved by order CEL-64707-1, issued on April 12, 2017.
 
On May 1, 2017, the
Tenant requested a review of that order.
 
The Tenant’s review
request was heard in Mississauga on May 15, 2017.
 
The
Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing. The Landlord was represented by
paralegal SS.
 
Preliminary Matter:
 
The
Tenant’s request to adjourn the review hearing was refused at the hearing. He
said that he was still organizing his evidence and witnesses for an upcoming
T2/T6 application that the Tenant is filing. This evidence has no relevance to
the issue to be determined in the review. As a result, the requested
adjournment was refused since it is not necessary.
 
Determinations and Reasons:
 
1.     
The Tenant attended the
original hearing. He disputed the January rent arrears at that hearing. The
Tenant’s review request alleges that there is a serious error in the order with
respect to the amount of rent arrears ordered for January 2017.
2.     
There is a serious error in
the April 12th order. The rent arrears amount that was ordered is
incorrect. January 2017 rent was ordered. However, it was already paid to the Board
in trust on January 3, 2017 in a prior application (CEL-63007-16). As a result
of the serious error, the review request is granted.
3.     
The monthly rent is $700.00.
This is undisputed.
4.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent he was required to pay for the period from January 1, 2017 to May
31, 2017. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a N4 Notice of
Termination effective February 16, 2017.
5.     
January 2017 rent has been
paid. This is undisputed.
6.     
February and March rent have
not been paid. This is also undisputed.
7.     
The Tenant paid $700.00
after the application was filed. This was paid on March 31st and the
parties both consider it to be payment for the April rent.
8.     
The May rent has not been
paid. However, the Tenant intends to move out of the rental unit on May 31st.
If that occurs, the last month's rent deposit will cover the May rent.
9.     
There is no dispute that the
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $700.00 from the Tenant when the tenancy
commenced.
10.   The exact date the deposit was collected was not
clarified during the hearing so no finding is made on the date it was collected
or whether any interest is owing to the Tenant on the deposit.
11.   At the review hearing the Landlord's Legal
Representative stated that the Landlord applied the deposit to the November
2016 rent. The Tenant was not previously aware of this and has received no
notice from the Landlord that the deposit was applied.
12.   Subsection 106(10) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') states that a landlord must apply the
deposit to the last month of the tenancy. As a result, the Landlord cannot unilaterally
and arbitrarily decide to apply it to November rent.
13.   The Landlord's Legal Representative acknowledged
that the Act requires that the deposit be applied to the last month of the tenancy.
As a result, the Landlord's Legal Representative requested to amend the Landlord’s
L1 application to seek the November 2016 rent.
14.   The request to amend the application is refused.
First of all, the Tenant was given no advance notice of the possibility of an
amendment so he would have no idea the review hearing would now involve a claim
for the November rent.
15.   Furthermore, it is not possible to simply amend
the L1 application at this point to seek the November 2016 rent. The L1
application is dependent on a valid N4 notice of termination.
16.   Subsection 59(2) of the Act requires that the N4
notice set out the correct amount of rent due.
17.   The N4 notice of termination that the Landlord
gave to the Tenant on February 2, 2017 claims only January and February rent.
18.   The Landlord’s prior L1 application
(CEL-63007-16) was based on a N4 notice of termination dated November 3, 2016
that claimed the November rent. Yet, by the time the L1 application was filed
on December 5, 2016 only the December rent was claimed. I have listened to the
recording of that prior hearing. At the hearing of the prior L1 application on
January 4, 2017, the Landlord stated that the full amount owing has been paid
and he withdrew the application.
19.   The Landlord's Legal Representative is
suggesting that the Landlord may have made an error in that prior application.
However, that cannot be corrected under the Tenant’s review request of this
subsequent application that made no mention of the November rent.
20.   The Tenant was granted a rent abatement of
$420.00 in the April 12th order. The determinations made regarding
the laundry access and the rent abatement that was ordered were not an issue in
the review request and they remain unchanged. This amount is deducted from the
rent arrears owing.
21.   For clarity’s sake, the amount the Tenant owes
the Landlord is the February and March 2017 rent ($700.00 x 2 months =
$1,400.00) minus the $420.00 rent abatement which equals $980.00. May rent is
also owing if the Tenant does not vacate the unit on May 31st and
the rent deposit is not applied.
22.   The Tenant also owes the Landlord $190.00 for
the application filing fee. There is no dispute that some rent was owing to the
Landlord on the date the application was filed (February 17, 2017). As a
result, there was justification for the application and the Landlord is
entitled to reimbursement of this fee. The Tenant is not eligible for a waiver
of this fee based on his limited income. The Board’s waiver process is
applicable only to a low income applicant and not to a respondent. The Tenant
is the respondent in this application that the applicant/landlord filed.
23.   I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until May 31, 2017 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the
Act. The Tenant has made plans to vacate the rental unit on May 31st
and there is a last month's rent deposit to cover the May rent.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Order CEL-64707-17, issued
on April 12, 2017, is varied in the following manner:
2.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before May 31,
2017.
3.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $596.11*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to May 16, 2017, less the rent deposit and less the amount of the rent
abatement the Landlord owes the Tenant.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $23.01 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
May 17, 2017 to the date they move out of the unit.
5.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before May 31, 2017, then starting June 1, 2017, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 1, 2017.
8.     
If, on or before May 31,
2017, the Tenant pays the amount of $1,870.00** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after June 1, 2017 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
