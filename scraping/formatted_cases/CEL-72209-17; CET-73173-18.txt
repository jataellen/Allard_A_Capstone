CET-73173-18
Order under Sections 30,
31 and 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 











 
 
 

SH and MH (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict DM and JM (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord
requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation (CEL-72209-17). 
 
The Tenants applied for an order determining that the Landlords harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered
with them, substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental
unit or residential complex by the Tenants or by a member of their household
and withheld or deliberately interfered with the reasonable supply of a vital
service, care service, or food that the Landlords are obligated to supply under
the tenancy agreement (T2).
 
The Tenants also applied for an order determining that
the Landlords failed to meet the Landlords' maintenance obligations under the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') or failed to comply with health, safety, housing
or maintenance standards (T6) (CET-73173-18).
 
These applications were heard together in Mississauga
on February 27, 2018.
 
One of the Landlords, MH, the
Landlords’ Legal Representative, DY, the Tenants, and the Tenants’ Legal
Representative, RS, attended the hearing.
 
The following witnesses testified
at the hearing:
EG (MH’s friend) (on behalf of the
Landlords)
BT (MH’s brother) (on behalf of
the Landlords)
 
Determinations:
 
Regarding CEL-72209-17
 
1.     
The N12 notice of
termination at the root of the Landlords’ application was served on the Tenants
on December 15, 2017 pursuant to section 48 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) and stated that the Landlords require possession of
the rental unit for the purposes of residential occupation by their daughter.  
2.     
The Landlords’ daughter did
not testify at the hearing.  The Landlords’ relied on their daughter’s sworn
affidavit. In her affidavit, she confirmed that she intends to move into the
rental unit; will live there for at least one year; the rental unit is closer
to her university; and that she will be able to study in a quiet and more
independent environment. 
3.     
MH also confirmed that the
rental unit is closer to her daughter’s university, as well as her daughter’s
place of employment and the church where her daughter regularly volunteers. MH
stated that since her daughter started university in September, she has
complained about her travel time back and forth to school and her inability to
properly study.  Her daughter currently lives with the Landlords and their
other two daughters.  
4.     
The Tenants did not dispute
the reasons for the Landlords’ daughter moving into the rental unit.  But
argued that the reasonableness of their plans is not the test for good faith.  The
Tenants submitted that the N12 notice was served in bad faith, as it was in
response to an email they sent on December 14, 2017 regarding legal action they
plan to take regarding the inadequate replacement appliances at the rental
unit. 
5.     
The Tenants also stated that
they had a good relationship with the Landlords until the Landlords attempted
to raise the rent by $300.00-$400.00.  The Tenants further stated that the
Landlords also demanded an additional rent deposit of $7,800.00 prior to the
commencement of the tenancy.  According to the Tenants, their refusal to pay
the rent increase was also a reason the Landlords served the N12 notice.  The
Tenants submitted this is the only way the Landlords could terminate the
tenancy. 
6.     
Based on the evidence before
me, I am satisfied that the Landlords in good faith require possession of the
rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The affidavit filed by
the Landlords complies with section 72 of the Act.  And while the Landlords’
daughter did not testify at the hearing, there was no dispute regarding her
reasons for occupying the rental unit.  
7.     
The evidence before me did
not support a finding that the N12 notice was served only as a response to the
Tenants’ email of December 14, 2017 or to the Tenants’ refusal to pay an
unlawful rent increase. The uncontested evidence supported a finding that the
Landlords’ daughter has a genuine intention to move into the rental unit.  
8.     
The Tenants’ Legal
Representative relied on and submitted order TSL-54279-14.  Other decisions of
the Board are not binding on me. Furthermore, the decision can be distinguished
from this case, especially since the member in order TSL-54279-14 found that
the occupancy by the Landlord’s child “may be, in the end, a temporary
occupancy until she purchases a home in the area.”  This is not the fact in
this matter.  The Landlords’ daughter intends to reside in the rental unit
until she completes her university program and signed an affidavit that it will
be a minimum of one-year, a time frame the Legislature has contemplated does
not amount to temporary by amending subsection 48(1) of the Act to specifically
state for a period of at least one year.
9.     
There was no dispute that
the Tenants sent an email to the Landlords on December 14, 2017 at 10:41 p.m.
demanding action from the Landlords by December 20, 2017 or the Tenants will
commence an application before the Board. The Tenants submitted that the N12
notice served on December 15, 2017 was the Landlords’ direct response to this
email.   However, the Landlords’ witness, EG, confirmed that MH on Wednesday
December 13, 2017 requested EG’s assistance with delivering the N12 notice to
the Tenants that Friday, being December 15, 2017.  EG’s testimony was candid
and consistent.  Therefore, I found her evidence to be credible.   
10.  
Consequently, if the
Landlords contemplated giving a N12 notice to the Tenants as of at least
December 13, 2017, then the N12 notice was not served in response to the
Tenants email received in the late evening of December 14, 2017. 
11.  
The Tenants also submitted that
the N12 notice was given because the Tenants refused to pay a substantial rent
increase requested by the Landlords.  The Tenants claimed that the Landlords
wanted to increase the rent by $300.00 to $400.00 after the term of their
initial written tenancy expired.  
12.  
The parties initially signed
a five year lease term commencing May 1, 2010.  Therefore, the period of time
that any discussion of a rent increase would have occurred was when the lease
expired in May 2015.  I find it unlikely that the Landlords waited until
December 2017 to serve a N12 notice as retribution for the Tenants not agreeing
to a substantial rent increase approximately two and half years prior. 
13.  
The Tenants have resided in
the rental unit with their four children since May 2010.  The Tenants relied on
their bad faith argument with respect to the N12 notice and have not found
alternate accommodations.  DM stated she suffers from PTSD which causes severe
anxiety and agitation.  
14.  
The Landlords’ daughter
would like to reside at the rental unit as soon as possible.  She continues to
commute to university, work and her volunteer position.  
15.  
Having considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), I find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until June 30, 2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of
the Act.
16.  
The Tenants have resided in
the rental unit for almost eight years.  Their children attend the local
schools and they require additional time to find alternate housing given DM’s
health issues.  I am satisfied that a delay until the end of June 2018 provides
a sufficient time frame for the Tenants to find accommodation without
significant prejudice the Landlords’ daughter.  The Landlords’ daughter is
still able to attend university, her employment and her volunteer position from
her current residence in the interim. 
17.  
The Landlords have paid the
Tenants the required compensation pursuant to section 48.1 of the Act.
 
Regarding CET-73173-18
T2 application
18.   In this application, the Tenants alleged that the Landlords harassed
the Tenants, substantially interfered with the Tenants’ reasonable enjoyment of
the rental unit and withheld or deliberately interfered with a vital service.  
A number of the Tenants’ issues in this application also related to the
Tenants’ T6 application with respect to the Landlords’ failure to maintain the
appliances and the furnace.   Those allegations will be addressed in regards to
the T6 application below.
Harassment and Substantial Interference 
19.   The Tenants stated that they had a good relationship with the
Landlords until the Landlords tried to increase the rent by $300.00-$400.00 in
2015.  The Tenants were also upset that the Landlords demanded that the Tenants
pay a rent deposit of $7,800.00 representing three months’ rent at the time at
the commencement of the tenancy.   As well, according to JM, in every
conversation with the Landlords after the initial term of the tenancy, the
Landlords complained that the “rent is too low” or “I am losing money.” 
20.   JM stated that they had to take care of everything on their own.  It
has only been in the last year that they put their foot down and now they feel
like the Landlords are bullying them.  The Tenants were extremely upset that MH
made a racist comment towards DM when MH attended the rental unit on December
7, 2017.  The comment to DM was something to the effect that MH only decided to
replace the appliances “because you are married to a white man.”  DM was
concerned how she would be treated if she were not married to a white man.  
21.   MH denied making the above comment.  MH provided her own version of
the events on that day, December 7, 2017, when she attended the rental unit.  
She stated that DM grabbed her arm and stated that she is not leaving until she
gives permission to replace the stove.  MH also stated that it was on this day when
she first advised the Tenants that her daughter wants to move into the rental
unit.   MH said she left the unit shaking.
22.   The Landlords’ brother, BT, testified that he received a call from
MH, who was crying, and advised that the Tenants wouldn’t allow her to leave. 
BT subsequently went to the rental unit that night.  According to BT, DM was
aggressive towards MH when they returned to the rental unit. BT also testified
that DM said that MH “can’t speak English properly and she is a pharmacist.”  
23.   There was no dispute that the Landlords collected three months as a
deposit in the initial tenancy agreement.  The Tenants confirmed that at the
time of entering the tenancy, they were going through bankruptcy proceedings
and they paid the amount requested.  The Landlords are no longer retaining
these moneys and haven’t been for over one year, which is the time limitation
for a tenant to make an application for illegal collection or retention of
moneys by a landlord.  
24.   The Tenants have only raised the collection of the three month
deposit and the demand for an unlawful increase after receiving the N12 notice. 
I am not satisfied that these two issues amount to a pattern of harassment. 
Not only are they separated by a time span of five years, but these issues most
likely formed part of negotiations between the parties which in the end led to
agreements.  In the first instance, the written tenancy agreement and in the
second instance, a guideline increase.  JM confirmed after the Landlords
initial request for a large increase, that he annually calculated the lawful
increase in accordance with the guideline for the Landlords.  
25.   As far as the comments made by the Landlords regarding the rent
being too low, I find it probable that the Landlords have made this comment in
the past, however I am not satisfied that in any context it rose to the level
of harassment.  The Landlords never demanded more rent after the initial discussion
in 2015, always accepted and allowed the Tenants to deduct repairs from the
rent and addressed the Tenants concerns (other than the issue with the new
appliances being inadequate according to the Tenants).
26.   Based on the evidence before me, I find it more likely than not that
this application for harassment and substantial interference only arose as a
result of the Tenants’ displeasure with the new appliances at the rental unit
and because they received the N12 notice of termination.  
27.   JM confirmed under cross examination that the parties’ agreement was
for the Tenants to arrange and effect repairs as needed at the rental unit.  The
Tenants wanted some autonomy at the rental unit and didn’t want the Landlords
attending the premises regularly.  There was a demonstrated pattern of the
Tenants contacting repair and service contractors, paying for the
repair/service, then deducting the amounts from the rent as agreed.  
28.   Also, I am not satisfied that because the Landlords requested the
Tenants help with measuring the old appliances, disconnecting them or having to
store the old fridge for five days amounted to harassment or a substantial
interference with their reasonable enjoyment of the premises.  While it is the
Landlords’ obligation to maintain the rental unit, asking or requiring the
Tenants co-operation in achieving that does not amount to a substantial
interference, especially not in the circumstances of this case.
29.   As well, based on the evidence before me, I find it more likely than
not that both parties made inappropriate and racist comments to one another
during their confrontation at the rental unit on December 7, 2017.  As such, I
am not satisfied that only the Landlords should be held accountable for this
shared inappropriate conduct.  Especially since DM’s conduct was also
physically aggressive towards MH. 
30.   Finally, I find it more likely than not that the Tenants conduct on
December 7, 2017 was a result of finding out that the Landlords’ daughter would
like to reside in the rental unit.  The parties had a good relationship and
understanding regarding the tenancy up to this date. MH testified that she
rarely attended the rental unit and in fact prior to December 7, 2017 it had
been months.  The Tenants did not provide any specific dates regarding other
confrontations with the Landlords, yet suggested that the Landlords are
bullies.  
31.   The evidence before me did not support a finding that the Landlords
bullied the Tenants.  The Tenants complained about the appliances being too old
and constantly breaking down at the end of October 2017, the Landlords replaced
the appliances by mid-December 2017.   This short timeframe does not
demonstrate that the Landlords were refusing to act or holding out against the
Tenants. Even after the physical confrontation between MH and DM on December 7,
2017, the Landlords decided to replace the stove and did so the following
week.  
32.   The Landlords replaced the dishwasher and fridge at the rental unit
on December 7, 2017. The stove was replaced on December 14, 2017 at the rental
unit.  According to the Tenants, these new appliances are inadequate for a
family of six.  They are smaller than the original appliances, the dishwasher
cycle takes longer, and the stove is not self-cleaning.   These issues with the
new appliances were the subject of the Tenants’ email sent to the Landlords on
December 14, 2017.  The Tenants believe that the Landlords refusal to address
these issues has led to a substantial interference with their reasonable
enjoyment of the premises.  
33.   The Tenants’ Legal Representative argued that the Tenants are
entitled to compensation as the Tenants’ had contracted for specific appliances
that were subsequently replaced by the Landlords with diminished ones.   While
this argument may be correct, it must be made pursuant to section 130 of the
Act.  This T2 application filed pursuant to section 29 of the Act with remedies
available pursuant to section 31 of the Act is not the relevant application.
34.  
Section 130 of the Act specifically
contemplates that a landlord may unilaterally reduce or discontinue a service
or facility that was originally provided and formed part of the tenancy
agreement. If a landlord removes a service or facility the tenant may file the
applicable application with the Board and request a rent reduction. That
application is a T3 application.
 
35.   Subsection 2(1) of the Act states:
“services
and facilities” includes,
            (a)       furniture,
appliances and furnishings,
36.  
I agree with and adopt
the following reasoning as set out in order CET-68554-17-RV:
a)   
Section 130 of the
Act states:
130 (1) A tenant of a rental unit may apply to the Board for an order
for a reduction of the rent charged for the rental unit due to a reduction or
discontinuance in services or facilities provided in respect of the rental unit
or the residential complex.  
Same, former
tenant
(2)  A
former tenant of a rental unit may apply under this section as a tenant of the
rental unit if the person was affected by the discontinuance or reduction of
the services or facilities while the person was a tenant of the rental unit.  
Order re
lawful rent
(3)  The
Board shall make findings in accordance with the prescribed rules and may
order,
             (a)          that the rent charged be reduced by a
specified amount;
            (b)           that there be a rebate to the tenant of
any rent found to have been unlawfully collected by the landlord;
            (c)            that the rent charged be reduced by a
specified amount for a specified period if there has been a temporary reduction
in a service.  
Same
(4)  An
order under this section reducing rent takes effect on the day that the
discontinuance or reduction first occurred.  
Same, time
limitation
(5)  No
application may be made under this section more than one year after a reduction
or discontinuance in a service or facility.  
 
b)   
The amount of the
rent reduction that a tenant may be entitled to is determined in accordance
with the prescribed rules that are set out in section 39 of Ontario Regulation
516/06 (the ‘Regulation’) made under the Act. 
c)   
The Regulation sets
out different rules for determining an appropriate rent reduction depending on
whether a landlord’s removal or discontinuance of a service was reasonable or
unreasonable.
d)   
Therefore, whether a
landlord’s removal of a service was reasonable or unreasonable, a tenant’s
remedy is a rent reduction which is determined in accordance with the
prescribed rules.
e)   
The Tenants did not
file a T3 application. They filed a T2 application claiming substantial
interference. That claim is governed by sections 29 and 31 of the Act which
permit different remedies to be requested and ordered.
f)    
In this case, the
Tenants were requesting that the free visitor’s parking be re-instated. That is
not an available remedy under section 130 of the Act.
g)   
I acknowledge that
there may be circumstances where a reduction or discontinuance in a service or
facility could potentially be characterized as a substantial interference with
a tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex.
However, in my view, it is not appropriate to permit that type of claim to be
filed under a T2 application so that a tenant may circumvent section 130 of the
Act and request a different remedy than what is provided for under the Act or
to get around the one year limitation period set out in subsection 130(5) of
the Act.
h)   
Substantial
interference with reasonable enjoyment is very broad and general claim and
could potentially encompass any number of issues that could arise during a
tenancy. However, when an issue raised in an application falls under a more
specific and applicable section of the Act, the issue should be determined
under that specific and applicable section.
i)    
This is similar to
the situation that arises when a tenant does not pay the rent that is due.
There is an applicable process, remedy and application for rent arrears.
Although a tenant’s failure to pay the rent could potentially be characterized
or claimed as a substantial interference with a landlord’s reasonable enjoyment
of the residential complex, the Board does not determine rent arrears issues
under that type of claim. It requires a landlord to follow the applicable
process and sections in the Act regarding rent arrears.
37.   Consequently, to make a finding based on an application under
section 29 of the Act instead of a finding based under section 130 disregards
the statutory framework as the Act contemplates a change in a service or
facility that is provided as part of the tenancy and the Act provides rules and
remedies for such a change.  
Vital Services / T6 application
Furnace 
38.   The Tenants stated that the house wasn’t heating properly.  They
believed there was an issue with the furnace.  JM stated that in March 2017,
the furnace broke down.  A Reliance Home Services (Reliance) repairperson
attended at that time and fixed the furnace.  According to JM, they suggested
the furnace be replaced.   On April 29, 2017, the Tenants wrote to the
Landlords that the furnace has rust on the inside and should be examined by a
professional.  
39.   On December 7, 2017, the Tenants raised the issue with the furnace
again while BT was at the unit. He testified that the Tenants complained about
rust on the furnace.  BT further testified that he asked them if they lost
heat, but they just mentioned the rust.   
40.   On January 15, 2018, according to the Tenants, the furnace stopped
working.  The Tenants contacted the Landlords and called Reliance to attend to
issue with the furnace.  There was no dispute that the furnace was replaced
within four days.  The Tenants stated that they were without heat for those four
days.  
41.   The Tenants stated that the appliances at the rental unit were old
and not working properly.  On October 30, 2017, they sent a letter to the
Landlords advising that the fridge is not working properly, the dishwasher top
rack can no longer be used as the side rollers are worn, and that the stove
works but can still be “unpredictable.”  In this letter, the Tenants asked if
the Landlords would consider replacing the appliances.  
42.   There was no dispute that the fridge and dishwasher were replaced and
installed on December 7, 2017.   On December 7, 2017, while at the rental unit,
the Tenants asked MH about the stove. According to the Tenants, the repair
person advised them that the stove was a fire hazard, so they stopped using the
stove at that point.
43.   According to MH, only DM said that the stove was a fire hazard.  The
electrician installing the other appliances, inspected the stove and told MH to
save yourself some problems and buy a new stove.  BT stated that when he was at
the unit that night, the Tenants complained about the knobs on the stove having
no numbers; that it doesn’t work properly; and that it is a fire hazard because
the kids can’t tell if the stove is on or not.  According to BT the electrician
told him there is a repair kit and the switch issue can be fixed but whatever
fixes are done will not satisfy the Tenants. 
44.   Subsection 20(1) of the Act states the following:
A
landlord is responsible for providing and maintaining a residential complex,
including the rental units in it, in a good state of repair and fit for habitation
and for complying with health, safety, housing and maintenance standards.  
45.   Subsection 21(1) of the Act states the following:
A
landlord shall not at any time during a tenant’s occupancy of a rental unit and
before the day on which an order evicting the tenant is executed, withhold the
reasonable supply of any vital service, care service or food that it is the landlord’s
obligation to supply under the tenancy agreement or deliberately interfere with
the reasonable supply of any vital service, care service or food.  
46.  
The evidence before me did
not support a finding that the Landlords withheld or deliberately interfered
with the vital service of heat.   Although, it was not disputed that the
Tenants did not have any heat for four days, this was related to the repair
issue with the furnace not the actions of the Landlords. 
47.  
The Ontario Court of Appeal in Onyskiw v. CJM Property
Management Ltd. (2016 ONCA 477) has determined that landlord is not automatically in breach of their
maintenance obligations as soon as a problem arises and a contextual approach is necessary in
determining whether or not a landlord has breached their maintenance
obligations under section 20 of the Act. That approach involves a consideration
of the “entirety of the factual situation” before determining that a landlord
is in breach of their maintenance obligations.
48.   The evidence before me was insufficient to find that there was an
issue with the heat at the rental unit prior to the furnace breaking down on
January 15, 2018.   The Tenants’ letter to the Landlords in April 2017 only
stated an issue with rust and a concern that the furnace needed to be
inspected.  There were no other complaints verbally or in writing regarding any
lack of heat in the rental unit until the furnace broke down.  
49.   The Landlords responded to the issue with the furnace, they
immediately authorized a replacement.  However, there was no dispute that there
was no heat in the rental unit between January 15, 2018 and January 18, 2018 while
the furnace was being replaced.     Therefore, I find that the Landlord was in breach of their maintenance
obligations under section 20 of the Act.
50.   The Landlord did not ignore the issue, but the
Tenants did not get what they paid for. The Tenants requested an abatement of
rent of $400.00 for the four days they were without heat. 
51.   The monthly rent is $2,734.85.  Therefore, the
per diem (daily) rate is calculated at $89.91 ($2,734.85 x 12/365). 
Consequently, I find an abatement of rent of $359.64 equal to 100% for four
days to be appropriate given that no heat at the rental unit in the month of
January had a significant impact on the Tenants. 
52.   The Landlords were on notice as of October 30, 2017 that the Tenants
were experiencing various issues with the dishwasher, fridge and stove.  The Landlords
decided to replace the dishwasher and fridge instead of repairing them. The new
dishwasher and fridge were installed on December 7, 2017.  At that time, the
Landlords also decided to replace the stove and a new stove was installed on
December 14, 2017.  
53.   The Landlords responded to the Tenants’ complaints regarding the
issues with the appliances by ordering new appliances.  However, there was no
dispute that the Tenants had improperly working appliances for a period of
approximately six weeks as no repairs were completed while the appliances were
ordered and installed.  Therefore, I find
that the Landlord was in breach of their maintenance obligations under section
20 of the Act.
54.   The Tenants requested an abatement of rent of
$500.00 for the six weeks in which the appliances were not working properly and
$500.00 for out of pocket expenses related to having no working stove for seven
days.  The Tenants failed to substantiate their claim for any out of pocket
expenses related to not having a working stove. There were no receipts provided
to support their claim of purchasing pre-cooked food.
55.   I find that an abatement of $500.00 for the six
week period in which the Tenants did not have full functioning appliances is
appropriate in these circumstances.  There were various inconveniences
associated with the issues the dishwasher, fridge and stove which would impact
the Tenants full use of the rental unit.
56.   As stated above the Tenants’ issues with the
replacement appliances being inadequate and/or diminished in some capacity is
also not relevant under a T6 application, as there was no dispute that the new
appliances were operational.  
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlords and the Tenants is terminated, as of June 30, 2018. The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before June 30, 2018.
2.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 30, 2018, then starting July 1, 2018, the Landlords may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
3.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlords on or after July 1, 2018.
4.     
The T2 application is
dismissed.
5.     
The Landlords shall pay to
the Tenants a rent abatement of $859.64.
6.     
The Landlords shall also pay
to the Tenants $50.00 for the cost of filing the application.
7.     
The total amount the
Landlords owe is $909.64.
8.     
The Landlords shall pay the
Tenants the full amount owing by April 1, 2018.
9.     
If the Landlords do not pay
the Tenants the full amount owing by April 1, 2018, they will owe interest.
This will be simple interest calculated from April 2, 2018 at 3.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
10.  
If the Landlords does not pay the Tenants the
full amount owing by April 1, 2018, the Tenants may recover this amount by
deducting $909.64 from the rent for April 2018.
