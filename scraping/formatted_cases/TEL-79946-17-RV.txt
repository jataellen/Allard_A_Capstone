Order under Section 21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-79946-17-RV
 










 
 

Review Order
 
W.O. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict T.H. (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was resolved by order TEL-79946-17 issued on June 12, 2017.
 
On June
15, 2017, the Tenant requested a review of the order.
 
The
request was heard in Peterborough on June 23, 2017.
 
The
Landlord’s representative, D.S., and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
THE
REVIEW REQUEST
1.      The
Tenant’s request for review alleges the Tenant was not reasonably able to
participate in the hearing held on June 6, 2017 and the order contains a
material error of fact with respect to the amount owing. 
2.      The
Landlord concedes that the amount the order says the Tenant owes is incorrect.
That is a material error of fact so on that basis the review must be granted. 
THE
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
3.      There
is no dispute between the parties that the Tenant has not paid the total rent
the Tenant was required to pay for the period from December 1, 2016 to June 30,
2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective January 26, 2017.
4.      The
Tenant contests the amount the Landlord claims is outstanding. Save and except
for a payment the Tenant alleges was made on April 1, 2017, the parties agree
as to what was paid. 
5.      The
Tenant says on April 1, 2017 the Tenant paid one’s month’s rent or $1,250.00 to
an agent of the Landlord named M.. He did not get a receipt but he says that he
has had problems getting receipts from M.. In support of that contention he
showed me a recent text message exchange in which he asked for a receipt for
his first and last month’s rent and she essentially refused. 
6.      The
Landlord led no evidence to contradict the Tenant’s testimony with respect to
this payment so I accept the Tenant’s evidence in this regard and find that the
arrears of rent owing for the period ending June 30, 2017 total $3,750.00.
7.      The
Landlord incurred costs of $175.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
8.      The Tenant
also asserts a claim pursuant to s. 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act') with respect to the beginning of the tenancy in November
of 2016 when he was not allowed to go into possession as originally scheduled.
The parties agree that the Tenant is entitled to an
abatement of rent of $650.00 with respect to this claim. This amount shall be
offset against the rent arrears owing. 
9.      As a
result, the arrears of rent and costs owing for the period ending June 30, 2017
total $3,275.00. 
10.   Finally,
the Tenant seeks relief in the form of a conditional order setting out a
repayment plan. The Landlord objects and seeks a standard voidable order. 
11.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it would not be unfair to grant
relief from eviction subject to the conditions set out in this order pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. I say this because the Landlord
led no evidence with respect to the Landlord’s circumstances and the Tenant’s
evidence with respect to his circumstances indicate the Tenant can afford the
rental unit, the down turn in his finances was temporary, and he proposes a
reasonable repayment plan.
12.   This
order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further
reasons shall be issued.
It is
ordered that:
1.      Order
TEL-79946-17 issued on June 12, 2017 is cancelled and replaced by the
following: 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $3,275.00 for arrears of rent up to June 30,
2017 and costs. 
3.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord the amount set out in paragraph 1 above in
accordance with the following schedule:
(1)  $655.00
on or before July 31, 2017;
(2)  $655.00
on or before August 20, 2017;
(3)  $655.00
on or before September 20, 2017;
(4)  $655.00
on or before October 20, 2017; and
(5)  $655.00
on or before November 20, 2017.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord the rent due for the month of July, 2017
no later than July 21, 2017.
5.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord new rent on time and in full as it comes
due and owing for the period August 1, 2017 to November 30, 2017.
6.      If
the Tenant fails to make any one of the payments in accordance with this order,
the outstanding balance of any arrears of rent and costs to be paid by the
Tenant to the Landlord pursuant to paragraph 2 of this order shall become
immediately due and owing and the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant,
apply to the Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating
the tenancy and evicting the Tenant and requiring that the Tenant pay any new
arrears, NSF fees and related charges that became owing after June 30, 2017.
