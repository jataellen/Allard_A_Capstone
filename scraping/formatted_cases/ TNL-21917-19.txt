Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-21917-19
 










 
 
 

TC
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict (‘DT’)
and (‘MT’, the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on February 6, 2020.
 
The Landlord’s representative, RA, and the Tenant MT attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the
period from June 1, 2017 to February 29, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective December 6, 2017.
 
2.      At
the hearing, the Tenant MT agreed with the Landlord’s evidence of the Tenants’
rent arrears for the period ending February 29, 2020.
 
3.      The
Tenants paid $1,438.00 after the application was filed.
 
4.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act.  
 
5.      At
the hearing, the Tenant MT requested relief from eviction in the form of a
payment plan.  MT testified that the Tenants can pay to the Landlord $150.00 a
month toward the amount they owe.  The Tenants therefore requested
approximately three years to pay the amount they owe to the Landlord.
 
6.      MT
testified that her income is approximately $800.00 a month from the ODSP.  The
other Tenant contributes $500.00 a month toward the rent, and MT’s father, who
resides with the Tenants, receives approximately $1,300.00 a month in OAS
payments.  MT also testified that she receives $300.00 a month under the CCTB,
but these payments will soon end, as her child will turn 18 years-old this
year.  
 
7.      The
Tenants’ household monthly income, without the CTB, is therefore approximately
$2,600.00.  
 
8.      At
the hearing, the Landlord’s representative submitted that the Tenants’
household income will permit the Tenants to pay the amount they owe within two
years.  The Landlord’s representative therefore submitted that it would not be
unfair under the circumstances to issue a conditional order requiring full
payment within two years; not three.
 
9.      I
agree with the Landlord’s representative that the Tenants’ household income
should permit the Tenants to pay the amount they owe within two years.  The
monthly rent of $724.00 represents less than 30 percent of the Tenants’
household income.  The rent is therefore affordable according to CMHC
guidelines.  Accordingly, I find that it is not unfair to grant the conditional
order the Landlord’s representative described at the hearing.  
 
10.   However,
I also find that it is not unfair to postpone the first payment until April 1,
2020.  This will give the Tenants some time to organize their household budget
to include monthly payments toward the Tenants’ arrears and costs.  
 
11.   If
the Tenants have not yet paid the rent for March 2020 to the Landlord, the
Tenants shall be ordered to do so, on or before March 10, 2020.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
Tenants owe the Landlord $5,226.00* for the period ending February 29, 2020. 
 
2.      The
Tenants shall pay the amount in paragraph one, above, by paying to the Landlord
$217.75 a month on the first day of each month for the period April 1, 2020 to
March 1, 2022.  
 
3.      If
the Tenants fail to make any of the payments under paragraph two, above, in
full, the Landlord may collect the entire outstanding balance from the amount
set out in paragraph one, immediately.
 
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord rent for March 2020, no later than March
10, 2020.
 
5.      The
Tenants shall also pay the full rent to the Landlord on the first day of each
month for the period April 1, 2020 to March 1, 2022.
 
6.      If the Tenants fail to make any of the
payments under this order, the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Act,
within 30 days of the breach, without notice to the Tenant, for an order
terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant; and requiring that the Tenant
pay any new arrears and NSF fees and related charges that become owing after
February 6, 2020.
