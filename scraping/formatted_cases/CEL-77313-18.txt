Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006










 
 
 

LF
and HQ (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict RPE, RPEd, RPrE, RPaE and KE (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard in Mississauga on August 1, 2018.
 
The Landlords and the Tenants, RPE and RPaE
attended the hearing. The Landlord was represented by YZ.
 
It
is determined that:
 

The Tenants have not paid $4,400.00 of the total
     rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from June 1, 2018 to
     July 31, 2018. Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of
     Termination.

 

The Tenants also owe the Landlords $190.00 for the
     cost of filing the application.

 

The total amount owing is $4,590.00($4,400.00 +
     $190.00) as of July 31, 2018.

 

I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
     in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
     (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from
     eviction subject to the conditions set out in this order pursuant to
     subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.

 

RPE testified that her husband no longer lives in
     the home but she is able to keep up with the payment of the rent because
     she has two jobs now. She requested to be given two months to pay off the
     arrears. I have some concern about the Tenants’ ability to keep up with
     the payment of the rent at $3,200.00 monthly. However, the Residential
     Tenancies Act, 2006 (‘Act’) is intended to be remedial in nature and
     the payment plan is not onerous on the Landlord. Therefore, the Tenants
     will be given a chance to pay off all that they owe in two months.

 
Section
82
 

At the hearing the Tenants raised a number of
     maintenance issues pursuant to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies
     Act, 2006 (the 'Act').

 

RPE gave evidence that the backyard was like a
     forest overgrown with weeds and was so unkempt that a neighbor called the
     city of Caledon about three weeks ago to lodge a complaint. The city issued
     a work order against the Landlord.

 

The swimming pool in the backyard was taken over by
     snakes and frogs and looked like a swamp. The landlord gave evidence that
     at the start of the tenancy, the Tenants signed an addendum to the lease
     agreement which stated that the care and maintenance of the pool will be
     undertaken by the Tenants. There is a city bylaw that the pool must be
     opened every summer and the Tenants failure to do so prompted a report to
     the city. 

 

The Landlords confirmed that they were ordered by
     the city to clean the pool and maintain the backyard by August 8, 2018
     after which the city will return for another inspection. The pool was
     cleaned at the Landlord’s expense a day prior to the hearing.

 

Section 20 (1) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
     2006 provides that a Landlord is responsible for providing and
     maintaining a residential complex, including the rental units in it, in a
     good state of repair and fit for habitation and for complying with health,
     safety, housing and maintenance standards. Section 4 of the Act states
     that any provision in a tenancy agreement that is inconsistent with the
     Act is void. Therefore, despite the tenancy agreement purporting to make
     the Tenants responsible for the maintenance of the pool, I find that obligation
     lies with the Landlords who have failed to maintain the residential
     complex in a good state of repair.

 

RPE further gave evidence that the deck is falling
     apart.  While the Landlord hired a contractor in April 2018 who placed two
     planks in specific spots to repair it, there are still areas of the deck
     requiring repairs and this prevents them from going out on the deck. The
     Landlords disagreed with the Tenants that the deck is unsafe and provided
     a video of the male Landlord walking around on the deck. The Landlord
     however, did not dispute the Tenant’s testimony that there are two
     specific areas outside the scope of the video that need repairs. The
     Landlord corroborated the Tenant’s evidence when she provided an email
     from a deck contractor stating that it will cost $300.00 to fix the new
     hole on the deck. 

 

The Tenant is not seeking rent abatement for the
     poor state of the swimming pool. However, they will be awarded a rent
     abatement for the lack of proper maintenance of the deck from June 2018
     when the Tenants started complaining about the state of the deck until
     August 2018. This amount will be 5% of the monthly rent of $3,200.00 for
     three months totaling $480.00 and will be deducted from the total arrears
     owed by the Tenants. The Landlords will also be ordered to perform the
     needed repairs to the deck.

 

Furthermore, the backyard although unkempt with
     weeds and overgrown bushes, did not prompt a complaint from the Tenants to
     the Landlords. The Landlords were forced to maintain it after the city of
     Caledon intervened due to a call from a neighbor. The Landlord will be
     ordered to maintain the grounds of the rental unit.

 
Laundry
 

The Tenants gave evidence that in April 2018 when
     they moved into the rental unit, the washer and dryer smelled very bad.
     The Tenant informed the Landlord of the smell. The Tenants then proceeded
     to make a rent-to-own arrangement for a new washer and dryer with monthly
     payments of $200.00. The Landlords stated that at the time the last Tenant
     moved out, they hired someone to clean the rental unit including the
     washer and dryer. The female Landlord further stated that the Tenant
     informed her she would replace the washer and dryer and did not give her
     an option to clean or replace it herself. 

 

As the payments being made by the Tenants gives them
     the option of one day owning the washer and dryer, I believe that they entered
     into the agreement for that purpose. Further, the Tenants did not ask the
     Landlord to have the old laundry equipment cleaned before entering into
     this arrangement. Finding that the Landlords are responsible for the Tenants’
     $200.00 monthly payments would be absurd in the circumstances. 

 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
On or before August 31, 2018, the Landlords shall repair the deck
so as to ensure that the entire deck is safe to use and in a good state of
repair.
 
2.     
The Landlord shall cut the grass and ensure there are no
undesirable overgrown bushes on the property. 
 
3.     
The Tenants shall pay the Landlord $4,110.00 which represents the
amount of rent arrears owing up July 31, 2018 and includes the $190.00 cost of
filing the application, less the rent abatement of $480.00.
 
4.     
The Tenants shall pay the Landlord the full amount owing in
paragraph 3 of this order as follows:
 
a.    $1,500.00
on or before August 15, 2018                     (arrears)
 
b.    $3,200.00
on or before September 1, 2018                (rent)
 
c.    $2,610.00
on or before September 19, 2018              (arrears and filing fees)
 
5.     
The Tenants shall also pay the Landlords rent owing for the month
of August
2018, no later than August 3, 2018.
 
6.     
If the Tenants fail to make any of the payments by the deadlines
in accordance with this order, the outstanding balance of any arrears of rent
and costs to be paid by the Tenant to the Landlord pursuant to paragraph 3 of
this order, together with simple interest, calculated from the day after default,
at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding, shall become immediately due and
payable.
 
 
7.     
If the Tenant fails to make any one of the payments in paragraphs 4
of this order, in full and on time, the Landlord may apply under section 78 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’), without notice to the Tenant
for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord must
make this application no later than 30 days after the Tenant’s failure to make
a payment. As part of the application, the Landlord can also request an order
for rent that became owing after the date of this order and NSF cheque fees and
related administration charges.
