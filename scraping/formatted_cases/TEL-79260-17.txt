Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-79260-17
 










 
 
 

O.G.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict D.M.
and T.T. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
At
the hearing the Tenants applied pursuant to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2016 (the ‘Act’) for an order determining that the
Landlord has collected or retained money illegally, the Landlord failed to meet
the Landlord's maintenance obligations or failed to comply with health, safety,
housing or maintenance standards and that the Landlord and withheld or
deliberately interfered with the reasonable supply of a vital service, care
service, or food that the Landlord is obligated to supply under the tenancy
agreement. 
 
This
application was heard in Whitby on May 10, 2017.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s husband, N.G., the second-named
Tenant and the Tenants’ representative, D.S., attended the hearing.
 
 Determinations:
L1
APPLICATION
1.     The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from January 1, 2017 to May 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective February 15, 2017.
2.     The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,500.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
3.     Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from October 6, 2016
to February 15, 2017.
SECTION
82 APPLICATION
4.      The
Tenants requested an abatement of rent of 50% of one month’s rent and the
return of $1,000.00 for the following claims under section 82 of the Act:
a)    The
Landlord collected $1,000.00 extra for the last month’s rent deposit;
b)    There
was an outstanding work order from Electrical Safety Authority (‘ESA’); and 
c)    There
was a notice of disconnect for May 15, 2017 from ESA.
Illegal
collection of money
5.      The
Tenant stated the Landlord collected $1,000.00 more than the Act permits
pursuant to subsection 106(2).  The Landlord stated she did not collect an
extra $1,000.00 from the Tenant and the Tenant’s receipts confirm the
Landlord’s amounts.  
6.      The
Tenant testified she gave the Landlord the money on October 28, 2016.  This is
the same day she also gave the Landlord payment in cash of $1,000.00 for
November 2016 rent and the Landlord issued her a receipt.  The Tenant further
stated the Landlord did not give her a receipt for the extra $1,000.00.
7.      The
Tenant also stated she could not confirm the extra amount paid to the
Landlord.  This statement lends to lack of credibility.  I am not satisfied,
based on the evidence before the Board, and the Tenant’s own testimony at the
hearing, the Landlord did not collect or retain money illegally.  As a result,
this claim is dismissed.
ESA Work
Order
8.      The
Fire Department attended the rental unit in December 2016 and found some smoke
detectors not working.  At this time the Fire Department had the Landlord
replace the detectors that were not in working order.  They also contacted ESA
to assess the electrical situation at the rental unit.
9.      ESA
issued a work order with a notice date of January 17, 2017 and a print date of
March 17, 2017.  The work order listed 14 deficiencies within the residential
complex.
10.   The
Landlord stated she attempted to gain access to the rental unit a few times;
however, the Tenants would not allow her in.  The Landlord further stated that
the Tenants would not allow the Landlord in without being present at the time
of entry.  The second-named Tenant denied this claim, but a copy of a note
stuck to the rental unit door from the second-named Tenant corroborates the
Landlord’s statement.  The Tenant wrote on the note, “I had to step out for some
time. Be back in the next hour.  Sorry for the inconvenience.”  The Act allows
a landlord to enter a rental unit after serving the tenant proper 24 hours
written notice, whether the tenant is present or not.  The Tenants cannot claim
the Landlord did not complete the work if the Tenants did not allow them to
enter to complete it.
11.   Although
the Tenants cannot bar access to the rental unit the Landlord must take
responsibility as well due to the requirements of the Act.  A landlord must
make the necessary repairs and perform maintenance on the rental unit and
residential complex.  For this reason, and for the lack of action by the
Landlord to gain access to the unit, an abatement of rent in the amount of $200.00
will be granted to the Tenant.  
Notice of
Disconnect
12.   The
notice of disconnect has a cut-off date of May 15, 2017.  As of the date of the
hearing the electricity has not been cut-off; therefore, no remedy will be
granted for this claim.
13.   The
Tenants requested an extension of time to May 31, 2017 to pay the arrears. 
Considering the date of this order the standard 11 days will be granted, which
is more than what the Tenants asked for.
14.  I have
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1)
of the Act.
15.  This
order contains all of the reasons for my decision within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.  
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before June 25, 2017.
2.     The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $6,400.62*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to June 14, 2017, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit and less the amount of the
abatement the Landlord owes the Tenants.
3.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $49.32 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting June 15, 2017 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.     If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June
25, 2017, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from June 26, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     If
the unit is not vacated on or before June 25, 2017, then starting June 26,
2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 26, 2017.
8.     If,
on or before June 25, 2017, the Tenants pay the amount of $9,090.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.     The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after June 26, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
