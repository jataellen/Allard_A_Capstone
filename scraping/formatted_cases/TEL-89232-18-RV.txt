Review Order
 
M.R.LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict D.K. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved by order TEL-89232-18
issued on April 25, 2018. 
 
On May 10, 2018, the Tenant requested a review of the
order and that the order be stayed until the request to review the order is
resolved.
 
On May 14, 2018, interim order TEL-89232-18 -IN was
issued, staying the order issued on April 25, 2018. 
 
The Tenant says he was not reasonably able to
participate in the hearing that took place on April 20, 2018. 
 
The request was heard in Whitby on May 25, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s property manager, M.S.M.,
the Tenant and the Tenant’s support person from the J.H.S., G.B., attended the
hearing. 
 
Determinations:
 
The Review Request
 
1.     
The Tenant says that he was
not reasonably able to participate in the April 20, 2018, because he was sick
all day that day. The Tenant says he was violently ill and was physically
unable to attend the hearing location. Despite this, the Tenant says it did not
occur to him to contact the Board to advise that he would not be able to attend
the hearing. Instead, the Tenant says he spent several days calling various
clinics in an attempt to find a family doctor who was taking patients. The
Tenant eventually found a doctor, had medical testing done, and discovered that
he suffers from a chronic illness. 
2.     
The Landlord’s property
manager, “MM” says that he spoke to the Tenant on the Monday after the hearing
and the Tenant informed him that he missed the hearing because he had a medical
appointment. 
3.     
While MM doubts the Tenant’s
testimony, I find that he provided insufficient evidence to dispute the
Tenant’s testimony. The Tenant presented his testimony in a consistent and
detailed manner and I find him to be credible on this point. 
4.     
Based on the evidence before
me, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the Tenant failed to
attend the April 20th hearing because he was sick. I find that the
Tenant was not reasonably able to participate in the April 20th
hearing and the Tenant’s request for review is granted. 
The Landlord’s Application 
5.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant as required to pay for the period from February 1, 2018,
to April 30, 2018. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective February 16, 2018. 
6.     
There is no dispute that the
outstanding arrears owing for the period ending May 31, 2018, total $3,544.00. 
7.     
The Landlord paid $175.00
for the costs of filing the application and the Landlord is entitled to be
reimbursed for those costs. 
8.     
The Tenant is seeking relief
from eviction in the form of a payment plan. The Tenant says that he and his
mother have lived in the rental unit for 23 years. Sadly, the Tenant’s mother
passed away on January 22, 2018. This situation was worsened by the fact that
her passing left the Tenant and his sisters with several large bills to pay
which they were unable to afford. The Tenant says and he and his sisters were
forced to appeal the insurance company’s denial of their claim and this
protracted legal dispute left them with several outstanding bills. 
9.     
For the months of January to
April, the Tenant says he experienced ongoing difficulties because of his
financial circumstances, as well as his grief and the resulting depression he
suffered. However, once the Tenant contacted the John Howard Society, his
situation improved. The Tenant says that he now has a roommate and that
roommate appeared with him at the hearing. The Tenant provided the Board with a
letter from his roommate which confirms that she will be living in the unit and
will be contributing $600.00 towards the monthly rent. 
10.  
The Tenant’s support person
confirms that the J.H.S. is monitoring his situation and has been able to
obtain a lump sum payment towards the arrears in the amount of $1,977.00. 
11.  
The Tenant has suggested a
payment plan that would see the outstanding arrears paid in full within 6
months as well as the new rent paid on time during that period. 
12.  
The Landlord’s property
manager is not in favour of the suggested payment plan. He is not convinced
that the lump sum payment will be made and he says that, over the last 5
months, the Tenant has not demonstrated an ability or a willingness to pay even
a partial rental payment. 
13.  
Based on the evidence before
me, I find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(a) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') subject to the conditions in the Tenant’s suggested payment plan. 
14.  
I say this because I am
satisfied that the Tenant fell into arrears, not due to his inability to manage
his finances, but due to circumstances beyond his control. While it is true
that the Tenant has not paid any rent for several months, I am satisfied that
his financial circumstances have significantly improved and I find that the
payment plan he has suggested is realistic. I am also persuaded that the Tenant
will be able to pay the outstanding arrears because of his support person’s
assurances that she will obtain a significant lump sum payment towards the
arrears. For these reasons, I find that it would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction in the form of the Tenant’s suggested payment plan. An order will
issue accordingly. 
It is ordered that:
1.     
The Tenant’s request for
review is granted. Order TEL-89232-18 issued on April 25, 2018, is cancelled
and replaced with the following order: 
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $3,719.00 for arrears of rent up to May 31, 2018, and costs.
3.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord the amount set out in paragraph 2 above in accordance with the
following schedule:
a)     $300.00 on or before June 1, 2018; 
b)     $300.00 on or before July 3, 2018
c)     $300.00 on or before August 1, 2018; 
d)     $300.00 on or before September 1, 2018; 
e)     $300.00 on or before October 1, 2018; 
f)     $242.00
on or before November 1, 2018; and
g)     $1,977.00 on or before November 30, 2018. 
4.     
Except for July’s rent, the
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord new rent in full on or before the first
day of each month for the period of June 1, 2018, to November 30, 2018. 
5.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord July’s rent on or before July 3, 2018. 
6.     
If the Tenant fails to make
any one of the payments in accordance with this order, the outstanding balance
of any arrears of rent and costs to be paid by the Tenant to the Landlord
pursuant to paragraph 2 of this order shall become immediately due and owing
and the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to the Board pursuant
to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenant and requiring that the Tenant pay any new arrears, NSF fees and related
charges that became owing after May 31, 2018. The Landlord must make this
application no later than 30 days after the Tenant’s failure to make a payment.
