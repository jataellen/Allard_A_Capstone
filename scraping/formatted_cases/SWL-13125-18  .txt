Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: SWL-13125-18
 











 
 

MS and MSIPI (the 'Landlords') applied for
an order to terminate the tenancy and evict CL (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (the ‘L1 Application’).
 
The Landlords also applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant') because the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or a person the Tenant permitted in the residential
complex has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit or
residential complex.  The Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date (the ‘L2 Application’).
 
These applications were heard in Windsor on
February 21, 2018.  The Landlord, MS, and the Tenant’s
Agent, EL, attended the hearing.  M.S. attended on behalf of both Landlords. 
The Tenant’s Agent declined the opportunity to speak with Duty Counsel prior to
the hearing.  While a witness, JL attended the hearing, the Tenant’s Agent
elected not to call him to provide evidence.
 
Preliminary Issues:
Section 82 of the Act
 
1.     
At the hearing, the Tenant’s
Agent indicated an intention to raise other issues with respect to the tenancy
pursuant to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’).  However, M.S. indicated that he was not in a position to address those
issues at the present hearing.  As M.S. opposed any adjournment and the
Tenant’s Agent did not offer any particular reason why the L1 Application should
not proceed, the hearing commenced without consideration of these issues.  The
Tenant remains free to file his own application(s) with respect to other issues
with the tenancy, subject to the relevant time limitations under the Act.
Validity of the N5 Notice of Termination
2.     
On January 10, 2018, M.S.
served the Tenant with an N5 Notice to terminate the tenancy (the ‘N5 Notice’)
pursuant to subsection 62(1) of the Act.  Paragraph (c) of subsection 62(2) of
the Act requires that the Landlord provide the Tenant with options to void the
N5 Notice within seven days of receiving the notice in order to continue the
tenancy.  On the N5 Notice, the Landlords did not indicate an amount that the
Tenant could pay to reimburse them for the estimated cost of repairs or
replacement for the damaged property.  While the standard form also offers the
option of voiding the notice through conducting repairs, the Landlords did not
highlight, check or otherwise draw attention to this option on the form as a
potential means of voiding the notice.
 
3.     
However, at the hearing, the
parties agreed that the Tenant and M.S. had discussed arrangements for the
Tenant to void the notice by carrying out repairs to the damaged property.  As
a result, I find that the Tenant was properly informed of his ability to void
the N5 Notice to save the tenancy.  The N5 Notice is therefore valid.
Determinations and
Reasons:
The L1 Application 
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent he was
required to pay for the period from January 1, 2018 to February 28, 2018. 
Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective
January 29, 2018.
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,065.40.
4.     The Tenant has made no
payments since the application was filed. 
5.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit of
$1,100.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlords.
6.     Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenant for the period from October 30, 2008 to January 29, 2018.
7.     The Tenant’s Agent did not contest the
Landlords’ calculation of the arrears of rent owing for the period ending
February 28, 2018.
8.     The only part of the L1 Application that
proceeded was the claim for rent arrears.  As a result, the order in relation
to this application will be limited to rent arrears and costs only, not
eviction. 
The L2 Application 
9.     The Tenant’s Agent agreed that the Tenant had
caused wilful or negligent damage to the following items in the rental unit:
a.    The sliding door and handle to the glass patio
door was broken.
b.    The back fence on the rental unit property was
damaged.
c.    The glass on the garage door was broken.
d.    The left front corner on the eaves trough was
damaged.
10.  The Tenant’s Agent also agreed that the Tenant did not
repair these items within the seven days following service of the N5 Notice. 
As a result, I find that the Tenant failed to void the N5 Notice pursuant to
subsection 62(3) of the Act.
11.  While M.S. requested compensation for the repair costs for
this damage at the hearing, the Landlords did not request this compensation in
the L2 Application.  As a result, the Landlords did not provide the Tenant with
reasonable notice that they would be requesting this remedy at the hearing, let
alone a specific amount sought.  Consequently, the Landlords’ request for
compensation for the cost of repairs is denied.
12.  While M.S. requested a “standard” eleven day order of
eviction, the Tenant requested that the eviction be postponed for ninety days. 
She explained that she would require this time to pack her property and move to
a new residence.  However, an eleven day order takes these necessary
arrangements into account by not permitting the Landlord and Tenant Board (the
‘Board’) to issue an order for eviction for less than eleven days from the date
of the order absent extraordinary circumstances.  However, as the Tenant’s
Agent testified that her recent full-time employment represents the primary
income to the family in addition to the Tenant’s rather modest disability
subsidy, I find that the Tenant will reasonably require some additional time to
secure new accommodations.  I also find that under the circumstances, a delay
of ninety days would result in undue prejudice to the Landlords.
13.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act and find that it would not be
unfair to postpone the eviction until March 20, 2018, pursuant to subsection
83(1)(b) of the Act.
14.  This order contains all of the reasons in this matter and
no further reasons will issue.
It is ordered that:
The L1 Application
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $9.34*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February 23,
2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
2.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords
$35.03 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 24,
2018 to the date he moves out of the unit.
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the
full amount owing* on or before March 20, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe
interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from March 21, 2018 at 3.00%
annually on the balance outstanding.
The L2 Application
5.     The tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant
is terminated as of March 20, 2018. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit
on or before March 20, 2018.
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before March
20, 2018, then starting March 21, 2018, the Landlords may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlords on or after March 21, 2018.
