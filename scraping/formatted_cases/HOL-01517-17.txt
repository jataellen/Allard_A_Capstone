Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-01517-17










 

C.W.W
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict M.B
and A.M.C.B (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on July 24, 2017.
 
Only
the Landlord and the Landlord’s representative, R.W.Y, attended the hearing.
            
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from April 1, 2017 to July 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective June 6, 2017.
2.      The
Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
3.      The
monthly rent as of the date of hearing is $3,235.00.
4.      The
Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
5.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $3,235.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
6.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from September 1,
2016 to June 6, 2017.
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before August 7, 2017.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $9,260.42*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to July 27, 2017, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $106.36 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting July 28, 2017 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before August
7, 2017, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from August 8, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before August 7, 2017, then starting August 8,
2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after August 8, 2017.
8.      If
the Tenants wish to void this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $13,115.00 if the payment is made on or before July 31, 2017, or
ii)       $16,350.00 if the payment is made on or before August 7, 2017**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after August 8, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
