Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-79563-17
 










 
 
 

K.T.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict H.W. (‘HW’)
and L.D.(‘LD’) (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on May 10, 2017.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s representative, F.O., and the Tenants
attended the hearing. 
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from June 1, 2016 to May 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination effective April 17, 2017.
2.      The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending May 31, 2017, total $2,930.00.
3.      The
Landlord incurred costs as a result of filing the application in the amount of
$175.00 and is entitled to reimbursement for those costs. 
4.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,050.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from February 28,
2016 to April 17, 2017, in the amount of $17.93.
 
a)    The
Outstanding Arrears 
6.      The
Tenants say that the amount of arrears is incorrect. In support of their
position, the Tenants provided the Board with rental receipts from July 2016,
September 2016 and October 2016, as well as a log which they say accurately
reflects every payment they have made to the Landlord from February 2016 to
April 2017. 
7.      The
Landlord says that the amount of outstanding arrears is correct. In support of
his position, the Landlord provided the Board with a ledger as well as a series
of text messages in which he confirms every payment he received from the
Tenants. The monthly rent is $1,050.00.
8.      For
the reasons that follow, I find that the Tenants log is unreliable and does not
accurately reflect the actual rental payments they made. 
9.      First,
there is a discrepancy between the log, the ledger and the text messages
regarding two months of payments – January 2017 and March 2017. The Tenants’ log
says that they paid $1,050.00 to the Landlord on January 1, 2017. However, both
the Landlord’s ledger and the text messages indicate that the Tenants paid only
$850.00 and that payment was made on January 20, 2017. The Landlord texted the
Tenants on January 20, 2017 and said “this is to confirm that I received
$850.00 from you today”. There is no response text from the Tenants that day and
no indication that the Landlord was incorrect in his texted statement. As a
result, I am satisfied that the only payment made in January was $850.00 on
January 20, 2017.  
10.   Also,
at the hearing, there was a heated discussion about whether the Tenants paid
the Landlord $500.00 on January 1st or February 20th.
However, the February 20th payment clearly shows up on all three of
the documents and, as a result, I am satisfied that the Tenants paid the
Landlord $500.00 on February 20, 2017. That being said, there are still
discrepancies among the documents regarding the January and March payments. 
11.   Finally,
the Tenants’ log indicates that they made 3 payments in March which total a
full month’s rent of $1,050.00. In contrast, both the Landlord’s ledger and the
text messages indicate that the Tenants only paid a total of $530.00 comprised
of two installments on March 10th and March 14th. Once
again, the Landlord texted the Tenants on those two days to confirm the amount
received and there is no response text from the Tenants and no indication that
they disputed his statements at the time. 
12.   As
a result, based on the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the Tenants’ log
does not accurately reflect their rental payments and the most reliable
evidence before me regarding those payments is the Landlord’s ledger and his
text messages. 
13.   Based
on the Landlord’s ledger and text messages, I am satisfied that the outstanding
arears for the period ending May 31, 2017, total $2,930.00. 
 
 
b)    Relief
from Eviction 
14.   At
the hearing, as I was considering all of the parties’ circumstances, HW became
frustrated with my questions and decided to leave the hearing room. As a
result, it is difficult to determine what kind of relief the Tenants are
seeking. 
15.   At
first, HW said that he and his family would like to stay in the rental unit and
“work out our differences”. However, after HW left, LD said that they had no
wish to stay and were looking to find a new place to live. At one point, HW
said he would like a 3 month payment plan. Then, HW said he would like to pay
an additional $500.00 which would have the arrears paid off in 6 months. Later,
LD confirmed that they could not afford an extra $500.00 each month but she
requested a 10 month payment plan to pay an extra $300.00 each month. Finally,
LD requested relief from eviction in the form of delay until July 1, 2017, when
the school year has ended. 
16.   Based
on the evidence before me, it is not clear what kind of relief the Tenants are
seeking and it is not clear that the Tenants themselves know what kind of
relief they are seeking. 
17.   What
is clear is that the Tenants live in the rental unit with their two daughters
ages 12 and 7 who attend school in the area. Based on their monthly income of
$2,100.00, the Tenants seem able to afford the monthly rent of $1050.00.  
18.   The
Landlord’s representative says that this is now the second application for
arrears they filed since the Tenants moved into the rental unit in February
2016. The Landlord is also concerned that any delay will simply cause the
Tenants to stop paying any new rent and this will add to the already
significant arrears. 
19.   The
Landlord is prepared to agree to a delay until June 30, 2017, provided that the
Tenants are required to pay the outstanding arrears during that time, subject
to the Landlord’s recourse of an earlier eviction under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 20016 (the ‘Act’). However, based on the evidence before me,
I am not satisfied that the Tenants can afford to pay off all of the arrears
before June 30, 2017. 
20.   As
the Tenants have two school-age children and as the end of the school year is
fast approaching, I am satisfied that it would not be unfair to delay the
eviction until the end of the school year on June 30, 2017. The Landlord is
holding a last month’s rent deposit and that would be applied to the rent for
June, 2017. 
21.   However,
as I am granting a significant delay, it would be unfair not to require that
the Tenants make some payment to the Landlord, subject to the Landlord’s
recourse of an earlier eviction. As I am satisfied that the Tenants are able to
pay May’s rent before the end of this month, an order will issue accordingly. 
22.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until June 30, 2017, pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. 
It is
ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before June 30, 2017.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $1,211.92*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to May 12, 2017, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $34.52 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting May 13, 2017 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May 23,
2017, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from May 24, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before June 30, 2017, then starting July 1, 2017,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      The
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced at any time but upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 1, 2017. 
8.      If
the Tenants wish to void this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $3,105.00 if the payment is made on or before May 31, 2017, or
ii)       $4,155.00 if the payment is made on or before June 30, 2017**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after July 1, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
10.   The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord May’s rent in the amount of $1.050.00 on or
before May 31, 2017. 
11.   If
the Tenants fail to make the payment outlined in paragraph 10, the outstanding
balance of any arrears of rent and costs to be paid by the Tenant to the
Landlord pursuant to paragraph 8 of this order shall become immediately due and
owing and the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to the Board
pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and
evicting the Tenant and requiring that the Tenant pay any new arrears, NSF fees
and related charges that became owing after May 31, 2017. The Landlord must
make this application no later than 30 days after the Tenant’s failure to make
a payment.
