Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-79722-17
 










 
 
 

T.I.L.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict B. (R.)
S. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes
(the ‘L1 application’).
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant has substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another
tenant (the ‘L2 application’).
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on May 19, 2017.
 
Only the Landlord and the Landlord’s witness, T.G., attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
The L1 Application 
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from February 1, 2017 to May 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective April 17, 2017.
2.      The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending May 31, 2017, total $1,960.00.
3.      The
Landlord incurred costs as a result of filing the application in the amount of
$190.00 and is entitled to reimbursement for those costs. 
4.      At
the hearing, the Board indicated to the Landlord that the notice of termination
fails to identify the rental unit pursuant to the requirements outlined in
subsection 43(1)(a) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2016 (the ‘Act’).
As the notice of termination fails to comply with the mandatory requirements of
the Act, the notice is invalid. 
5.      As
the notice was found to be invalid, the Landlord elected to pursue an order for
arrears of rent only. An order will issue accordingly. 
The L2
Application   
6.      The
Landlord says that the Tenant has substantially interfered with another
tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex and has substantially
interfered with a lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord. 
7.      For
the reasons that follow, I am satisfied that the Tenant’s conduct has
substantially interfered with both the Landlord and the other tenant living in
the residential complex. 
8.      The
residential complex is a house. The Tenant lives in a bedroom in the basement,
another tenant lives in a second room in the basement and the main floor is a 3
bedroom unit that is currently vacant. 
9.      The
Landlord says that the Tenant constantly exhibits aggressive, argumentative and
inappropriate behaviour towards the other tenant, towards the Landlord and
towards anyone around him. 
10.   In
support of his position, the Landlord called the other basement tenant, TG, to
provide specific examples. TG provided the Board with multiple audio recordings
in which the Tenant can be heard yelling extremely loudly, threatening TG and
others around him, swearing, uttering racial slurs, and being belligerent,
confrontational and aggressive. 
11.   Both
the Landlord and TG say they have personally witnessed the Tenant conducting
himself in this way on multiple occasions on an almost daily basis both inside
the house and outside in the yard and garage. 
12.   The
Landlord provided the Board with a list of dates and specific examples which TG
had sent to him. The list contains 9 specific dates from September 2016 to
early March 2017, and descriptions of the Tenant threatening, swearing,
yelling, insulting, uttering racial slurs and uttering homophobic slurs towards
TG.  Both the Landlord and TG say that this is not an exhaustive list; the
Tenant continuously engages in this behaviour and has become impossible to
endure. 
13.   In
addition, the Landlord says that the Tenant’s behaviour has prevented him from
renting the main floor of the house. The Landlord says he is concerned that a
family might move into the 3 bedroom unit and then be subject to the Tenant’s
confrontational, threatening and belligerent behaviour. The Landlord says he is
currently suffering a financial loss because he is worried about the negative
effect the Tenant’s behaviour might have on any new tenants moving into the
house. 
14.   Based
on the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the Tenant’s conduct is
substantially interfering with both the basement tenant’s reasonable enjoyment
of his unit as well as the Landlord’s lawful right privilege or interest. As a
result, the Landlord’s application must be granted. 
15.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It
is ordered that:
1.      The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before June 6, 2017.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,856.72*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to May 26, 2017.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $21.37 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting May 27, 2017 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June
6, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from June 7, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before June 6, 2017, then starting June 7, 2017,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 7, 2017.
