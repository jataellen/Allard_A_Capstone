Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-85031-17
 










 
 
 

S.I.(the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict M.B. and
B.T.(the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on November 8, 2017.
 
The Landlord and the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Preliminary Issue:
 
1.     The
parties were before the Board on November 8, 2017.  At this hearing the Tenants
requested an adjournment to bring forward section 82 issues.  The Member
granted the adjournment and issued an interim order.
2.     The
interim order directed payment of future rent for December, 2017 and January,
2018 to be paid to the Landlord and into the Board.  The Tenants paid neither
the Landlord nor the Board in Trust.
3.     The
interim order also directed the Tenants to disclose to the Landlord their list
of issues they wished to bring forward under section 82 and a copy of all
evidence they intended to rely on at the next hearing.  This disclosure was to
be done on or before November 20, 2017.  The Tenants did not comply with this
provision of the interim order.
4.     At
the commencement of this hearing, the Tenants were questioned as to why they
did not provide disclosure by the ordered date.  The second-named Tenant stated
that their daughter was ill and they thought that once the due date of November
20, 2017 passed they were no longer able to give disclosure.   
5.     They
were then asked if they had all of their evidence, copies of evidence and list
of issues ready for this hearing.  The Tenants said they only have items on
their cell phone and asked for another adjournment.
6.     At
the start of the hearings in my preamble all parties in the hearing room were
notified that if they intend to rely on evidence for their hearing they must
have three copies.  This means if they have evidence on a cell phone it must be
printed off and there must be three copies of the evidence.  The Notice of Hearing
also states a party must bring three copies of any evidence a party wishes to
use.  
7.     Section
82 says,
At a
hearing of an application by a landlord under section 69 for an order
terminating a tenancy and evicting a tenant based on a notice of termination
under section 59, the Board shall permit the tenant to raise any issue that
could be the subject of an application made by the tenant under this Act.
[Emphasis
added.]
8.     This
means that a tenant can bring forward issues as the hearing happens; not at a
later date.  
9.     Since
the Tenants were not prepared to present their issues at the hearing under
section 82 and they had not in any way complied with the Board’s interim order,
the adjournment request was denied.  
10.  The
hearing proceeded for the Landlord’s application only.
Determinations:
 
11.  The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from May 1, 2017 to November 30, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective August 17, 2017.
12.  The
Tenants claimed maintenance issues when asked how they will be paying the rent
that is owed; however, the Tenants led insufficient evidence to support their
claims.  
13.  The
Tenants then stated the first-named Tenant did work for the Landlord by
cementing the bottom of the house and laying concrete slabs in the driveway
area.  They further claim that the Landlord was supposed to deduct this work
from the rent and that they had agreed upon one month’s rent as compensation.
14.  The
Landlord agreed that they had discussed the first-named Tenant completing this
work for him, but he said the Tenant started the work but did not complete the
work.  
15.  The
Landlord submitted two pictures of house and driveway.  One picture shows the
side of the house and what looks to be new cement half way across the bottom of
the house.  The Landlord said that the picture shows the Tenant’s work which
was only one eighth of the work.  
16.  The
second picture shows the concrete slabs in the driveway.  The Landlord stated
the first-named Tenant completed 40% of the job and the Landlord’s contractor
had to finish the work.  The Landlord testified that his contractor concluded
the work at no extra cost because he was already performing work for the Landlord.
17.  It is
clear from both parties that there was an agreement for the first-named Tenant
to perform work in exchange for a deduction on the rent.  Based on the
testimony of both parties, I am also satisfied that the payment was equivalent
to one month’s rent.
18.  The
Tenants believe the first-named Tenant completed the work in whole.  The
Landlord claims the first-named Tenant did partial work and submitted evidence
to show the work done.  On a balance of probabilities, I believe the Tenant
performed an eighth of the cement work and 40% of the concrete slab work for a
total amount of $215.25.  This amount is deducted from the amount owed to the
Landlord.
Relief
from Eviction
19.  The
Tenants stated they would be able to pay the arrears in a repayment plan of
$100 or $200 a month.  They testified to having a household income of
approximately $1,500.00 to $1,600.00 a month.
20.  The
Landlord objected to the repayment plan proposed.  The Landlord has received no
payments from the Tenants since May, 2017.  
21.  In this
situation, I find the Tenants’ requested repayment plan highly prejudicial to
the Landlord as it would take 91 or 45.5 months to pay the amount in full.  For
this reason, the repayment plan is denied.  
22.  Also, the
Tenants requested a month to move; however, did not provide sufficient evidence
to support the reason for delay.  
23.  I have
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1)
of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before March 23, 2018.
2.     The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $8,499.02*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to March 12, 2018.
3.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $26.96 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting March 13, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.     If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March
23, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from March 24, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     If
the unit is not vacated on or before March 23, 2018, then starting March 24,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 24, 2018.
8.     If,
on or before March 23, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $9,210.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.     The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after March 24, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
