I.
P. T. I. I. (IPTII) (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict S. N. (SN) and L. A. (LA) (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard in Ottawa on January 4, 2017.
 
The Landlord’s Legal Representative, Mr. A. S. and the Tenant (SN)
attended the hearing.
 
Preliminary matter:
 
The Tenant explained that the Tenants have filed application
EAT-62005-16 which is scheduled to be heard on February 21, 2017. The Tenant
requested that the hearing be adjourned so that both applications can be heard
together. 
 
The Landlord’s Legal Representative strenuously objected to the
adjournment request because he believed that this request is simply a delay
tactic on the part of the Tenants. He explained that on November 22, 2016, the
Tenants had filed a request with the Board for the hearing scheduled on
November 28, 2016 to be rescheduled. He argued that the Tenants gave false
information to the Board in claiming that they had received both verbal and
written consent from the Landlord for the rescheduling when this was not in
fact the case. He explained that the Tenants had asked the Landlord on November
15, 2016 for its permission to rescheduled hearing and were told that the
Landlord would not consent to rescheduling if the Tenants did not pay at least
one month of rent that was owed. The Landlord never got a reply from the
Tenants.
 
The Landlord’s Legal Representative also indicated that the
Tenant’s application scheduled for February 21, 2017 appears to be frivolous
and vexatious as it is claiming a rent abatement of $25,000 for an alleged
illegal entry by the Landlord in February 2016.
 
In considering the circumstances related to the Tenants’
misleading information to the Board on November 22, 2016 with respect to their
request for a rescheduling of the hearing, I believe on the balance of probabilities
that there is a strong possibility that the Tenants are attempting to delay the
process. On that basis, the Tenant’s request for an adjournment is denied.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from October 1, 2016 to November 30, 2016.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October 21, 2016.
2.     
The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     
The monthly rent is $1,430.00.
 
4.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,382.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from September 30,
2016 to October 21, 2016.
6.      The
Tenants paid $1,430.00 after the application was filed.
7.     
The Tenants gave the Landlord a
personal cheque in the amount of $1,430.00 on January 4, 2017, but this cheque
has not yet cleared the bank.  As a result, the amount of that payment has not
been deducted from the arrears as calculated in this order.
8.      The
substance of the Tenants’ application EAT-62005-16, scheduled to be heard
February 21, 2017, does not appear to suggest that the Landlord is presently in
breach of its obligations under the Act and it would therefore not be
reasonable to deny a possible eviction based on subsection 83 (3) of the Act.
9.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before January 20, 2017.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $504.42*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 9, 2017, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.


 
3.      If
the Tenants’ personal cheque dated January 4, 2017, clears the bank, then the
Landlord shall apply the amount of the cheque to the amount owing and payable
by the Tenant.  Furthermore, if the Tenant makes a motion to the Board under
sub-section 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order, then the cheque dated
January 4, 2017 will be considered if it has cleared.  
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $47.01 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting January 10, 2017 to the date they move out of the
unit.
5.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $170.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
6.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January
20, 2017, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from January 21, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
7.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before January 20, 2017, then starting January
21, 2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 21,
2017.
9.      If,
on or before January 20, 2017, the Tenants pay the amount of $3,030.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
10.   The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after January 21, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
