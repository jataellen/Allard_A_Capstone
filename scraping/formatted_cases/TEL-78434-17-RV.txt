Order under Section 21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-78434-17-RV
 










 
 

Review Order
 
 
R.P.L..
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict P.W.
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes and
has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application
was resolved by order TEL-78434-17 issued on April 21, 2017.
 
On May 12,
2017, the Tenant requested a review of the order.
 
The
request was heard in Toronto on May 26, 2017.
 
The
Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing. The Landlord was represented by L.C..

 
Determinations:
THE
REQUEST FOR REVIEW
1.      The
sole basis for the request for review is that the Tenant was not reasonably
able to participate in the hearing held in the morning of April 20, 2017. 
2.      The
Tenant’s request for review is granted. The Tenant was arrested on April 16,
2017, and detained. She was released the afternoon of April 20, 2017, after the
hearing had been held. I am satisfied she was not reasonably able to
participate in the original hearing before the Board. 
THE ARREARS OF RENT
3.     There
is no dispute the Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to
pay for the period from December 1, 2016 to May 31, 2017.  Because of the
arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective March 4, 2017.
4.     The
Tenant paid $2,974.00 after the application was filed. As a result, the arrears
of rent owing for the period ending May 31, 2017 total $1,470.94.
PERSISTENT
LATE PAYMENT
5.     The
Tenant has also been persistently late paying the rent. Since July of 2016 the
Tenant has never paid rent on time and in full. Between September of 2016 and
March of 2017 she was continuously in arrears. The Rent Bank cleared the
arrears then owing on March 28, 2017. Since then new arrears have accumulated. 
RELIEF
FROM EVICTION
6.     The
only real dispute between the parties is with respect to the Tenants’ request
for relief in the form of delaying the eviction until July 31, 2017. 
7.     I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant the relief the Tenant seeks although some
delay is justifiable. I say this for the following reasons. 
8.     The
Tenant has been ill off and on for a while. She produced medical records at the
hearing that indicate in January of 2017 she had medical tests done that were
inconclusive. She was then in hospital in March of 2017 for some sort of
digestive or stomach issue and was released with a referral for additional
testing. In March and April of 2017 she was unable to work for a number of days
and presented sick notes for time off work. 
9.     Although
this unfortunate medical history might support some sort of relief so the
tenancy could continue, the Tenant does not actually want the tenancy to
continue. She wants to move. 
10.  Rather,
the Tenant wants the eviction delayed until July 31, 2017 because moving will
take considerable time and because she does not want to take her possessions to
a new rental unit until they have been fumigated and all pests removed. 
11.  She says
moving will take time because neither the Tenant nor her boyfriend drive and
the Tenant’s bail conditions prevent her from being at the unit unless
accompanied by Toronto Police Services. But if I understand the Tenant
correctly her major concern is that she will take an insect infestation with
her to her new home should she have to move before her furniture is treated and
all pests eradicated. 
12.  I believe
the Tenant is of the view that an application she has filed with the Board will
result in the Landlord being ordered to treat her furniture. The problem with
that is it is not a sure thing that the Board will make such an order so the
Tenant’s hopes in this regard are contingent on future events. As I suggested
at the hearing the sensible thing to do in these circumstances would be to
remove the furniture from the unit to storage, treat it there and then move it to
her new home. 
13.  The real problem
with the Tenant’s request for relief is that the Tenant is currently subject to
bail conditions which require her to live with her surety so she cannot live in
the rental unit. There is no indication that situation will change in the short
term. 
14.  The
Tenant has two children. One is with her living at the surety’s home where
space is limited. The other is temporarily on vacation with his father. The
Tenant’s boyfriend remains in the rental unit where he is packing up their
belongings in preparation for moving. 
15.  Given all
of the above, there is no real justification for granting the Tenant the relief
she requests. She is not living in the rental unit and is already in the
process of moving out. Whatever infestation problem she has can be dealt with
more promptly and sensibly then relying on the possibility that the Landlord
might treat the furniture in the future. 
16.   That
being said, the Tenant is struggling with health issues, her children are young
and in school, and not being able to return to the unit except with police may
reasonably be expected to cause some delay in moving. As a result, I find that
it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until June 20, 2017 pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. This will give the family time to complete the
current school year and additional time for the Tenant to pack her belongings
and decide how to get her furniture fumigated if that is what she chooses to
do. 
COSTS
AND DISPOSITION
17.  An order
shall issue terminating the tenancy on May 31, 2017 pursuant to the notice of
termination for persistent late payment of rent. 
18.  The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $951.98 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord. This amount shall be offset against the
rent arrears owing. 
19.  Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2017
to March 4, 2017 totalling $2.46. This amount shall also be offset against the
rent arrears and costs due.
20.  The
Landlord incurred costs of $190.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
