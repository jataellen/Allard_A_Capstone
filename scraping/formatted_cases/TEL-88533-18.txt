Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-88533-18
 











 
 
 

S. G. O. C. L.. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict A. M. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did
not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. (L1 application)
 
S. G. O. C. L.. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict A. M. (the 'Tenant') because he has been
persistently late in paying his rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation
for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date. (L2
application)
 
This application was heard in Toronto on April 11,
2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, B.
R., and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
THE APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent he was required to pay for the period from January 1, 2018 to April
30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective January 20, 2018.
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $880.04 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by
the Landlord.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 19, 2009 to January 20,
2018.
4.     
The Tenant paid $1,100.00
after the application was filed.
5.     
At the hearing the Tenant
explained his growing arrears on a poor health condition that led to temporary
unemployment. From 2013 onwards he has had five bouts of cancer. His most
recent surgery was cancer in his nose tongue and lip in December 2017. While
the Tenant did not provide supporting medical documents at the hearing, the
effects of the surgery were clearly visible and I believe that he has had a
challenging health situation for the past few years.
6.     
The Tenant is a city
employee and after his 6 months of disability finished he went onto Ontario
works. This situation impacted his ability to pay his rent on time and also his
ability to pay his rent in full historically. He lives alone in the rental
unit.
7.     
The Tenant testified that he
has returned to work effective March 2018 and makes $3400 monthly. He testified
that he understands that he must pay his rent in full and on time.
8.     
The Landlord expressed
frustration with the Tenant as the Landlord had been before the LTB in 2017
with the Tenant as well.
9.     
The Tenant offered a
repayment plan at the hearing. He testified that he could have his arrears paid
off in full by May 3, 2018 after two installments, however the Landlord would
not consent to a repayment plan out of frustration with the Tenant, as the
Landlord had been before the LTB in 2017 with the Tenant as well.
10.  
 As May 3, 2018 has passed,
the Tenant should be able to void this order and preserve his tenancy if he
wishes to, and has the funds to do so.
11.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
THE APPLICATION
FOR PERSISTENT LATE PAYMENT
12.  
The Tenant has persistently failed to pay the
rent on the date it was due. The Ledger sheet provided by the Landlord at the
hearing confirms 9 late payments in the past 13 months. The Tenant attributed
this to overwhelming health issues that were pervasive over that period, and
acknowledges that he will on a go forward basis pay in full and on time.
13.  
I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it
would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the conditions
set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before May 15,
2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $1,472.10*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to May 4, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $28.93 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
May 5, 2018 to the date he moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May 15, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from May 16,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before May 15, 2018, then starting May 16, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 16, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before May 15,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $3,486.31** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after May 16, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
 
THE APPLICATION FOR PERSISTENT LATE PAYMENT OF RENT
10.  
If the Tenant voids the
eviction order for non-payment of rent pursuant to paragraph 8 or 9 above then
the Tenant shall pay to the Landlord new rent on time and in full for the
period commencing June 1, 2018 to May 1, 2019. 
11.  
If the Tenant fails to make
any one of the payments in accordance with paragraph 10 of this order the
Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to the Board pursuant to
section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenant and requiring that the Tenant pay any new arrears, NSF fees and related
charges that became owing after June 30, 2016.
