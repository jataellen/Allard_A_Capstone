Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-05217-18



 


 


 



 
 
DCR (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict PM (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes (L1 application).
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict the Tenant because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the
Tenant's rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date (L2 application).
 
This application was heard in Toronto on July 3, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord’s representative, SV attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from April 1, 2018 to
July 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective April 23, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant is in possession
of the rental unit.
3.     
This is a month to month
tenancy. The rent is due on the first day of each month.
4.     
The monthly rent as of the
date of the hearing is $1,465.92.
5.     
The Tenant did not make any
payment after the application was filed. 
6.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,400.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
7.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 1, 2017 to April 23, 2018.
8.     
The Tenant has persistently
failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
9.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
L1 application – Eviction for Arrears of Rent
 
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated as of July 15, 2018.  The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before July 15, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $1,686.38*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to July 4, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $48.19 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
July 5, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before July 15, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from July 16,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before July 15, 2018, then starting July 16, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 16, 2018.
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void
the portion of the order pertaining to the rent arrears and continue the
tenancy to July 15, 2018, the Tenant shall pay the amount of $4,588.68** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, on or before July 15, 2018 and this part of
the order for rent arrears will be void.  This means that the tenancy would not
be terminated for arrears of rent. If this payment is not made in full and on
time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside the portion of the
order pertaining to rent arrears if the Tenant pays the amount required under
that subsection on or after July 16, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant
possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
L2 application - Persistent Late Payment of Rent
10.  
Despite paragraphs eight and
nine, above, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated as
of July 15, 2018. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before July
15, 2018.
11.  
If the unit is not vacated
on or before July 15, 2018, then starting July 16, 2018, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
12.  
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 16, 2018.
