Residential Tenancies Act, 2006

GJH
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict BG and
PC (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe. The Landlord also claimed administration charges related to NSF cheques.
 
The
Tenants applied for an order determining that the Landlord failed to meet the
Landlord's maintenance obligations under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act') or failed to comply with health, safety, housing or maintenance
standards.
 
The
Tenants also applied for an order determining that the
Landlord substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental
unit or residential complex by the Tenants or by a member of their household.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on June 1, 2018, having been adjourned from
March 23, 2018.
 
The Landlord, the Tenants and the Tenants’ representative, LF
attended the hearing.
 
 Determinations:
 
1.      On
March 23, 2018 interim order TNL-02453-18-IN/TNT-02258-18-IN was issued
requiring the parties to make disclosure; requiring the Tenants to pay to the
Landlord $2,150.00 by March 30, 2018, $2,150.00 by April 13, 2018 and the
monthly rent of $2,150.00 from May 1, 2018 onward on the first business day of
each month; and requiring the Landlord to give the Tenants 24 hours’ written
notice of entry to attend and carry out repairs set out in the C of T order
dated February 13, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenants have not paid $12,382.04 of the total rent they were required to pay
for the period from December 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served a Notice of Termination.
 
3.      The
Tenants did not make the payments required by the interim order of March 23,
2018. The only amount paid by them from March 23, 2018 until the date of the
hearing was $700.00 paid on April 3, 2018.
 
4.      The
Landlord incurred charges of $60.00 for administration charges related to
cheques tendered by or on behalf of the Tenants, which were returned NSF.
 
5.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $2,150.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from August 14, 2017
to June 5, 2018.
 
7.      The
Tenants application sets out issues of disrepair including one burner on the
stove not working, the convection cycle of the oven not working properly
although the other functions operate properly, closet doors missing, screens on
some windows missing, a nail protruding from the hardwood floor in 2 places,
and the hardwood floors being rough in some places.
 
8.      According
to the Landlord the Tenants assured him at the outset of the tenancy that,
because the male Tenant worked in the construction business, they would do any
repairs or upgrades to the property, with the approval of the Landlord, and the
Landlord would reimburse them for any materials or other costs. 
 
9.      The
Tenants deny having given this assurance. However, I find it more likely than
not that the conversation as reported by the Landlord occurred, particularly as
the Landlord gave the Tenants a rent reduction in August 2017 for paint,
although the Tenants never did paint the rental unit as they said they would. 
 
10.   I
find that the Tenants did not advise the Landlord of any issues of disrepair
until the Landlord brought an application to the Board for unpaid rent.  A
review of the correspondence between the parties shows that there was no
mention of these items of disrepair but discussion about unpaid rent and various
promises by the Tenants to pay.
 
11.   The
Tenants called the C of T when the Landlord brought a rent arrears application
to the Board. On February 13, 2018 the C of T issued an order requiring the
Landlord to carry out certain repairs. The Landlord has completed many of the
repairs and will complete the rest by the end of June 2018. 
 
12.   I
find that the remaining repairs are of a relatively minor nature and that
completion of the repairs by June 30, 2018 is reasonable in the circumstances. 
 
 
 
13.   The
Tenants complained that they have not had use of the pool that is located at
the rental property because the Landlord has had it under repair since they
moved in.
 
14.   The
tenancy began on August 1, 2017. The repairs to the pool were extensive,
requiring new parts to be ordered. Even once the repairs were carried out,
additional issues arose which will require further extensive repairs.
 
15.   The
season for using the pool ended less than 2 months after the tenancy began and
has not yet begun as the weather is too cold.
 
16.   I
find that the Landlord has taken all reasonable steps to carry out repairs to
the pool during the time when weather permitted work to be done on the pool.
 
17.   The
Tenants have rented out the basement apartment in the house and have collected
rent from September 2017 until January 2018 and from March 2018 until the
present time. 
 
18.   Since
the outset of the tenancy the Tenants have paid $7,468.00 to the Landlord
toward rent (not counting the last month rent deposit), of which they have
collected $4,950.00 from the basement tenants. From March 1, 2018 the Tenants
have paid $700.00 of the $8,600.00 that they were required to pay to the
Landlord (rent is $2,150.00 per month), while collecting and retaining
$3,400.00 from the basement tenants.
 
19.   The
Tenants’ explanation for failing to pay rent is that the male Tenant lost his
job and was only working on an irregular basis. The only income available to
the household is the salary earned by the female Tenant and the rental income
from the basement tenants, although the male Tenant says he has recently
acquired full time work.
 
20.   At
the hearing the Tenants failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that the
Landlord substantially interfered with their reasonable enjoyment of the rental
unit or harassed, coerced, obstructed, threatened or interfered with them.
 
21.   I
find that the Tenants are not entitled to a rent abatement, as they did not
inform the Landlord of any repair issues before calling the C of T, and the
Landlord is taking reasonable steps in the circumstances to carry out the
required repairs.
 
22.   The
Tenants sought a payment plan to repay the arrears of rent. However they were
not able to propose a realistic repayment plan at the hearing. Given the
failure of the Tenants to comply with the interim order issued on March 23,
2018 I am not confident that a payment plan would be complied with.
 
23.   The
Tenants requested until July 31, 2018 to vacate the unit, should the tenancy be
terminated. They were not, however, willing to pay one month rent for that
extension of time. Their proposal would mean that arrears would be further
increased before they vacated the unit. 
 
 
 
24.   The
Landlord is suffering significant prejudice. He is working two jobs in order to
carry the mortgage on this house and to pay for his own housing. He is
dependent on the rental income to be able to carry the mortgage and tax payments.
 
25.    I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before June 16, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $8,464.08*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to June 5, 2018 and the total charges related
to  NSF cheques tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenants, less
the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $70.68 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting June 6, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June
16, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from June 17, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before June 16, 2018, then starting June 17,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 17, 2018.
 
8.      If,
on or before June 16, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $12,632.04** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after June 17, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
10.   On
or before June 30, 2018 the Landlord shall complete the repairs required by the
City of Toronto order dated February 13, 2018
