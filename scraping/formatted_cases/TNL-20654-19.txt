Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-20654-19
 











 
 
 

H&R PML (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict IG and TB (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenants because they have been persistently late in
paying their rent.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on February 18,
2020.
 
Only the Landlord’s legal
representative, BR attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.      The Tenants did not attend the hearing.  I was
satisfied that the Tenants were served the Notice of Hearing, so I proceeded to
hear the matter on an uncontested basis.
 
2.     
The Tenants have
persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
3.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from August 1,
2019 to February 29, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a
Notice of Termination.
 
4.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,493.07 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
 
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2019 to February 29,
2020.
 
6.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
L1 Application:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenants void the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before March
27, 2020.
 
2.     
As of the date of this
order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the Landlord is
entitled to by $315.21*.
 
3.     
However, the Landlord is
authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the Landlord owes
the Tenants:
$49.97 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting March 17, 2020
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit, and
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     
The Landlord or the Tenants
shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
 
5.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 27, 2020, then starting March 28, 2020, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 28, 2020.
 
7.     
If, on or before March 27,
2020, the Tenants pay the amount of $2,119.55** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March 28,
2020 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
L2
application:
 
9.     
If the Tenants void the
eviction order pursuant to paragraph 7 or 8 of the order, then for the 12-month
period commencing on April 1, 2020, and ending on March 1, 2021, the Tenants
shall pay the rent on or before the first day of each of those months,
respectively.
10.   Section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 applies to paragraph 9 this order. If the Tenants fail to pay make any
payment, the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenants, apply to the Board
for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants. The Landlord
must make this application no later than 30 days after the Tenants fail to make
a payment.
