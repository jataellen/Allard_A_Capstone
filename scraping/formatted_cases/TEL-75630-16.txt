Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-75630-16
 










 
 
 

#.W.P.L.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict D.M.
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on January 25, 2017.
 
The Landlord’s representative, S.A-A., and the Tenant attended the
hearing. 
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent he was required to pay for the period from
July 1, 2016 to January 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination effective November 17, 2016.
2.     
The arrears of rent owing for the
period ending January 31, 2017, total $3,394.28.
3.     
The Landlord incurred costs as a
result of filing the application in the amount of $170.00 and is entitled to
reimbursement for those costs. 
4.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $935.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 1, 2010 to
November 17, 2016, in the amount of $110.43.
6.      The
Tenant paid $1,100.00 after the application was filed.
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
8.      The Tenant
says she fell into arrears because she lost her job two years ago, spent one
year receiving Employment Insurance Benefits and has now gone back to school
under the “Second Career” program where she receives an income of $1,300.00 per
month. 
9.      The Tenant
lives in the rental unit with her daughter who is 26 years old and helps to pay
for the cable, internet and groceries. The monthly rent is $1,062.35. 
10.   The Tenant
also says that she owns a car and experienced some mechanical problems, which
also contributed to the level of arrears. 
11.   The
Tenant would like relief in the form of a payment plan which would see her
contribute the remaining $237.65 from her monthly income and pay off the
arrears in 15 months. 
12.   The
Tenant says that her school program ends in June 2017 and she already has two
potential employment opportunities arranged for when she graduates. The Tenant
provided no documentary evidence to support her claim that she will graduate in
June or that she will be employed once she graduates. 
13.   The
Landlord says they have been to the Board 6 times with the Tenant since 2010.
There have been orders and payment plans, but the Landlord says they have been
more than accommodating and this tenancy now needs to end. 
14.   Based
on the evidence before me, I am not satisfied that the Tenant can afford the
rental unit nor can she afford to pay the now substantial outstanding rental
arrears. Even though the Tenant’s income is enough to cover the monthly rent,
it is not enough to cover her other monthly expenses even with her daughter’s
help. 
15.   Also,
I am not satisfied that this situation will improve once the Tenant graduates
from her program. As it would not be fair to the Landlord to allow this
situation to continue, this tenancy must come to an end. As a result, I find
that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction, subject to the mandatory
voiding opportunity provided by the Act. 
It
is ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before February 18, 2017.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,624.62*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to February 7, 2017, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $35.06 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 8, 2017 to the date he moves out of the unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $170.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
February 18, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from February 19, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 18, 2017, then starting February
19, 2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 19,
2017.
8.      If,
on or before February 18, 2017, the Tenant pays the amount of $4,626.63** to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. 
This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain
in the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 19, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
