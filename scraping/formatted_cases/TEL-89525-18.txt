Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-89525-18
 










 
 
 

X.
C. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict A.
J. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
The Landlord also claimed administration charges related to NSF cheques. (The
‘L1 application’.) The Landlord also applied for an order determining that the
Tenant altered the locking system without the Landlord's consent. (The ‘L8
application.’)
 
This
application was heard in Whitby on April 25, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord’s representative, S. L. C. C, attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
THE L1 APPLICATION
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from February 15, 2018 to May 14, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective March 18, 2018.
2.      The
Tenant’s roommate paid $1,000.00 on behalf of the Tenant after the application
was filed.
3.      The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending May 14, 2018 total $4,850.00.
4.      The
Landlord incurred costs of $190.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to an order reimbursing those costs.
5.      The
Landlord incurred charges of $20.00 for administration charges related to a
cheque tendered by or on behalf of the Tenant, which was returned NSF. The
Landlord is entitled to an order for this amount. 
6.      The
Landlord’s application also claims $45.95 in banking fees for this same NSF
cheque. No evidence was led by the Landlord that supports the assertion the
Landlord’s bank actually changed that amount as NSF fees. As a result, that
amount is not granted. 
7.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,950.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
8.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 16, 2018
to March 18, 2018 totalling $6.06.
9.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Landlord is unaware of any circumstances that
would justify relief from eviction. 
THE L8 APPLICATION
10.   The
Landlord’s application alleges the Tenant changed the locking mechanism to the
rental unit and failed to provide a copy of the new key to the Landlord. 
11.   The
only evidence offered in support of this assertion at the hearing was a
photograph showing some minimal marking of the face of the lock. That is
insufficient to establish that it is more likely than not that the Tenant
actually changed the lock. Absent evidence that the Landlord’s key no longer
fits in the lock or works to open the door, the evidence is insufficient to
support a finding that the Tenant altered the locking mechanism and failed to
provide a key to the Landlord.
12.   Given
the above, the Landlord’s L8 application is dismissed.
13.   This
order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further
reasons shall be issued.
It
is ordered that:
THE L1 APPLICATION
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before May 7, 2018.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,770.67*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to April 26, 2018 and the total charges related
to a NSF cheque tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant, less
the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $64.11 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting April 27, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May 7,
2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from May 8, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before May 7, 2018, then starting May 8, 2018,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 8, 2018.
8.      If,
on or before May 7, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $5,060.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after May 8, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
THE LANDLORD’S L8 APPLICATION
10.   The
Landlord’s L8 application is dismissed.
