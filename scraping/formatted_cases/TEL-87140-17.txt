B.M. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict A.H. (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes, has
been persistently late paying the rent, and signed an agreement to terminate. 
 
This
application was heard in Whitby on February 9, 2018.
 
Only
the Landlord attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from December 1, 2017 to February 28, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective December 27, 2017.
2.      The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending February 28, 2018 total $3,450.00.
3.      At
the hearing the Landlord asserted a claim for NSF costs related to five cheques
tendered by the Tenant that were returned NSF. This claim is not included in
the application and the Tenant has not been put on notice that the Landlord
intended to amend the application to include it. Given the lack of notice to
the Tenant I am not prepared to amend the application at this late date to
include this claim.
4.      The
Landlord incurred costs of $190.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs. 
5.     The
Landlord and the Tenant signed an agreement to terminate the tenancy as of
February 28, 2018.
6.     I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 28,
2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. I say this because the
Landlord is not averse to delaying eviction until that date and that is the
date the Tenant agreed to terminate the tenancy for. The Landlord is unaware of
any circumstances that would justify refusing or delaying eviction further.
7.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,150.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
shall be applied to the rent due for the last month of the tenancy pursuant to
s 106(10) of the Act. 
8.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from February 3, 2017
to December 27, 2017 totalling $16.37. This amount shall also be offset against
the amount owing.
9.      Given
all of the above, it is not necessary to consider the Landlord’s application
for termination of the tenancy for persistent late payment of the rent.
10.   This
order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further
reasons shall be issued.
It is
ordered that:
1.      The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated effective February
28, 2018.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before February
28, 2018.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,283.63, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 28, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
4.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before
February 23, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from February 24, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
5.      If
the Tenant does not move out of the rental unit on or before February 28, 2018
the Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $37.81 per day for compensation for
the use of the unit from March 1, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2018, then starting March 1,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2018.
