Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: SWL-16867-18
 
KC (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict JO and JP
(the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe
(the ‘L1 Application’).
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants because they have been persistently
late in paying their rent.  The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date (the ‘L2
Application’).
 
These applications were heard in [CITY] on
July 3, 2018.  Only the Landlord attended the
hearing.  As of 1:30 p.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board. 
 
Determinations and
Reasons:
The L1 Application 
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent they
were required to pay for the period from November 1, 2017 to July 31, 2018. 
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
January 16, 2018.
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit. 
3.     The monthly rent is $900.00.
4.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $900.00
from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
5.     Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenants for the period from July 31, 2017 to January 16, 2018.
6.     The Tenants paid $1,000.00 after the application
was filed.
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
The L2 Application 
8.     The Tenants have persistently failed to pay the
rent on the date it was due.  Specifically, since November, 2017, the Tenants
have consistently failed to pay the monthly rent in full or on or before the
first day of the month when it was due.  The Tenants made several partial
payments, never fully bringing their rental account to a zero balance until
April 7, 2018, when they stopped paying rent until the Landlord filed the
present applications.  On June 4, 2018, the Tenants made a final payment of $1,000.00.
9.     As a result, the Landlord’s application for
termination of the tenancy at the end of the term of the tenancy on the basis
of persistent late payment is allowed. 
10.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, including the Landlord’s request
for a prompt payment plan, and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction subject to the conditions set out in this order pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
11.  This order contains all of the reasons in this matter and
no further reasons will issue.

It is ordered that:
The L1 Application 
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out
below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The
Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before July 16, 2018.
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$3,746.17*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to
July 5, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit.
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$29.59 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting July 6, 2018
to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before July 16, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe
interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from July 17, 2018 at 3.00%
annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before July 16,
2018, then starting July 17, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord, on or after July 17, 2018.
8.     If, on or before July 16, 2018, the Tenants pay
the amount of $3,140.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy would not be terminated
and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If this payment is not made in full
and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after July 17, 2018, but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.  The Tenants are only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
The L2 Application
10.  If the Tenants void the order for eviction under the L1
Application pursuant to paragraph 8 of this order, then the following shall
apply:
a.    The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenants is denied on
the condition that:
 
i.      The Tenants shall pay the full monthly rent on or before the first
day of each month, commencing August 1, 2018 and for twelve months thereafter
up to July 31, 2018.  
 
b.   
If the Tenants fail to comply with the
conditions set out in paragraph 10ai above, then, within 30 days of the breach,
the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Act for an order
terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants.  The Landlord must make the
application within 30 days of a breach of a condition set out in paragraph 10ai
of this order.
