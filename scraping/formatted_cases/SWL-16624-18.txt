GS (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict MM and CM (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe. (L1)
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants because they, another occupant of
the rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. (L2)
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants because the Tenants entered into an
agreement to terminate the tenancy. (L3)
 
This application was
heard in [CITY] on June 28, 2018.
 
The Landlord attended
the hearing.  As of 11:30 a.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at
the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board. 
 
Determinations:
Application to Terminate
a Tenancy – Tenant Gave Notice or Agreed to Terminate the Tenancy (L3)
 
1.      The Landlord and the Tenants signed an agreement
to terminate the tenancy as of April 30, 2018 and the Tenants did not move out
of the rental unit by the termination date set out in the agreement.
Application to
Terminate a Tenancy and Evict a Tenant (L2)
 
2.     
The Tenants or an occupant
of the Tenants' rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by
the Tenants  have failed to pay the water bill for which they are responsible
and for which a lien has been registered against the property.
 
3.     
This conduct substantially
interferes with a lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord.
 
4.     
The Tenants did not correct
the problem within the time period set out in the Notice of Termination.
Application to Evict a Tenant for
Non-payment of Rent and to Collect the Rent the Tenant Owes (L1)
 
5.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent they were required to pay for the period from January 1, 2018 to
June 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective March 15, 2018.
 
6.      The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit. 
 
7.      The monthly rent is $800.00.
 
8.      The Landlord is not holding a last month's rent deposit. 
 
9.      The Tenants have paid $1,150.00 since the application was filed.  
 
10.   The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $700.00
from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
11.   Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenants for the period from September 29, 2017 to March 15, 2018.
 
12.   I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the
rental unit on or before July 14, 2018.
 
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $1,131.72*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to July 3, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $26.30 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting July 4, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before July 14, 2018, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from July
15, 2018 at .00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before July 14, 2018, then starting July 15, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 15, 2018.
 
July 3, 2018                                                                      _______________________
