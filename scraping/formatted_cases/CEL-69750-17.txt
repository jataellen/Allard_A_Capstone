Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-69750-17











 



 


 


 



 
 

K P (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict S S K (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes (L1).
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant (N5); and because the
Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation (N12). The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date (L2).
 
This L1/L2 application was heard in Mississauga on
October 26, 2017.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s Legal
Representative, R B, and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
At the hearing, the following witness
testified:
 
M P (MP) (Landlord’s father
in-law) on behalf of the Landlord
 
Determinations:
 
Regarding the L1 application
 
1.     
The Tenant did not dispute
the rent owing of $5,700.00 to October 31, 2017 as claimed by the Landlord.
2.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from August 1, 2017 to
October 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective August 27, 2017.
3.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act given that the
Tenant stated that the amounts can be paid to the Landlord within the standard
timeframe.
Regarding the L2 application
N5 Notice of termination
4.     
The N5 notice of termination
was served on the Tenant pursuant to section 64 of the Act.  Subsection 64(3)
of the Act states:
The notice of termination under subsection (1) is void if
the tenant, within seven days after receiving the notice, stops the conduct or
activity or corrects the omission.  
5.     
There were only three issues
listed on the N5 notice. The first related to an incident on April 9, 2017
involving police services.  This was a one-time occurrence and this conduct had
not continued.  Therefore, I am satisfied that this issue in the N5 notice was
corrected.  Of the two remaining issues in the N5 notice the Landlord chose not
to proceed with the allegation of the failure to maintain the exterior of the
rental unit.  
6.     
The final issue related to
an allegation that the Tenant rented the basement at the rental unit. In
regards to this issue, the evidence before me was insufficient to find that the
Tenant has rented out the basement to another tenant.   The Landlord only
suspected that the basement was rented because another person was seen at the
property.  However, the Tenant confirmed that this person is his relative.  
N12 Notice of termination
7.     
The Landlord stated that her
in-laws, who currently reside with her and her husband, would like to move into
the rental unit.  They lived in the rental unit previously and formed
relationships within that community.  Her eldest child is able to care for his
younger sibling, and her in-laws are no longer needed to care for the children
in her home.
8.     
MP testified at the hearing,
and although there was some difficulty with the translation from Hindi, which
is spoken by both the Landlord and the Tenant, to English, MP confirmed that he
planned to reside at the rental unit to be closer to friends and part-take in
community gatherings in the park near the unit. MP also stated that he is
looking forward to mental peace. 
9.     
The Tenant disputed the intention
of MP to reside at the unit.  He submitted that the Landlord’s in-laws have not
resided in the rental unit for two years, and ought to have assimilated to
their new community. Further, he believes that he was served with the N12
notice because he refused to agree to a rent increase proposed by the
Landlord.  
10.  
According to the Tenant,
just prior to the lease renewal, the Landlord approached him for renewal at a
significantly higher rent.  At that time, he refused to renew for another
one-year term at this new rent because he could not afford to pay that amount. 
Then he received a N12 notice of termination.    
11.   The test of good faith is whether the Landlord (or a permitted
person) has a genuine intention to occupy the rental unit for their own use (Salter
v Beljinac 2001 CanLII 40231 (ON SCDC), [2001] O.J. No. 2792 Div Ct). The motives of the Landlord, the
fact that there may be other options available or the reasonableness of their
plans are not relevant to the test of good faith.
12.   Based on the evidence before me, I am satisfied that there is a
genuine intention for the Landlord’s in-laws to move into the rental unit after
the Tenant vacates the unit.  The Landlord stated that when the Tenant did not
renew the tenancy, her in-laws made the decision to move. While the Tenant offered reasonable suspicions,
which are genuinely held by him, they remain mere suspicions. I am not
satisfied that they are sufficient to cast significant doubt on the Landlord’s in-laws
intentions. The Landlord’s in-laws provided the
affidavits required by section 72 of the Act and MP testified at the hearing
regarding their intention. 
13.  
Therefore, I find that the
Landlord in good faith requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation by her in-laws.
14.  
The Tenant resides in the rental
unit with his wife, two children and another relative.  He has not found an
alternative rental unit and stated that moving would not be easy.  
15.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find
that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until December 31, 2017 pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act to allow the Tenant a further reasonable
opportunity to find alternate accommodations given that he Landlord’s in-laws
can continue to reside with her and her family in the interim.
It is ordered that:
 
Regarding the L1 application
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before November
7, 2017.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $5,497.25*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to October 27, 2017.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $62.47 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
October 28, 2017 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before November 7, 2017, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
November 8, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before November 7, 2017, then starting November 8, 2017, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.

the unit to the Landlord, on or after November 8, 2017.
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy to December 31, 2017, the Tenant must pay
to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $5,890.00 if the payment is made on or before October 31, 2017, or
ii)       $7,790.00 if the payment is made on or before November 7, 2017**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
regarding the L1 application only if they pay the amount required under that
subsection on or after November 8, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant
possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
Regarding the L2 application

Landlord and the Tenant is terminated, as of December 31, 2017. The Tenant must

out of the unit on or before December 31, 2017 the Tenant shall pay to the

12.  
If the unit is not vacated
