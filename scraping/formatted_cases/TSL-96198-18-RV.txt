Order under Section 21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-96198-18-RV
 










 
 

Review Order
 
DG
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict (‘TS’)
and LW (the 'Tenants') because they have been persistently late in paying their
rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
This
application was resolved by order TSL-96198-18 issued on July 23, 2018.
 
On
August 7, 2018, the Tenants requested a review of the order.
 
The
request was heard in Toronto on August 29, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, J. XC, the Tenant TS, on behalf of
both Tenants, and the Tenants’ representative, J J, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
            Request for Review Granted
 
1.      The
Tenant TS testified that the Tenants had not received notice of the July 12,
2018 hearing of the Landlord’s application.  She also testified that the
Tenants did not receive a copy of the order issued on July 23, 2018 and only
found out about the order for eviction from an email sent by the Landlord to
the Tenants in early August.
 
2.      The
Board’s records indicate that the Notice of Hearing, with the Landlord’s
application, was mailed out to the Tenants well in advance of the hearing to
the Tenants’ correct address.  The Tenant TS does not contest this point, and
acknowledges having received the Notice of Hearing for this August 29 , 2018
hearing. 
3.      TS
testified that the only person besides the Tenants with access to the Tenants’
mailbox is the Landlord, the suggestion being that the Landlord tampered with
the Tenants’ mail. TS acknowledged that she has no evidence in that regard and
I make no finding on the point. 
 
4.      However
I am swayed by the contents of emails between the Landlord and the Tenants
around the time that the N8 notice was issued.  The Landlord indicated in an
email dated April 30, 2018, subsequent to the date of the N8 notice, that the
Landlord did not complain to the Board.  While it is true that the application
had not yet been filed at that point, that email and a subsequent email suggest
that no proceeding before the Board was being pursued.  The emails also
demonstrate a concern by the Tenants with the Board process and an interest in
being involved.
 
5.      I
find that it is more likely than not that the Tenants, through no fault of
their own, were not aware of the hearing held on July 12, 2018 and so were not
reasonably able to participate in that hearing.
 
6.      The
request for review of the order is granted.
 
The
Review
 
7.      On
review of records of the Tenants’ payments, which records were provided by both
the Tenant TS and the Landlord’s representative, I find that the Tenants have
been and continue to be persistently late in paying their rent.
 
8.      The
Tenant TS provided no evidence to the effect that the Tenants’ persistent
failure to pay rent on time will change in the future.  Similarly, TS did not
provide any basis by which I could determine that the Tenants’ circumstances
were likely to change so as to allow repayment of the now accumulated arrears.  TS
testified that she will be undergoing back surgery in September and that she
was hopeful that her employment income would improve after that point but
presented no concrete assurances or evidence in that regard. I find in all the
circumstances that it would be unfair to grant full relief from eviction.
 
9.      However,
I have also considered the imminent medical issues with which the Tenant TS
will be dealing in September 2018.  The Landlord’s representative submitted
that the Tenants were attempting, through the review process, to simply stall
the termination of the tenancy.  In that I have made a determination that the
Tenants were not reasonably able to participate in the July hearing, I cannot
concur with this submission.  
 
10.   I
also considered the Landlord’s request that any postponement of the termination
of the tenancy be made conditional on a payment being made by the Tenants on or
before September 10, 2018.  This order involves an order for a finite
termination to be enforced by a sheriff.   A sheriff cannot give effect to an
order in which the Sheriff must determine whether certain conditions have been
fulfilled.  Accordingly, this order simply sets a termination date and mandates
that the Tenants pay what the Tenants owe to the Landlord. 
 
 
11.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until September 30,
2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It
is ordered that:
 
1.      Order
TSL-96198-18 issued on July 23, 2018 is cancelled and replaced by the
following: The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated, as
of September 30, 2018. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before September 30, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $2,292.29, which represents compensation for
the use of the unit from July 1, 2018 to August 31, 2018, less the rent deposit
and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit. 
 
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $73.97 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit from September 1, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before
September 11, 2018, they will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from September 12, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before September 30, 2018, then starting October
1, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after October 1, 2018.
