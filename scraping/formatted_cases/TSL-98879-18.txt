Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-98879-18
 
#.G.A (T) L (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict N.R (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The
Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges and related administration charges
(“the L1 application”).
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying his rent (“the
L2 application”).
 
These
applications were heard in Toronto on November 2, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s legal representative, S.K (“SK”) and the Tenant
(who was self-represented) attended the hearing.
 
Prior to the hearing, the parties mutually agreed to resolve all
issues in the L1 application and requested an order on consent.  At the
hearing, I was satisfied that the parties understood the consequences of their
respective consents to the L1 as reflected in the order below.    
 
The hearing proceeded on an opposed basis with respect to the L2
application as noted below.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 application
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from July 1, 2018 to November 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination.
 
2.      SK
and the Tenant agreed at the hearing that, as outlined in the L1 update sheet
provided by SK at the hearing, as of the hearing date, the amount owed by the
Tenant to the Landlord was $1,437.88 inclusive of arrears of rent, NSF charges
and the filing fee.  It was acknowledged that the Tenant had paid the Landlord
the amount of $5,847.00 prior to the hearing.
 
3.      In
respect to the L1 application, the parties consented to a standard order.
L2
application
4.      The
Tenant has been persistently late in paying his rent.  SK submitted, and the
Tenant did not dispute, that the monthly rent for the unit had been paid late
by the Tenant consecutively from July 2018 through November 2018 inclusive.
 
5.      Accordingly,
SK on behalf of the Landlord, requested termination of the tenancy.
 
6.      The
Tenant requested a conditional order with respect to the L2 application.   He
testified that the genesis of his pattern of lateness was his wrongful
dismissal in June 2017.  That unfortunate event, he described, put him “behind
the 8 ball” financially and searching for a job.   
 
7.      The
Tenant explained that he found a job in October 2018 which pays him around
$3,000.00/month.
 
8.      He
pledged that if the Board grants a conditional order in respect to the L2
application, he will pay his rent on time.
 
9.      He
resisted suggestions in cross-examination by SK that he had not done all he
could under the circumstances to meet his financial obligations to the
Landlord.
 
10.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act. 
 
11.   On
the totality of circumstances and evidence before me, it seems reasonable to me
to grant the Tenant an opportunity to save his tenancy by issuing a conditional
order in the L2 application requiring him to pay his rent on time.  I believe
his evidence that he was thrown into financial chaos by the sudden and wrongful
termination of his job, and it took him some time to recover from that impact. 
I believe it is reasonable to allow him a chance, now that he is working, to
continue in his occupation of the unit by paying his future rent on time.
 
It is ordered that:
 
L1 application (on consent)
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before January 18, 2019.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,782.68*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to January 7, 2019 and the total charges related
to NSF cheques tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant, less the
rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $46.55 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting January 8, 2019 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
January 18, 2019, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from January 19, 2019 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before January 18, 2019, then starting January
19, 2019, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 19,
2019.
 
8.      If,
on or before January 18, 2019, the Tenant pays the amount of $4,510.60** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, the L1 portion of this order for eviction
will be void, subject to the L2 portion below.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit (subject to
complying with the L2 portion of this order below).  If this payment is not
made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside the L1 portion of this order if the Tenant pays the amount required under
that subsection on or after January 19, 2019 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this
motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
L2 application
 
10.   If
the Tenant voids the L1 portion of this order by paying the required amount to
the Landlord set out in paragraph 8 above, the tenancy shall continue subject
to the requirements in paragraphs 11 and 12 below.
 
11.   For
the 12-month period beginning in February 2019 and continuing for each month
until January 2020 inclusive, the Tenant shall pay the monthly rent to the
Landlord on or before the first day of each month. 
 
12.   If
the Tenant fails to make any of the payments required under paragraph 11 of
this order in full and on time, the Landlord may apply under s.78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 within 30 days of the breach and without notice to the
Tenant for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant.
