Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-95601-18
 











 
 
 

Z.P. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict S.S.C (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes and has been persistently late paying the
rent. The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on June 8, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord attended the hearing. The Landlord was represented by M.P.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has persistently
failed to pay the rent on the date it was due. Rent is due on the first day of
the month. Since October of 2017 the Tenant has never paid rent on time. 
2.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from December 1, 2017
to June 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective May 9, 2018.
3.     
The lawful monthly rent
increased effective June 1, 2018 to $1,934.20.
4.     
The arrears of rent owing
for the period ending June 30, 2018 total $13,334.20.
5.     
At the hearing the Landlord
withdrew its claim with respect to NSF cheques tendered by or on behalf of the
Tenant.
6.     
The Landlord incurred costs
of $190.00 for filing the application and is entitled to reimbursement of those
costs.
7.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,900.00 from the Tenant and this deposit shall be applied to
the rent due for the last month of the tenancy pursuant to s. 106(10) of the
Act. 
8.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 28, 2017 to May 9, 2018
totalling $32.51.
9.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Landlord is
unaware of any circumstances that would justify the granting of relief.
It is ordered that:
THE
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated for non-payment of rent.  The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before June 22, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $10,203.42*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to June 11, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $63.59 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
June 12, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 22, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June 23,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 22, 2018, then starting June 23, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 23, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before June 22,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $13,524.20** to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, this part of the order for eviction will be void.  This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated for non-payment of rent and the Tenant
could remain in the unit until June 30, 2018.  If this payment is not made in
full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after June 23, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
THE
APPLICATION FOR PERSISTENT LATE PAYMENT OF RENT
10.  
If the Tenant voids the
order above with respect to non-payment of rent pursuant to paragraph 8 or 9,
then:
(1) 
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated for persistent late payment of rent
effective June 30, 2018.
(2) 
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 30, 2018, then starting July 1, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
(3) 
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after July 1, 2018.
