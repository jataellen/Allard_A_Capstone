Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-77731-17
 










 
 
 

C.H.C.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict R.C.
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Whitby on March 24, 2017.
 
The Landlord’s representative, M.Z., and the Tenant attended the
hearing
 
Preliminary Issue:
 

The
     Tenant requested an adjournment because she said her legal representative
     was not able to attend the hearing. 
However,
     based on the Tenant’s testimony, it was unclear whether she had actually
     retained the services of a legal representative and the exact reason why
     the alleged representative was not able to attend the hearing. 
The
     Tenant admitted that she had no intention of raising any issues pursuant
     to section 82. 
Based
     on the evidence before me, I was not satisfied that the Tenant had a
     legitimate reason to request an adjournment and, as a result, I denied the
     Tenant’s request. However, I stood the matter down until such time as the
     Tenant was able to seek assistance from Duty Counsel. 

Determinations:
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from December 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective February 11, 2017.
2.     
The arrears of rent owing for the
period ending March 31, 2017, total $1,485.00.
3.     
The Landlord incurred costs as a
result of filing the application in the amount of $170.00 and is entitled to
reimbursement for those costs. 
4.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,250.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2017
to February 11, 2017, in the amount of $2.16.
6.      The
Tenant paid $1,609.31 after the application was filed.
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction in the form of a
short delay. 
8.      The
Tenant lives in the rental unit with 2 roommates who all share the monthly
rent. The Tenant says that she has April’s rent ready to pay by April 1st,
but she needs some time to gather enough money to pay the outstanding arrears.
The Tenant then suggested a payment plan that would see the outstanding arrears
paid off by June 21, 2017. 
9.      The
monthly rent is $1,485.00 which means that the Tenant is responsible for
$495.00 each month. The Tenant’s monthly income is $706 and all three roommates
contribute to rent, groceries and monthly bills. 
10.   After
discussing the Tenant’s income as well as her roommates income, it became clear
that the Tenant does not require a delay until June 21, 2017, to pay the
arrears. The Tenant then suggested a delay until April 30th to give
her time to gather the outstanding arrears. The Landlord had no objection to
this suggestion, provided that it was in the form of a voidable order. 
11.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until April 30, 2017,
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
It
is ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before April 30, 2017.
2.      As
of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation
the Landlord is entitled to by $3.22*.
3.      However,
the Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the
Landlord owes the Tenant:
$48.82 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting March 29, 2017
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit, and
$175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
4.      The
Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a
result of this order.
5.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 30, 2017, then starting May 1, 2017,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
6.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 1, 2017.
7.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $1,660.00 if the payment is made on or before March 31, 2017, or
ii)       $3,145.00 if the payment is made on or before April 30, 2017**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after May 1, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
