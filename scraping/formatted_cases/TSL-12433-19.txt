Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-12433-19
 











 
 
 

J P L (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict B S (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes and because the Landlord requires possession
of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on February 27,
2020.
 
The Landlord and the Landlord’s legal representative attended the hearing. The Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing despite having been properly served the
Notice of Hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      For the reasons that follow, the tenancy between the Landlord and
the Tenant is terminated March 20, 2020.
L1 Application
2.      The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to
pay for the period from October 1, 2019 to February 29, 2020.  Because of the
arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective November 21,
2019.
3.      The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit and pays $3,316.00
per month in rent.
4.      Based on the uncontested evidence before the Board, I find that the Tenant
has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
October 1, 2019 to February 29, 2020.
L2 Application: Landlord’s own
use
5.      On November 5, 2019, the Landlord served an N12 Notice of
Termination (‘N12 notice’) on the Tenant. The N12 notice states that the
Landlord intended to move into the rental unit and occupy it for at least one
year. The N12 notice sought possession of the rental unit for January 31, 2020.

6.      Section 48.1 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, S.O.
2006, c.17 (‘Act’), requires the Landlord to provide compensation to the Tenant
in amount equal to one month’s rent where an N12 notice is served. The Landlord
testified that he provided the required compensation to the Tenant on January
29, 2020, by electronic fund transfer. (Exhibit 4)
7.      The Landlord testified that he is a Police Officer with Toronto
Police Services and works out of the 52 Division which is very close to the
rental unit and will make it convenient for him to commute to work. He
testified that he is moving into the rental unit as his permanent residence and
intends to occupy the rental unit for a period of a minimum of on year.  
8.      The issue to be determined by the Board is whether the Landlord has
satisfied the “good faith” requirement set out in subsection 48(1) of the Act
which provides: a landlord may, by notice, terminate a tenancy if the landlord
in good faith requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation by:
(a) the
landlord
The
Landlord’s good faith intention
9.      The onus is on the Landlord to establish that the Landlord in good
faith requires the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. 
10.   In the leading case law involving a landlord’s own use application, Salter
v. Beljinac, 2001 CanLII 40231 (ON SCDC), [2001], O.J. No. 2792 (Div. Ct.), the Divisional Court held
that:
the test of good faith is genuine intention to occupy the premises
and not the reasonableness of the landlord’s proposal…
11.   The Landlord provided clear, consistent and uncontested evidence
that he intends to move into the rental unit for at least one year. 
12.   On the basis of the uncontested evidence before the Board, I have no
reason to doubt the truthfulness of the Landlord’s testimony or his good faith
intentions. I am therefore satisfied on the balance of probabilities, that the
Landlord, in good faith requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation for a minimum of one year.
Section 83 considerations
13.   Pursuant to section 83 of the Act, I am required to consider all of
the circumstances in the case including both parties’ situations to determine
if it would be appropriate to grant relief from eviction.
14.   The Tenant did not attend the hearing to provide evidence regarding
his circumstances. The Landlord testified that he is unaware of any
circumstances of the Tenant that would cause me to delay or deny eviction of
the Tenant. 
15.   I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance
with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, and find
that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act. 
16.   The Landlords incurred costs of $190.00 for
filing the application and is entitled to reimbursement of those costs.
17.   The Landlords collected a rent deposit of $3,200.00
from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlords.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated March
20, 2020.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before March 20,
2020.
2.      The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $12,288.00, which represents
the amount of rent owing and compensation up to March 9, 2020, less the rent deposit.
3.      The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $109.02 per day for
compensation for the use of the unit starting March 10, 2020 to the date the
Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.      The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of
filing the application.
5.      If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or
before March 20, 2020, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be
simple interest calculated from March 21, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.      If the unit is not vacated on or before March 20, 2020, then
starting March 21, 2020, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
March 21, 2020.
