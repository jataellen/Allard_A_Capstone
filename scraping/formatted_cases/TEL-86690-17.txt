R.
K. and A. K. (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict K. L. and D. M. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the
rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard in Whitby on January 19, 2018.
 
The second-named Landlord and the second-named Tenant attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from November 1, 2017 to January 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective December 7, 2017.
2.     The
second-named Tenant agrees with the amount outstanding as it is listed on the
Update Sheet submitted by the Landlord at the hearing.
3.     The
second-named Tenant asked for a repayment plan that would take the Tenants to
March 30, 2018.  She claims she collects approximately $7,800.00 a month from a
combination of supports such as disability and Family Responsibility Office. 
She also claims her son contributes at least $1,800.00 of that amount.  
4.     The
second-named Tenant says the first-named Tenant was in rehabilitation so she
was paying his amount of the rent.  Her explanation does not address the lack
of payment since November, 2017.  The second-named Tenant led no documentary
evidence to substantiate her monthly household income.  I do not find her
testimony reliable.
5.     The
Landlord asked for an order with standard terms to pay the amount or to vacate
the rental unit.  The Landlord pointed out the tenancy only began August 1,
2017 and the Landlord has now found out the second-named Tenant is renting
another unit elsewhere.  
6.     The
second-named Tenant confirms she has another rental unit in her name.  She
states the other unit is for her son and his nephew because her son has anger
issues.  
7.     The
Tenants have not made any payments towards rent since November, 2017.  The
Tenants failed to prove they would be able to adhere to a repayment plan. 
Since the second-named Tenant already has another place to live, I see no
reason to delay termination to find a new rental unit.  
8.     I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
9.     The
Landlords collected a rent deposit of $2,600.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlords.
10.  Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from August 1, 2017
to December 7, 2017.
11.  This
order contains all of the reasons for my decision within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.  
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before February 9, 2018.
2.     The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $4,516.66*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to January 29, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
3.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $85.48 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting January 30, 2018 to the date they move out of the
unit.
4.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.     If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before February
9, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from February 10, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 9, 2018, then starting February
10, 2018, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 10,
2018.
8.     If
the Tenants wish to void this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to
the Landlords or to the Board in trust:
i)       $7,975.00 if the payment is made on or before January 31, 2018, or
ii)      $10,575.00 if the payment is made on or before February 9, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after February 10, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to
the Landlords. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during
the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
