Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-88767-18
 










 
 

C.W.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict J.W.
and M.F. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard in Lindsay on March 19, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the first-named Tenant attended the hearing. 
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from January 1, 2018 to March 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective January 31, 2018.
2.      The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending March 31, 2018, total $3,900.00.
3.      The
Landlord incurred costs as a result of filing the application in the amount of
$190.00 and is entitled to reimbursement for those costs. 
4.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). The
circumstances here are that there is no dispute that the Tenants cannot afford
to live in the rental unit. The first-named Tenant ‘JW’ says that he lives in
the rental unit along with his twin children who are both 3 years old. JW says
the second-named Tenant no longer lives in the rental unit and the twins can
live with their mother while he finds a new place to live that is smaller and
more affordable. 
5.      Even
though JW was served with the notice of termination in January 2018, he has not
started looking for a new place to live and he has not made any payments
towards the monthly rent since December 2018. The Tenant is seeking relief from
eviction in the form of a delay for one month. 
6.      JW
says that he paid to the Landlord a last month’s rent deposit when he first
moved in and, as a result, the Landlord will be compensation for the one-month
delay because his deposit will be applied to March’s rent. 
7.      JW
could provide no documentary evidence to establish that he or the other named
Tenant paid a last month’s rent deposit to the Landlord. 
8.      The
Landlord says the Tenants did not pay a last month’s rent deposit and he
provided to the Board a copy of a receipt dated December 31, 2016, which shows
that the Tenants paid 9 month’s rent when they moved into the unit in April
2016. Based on this receipt, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities
that the Tenants did not pay to the Landlord a last month’s rent deposit. 
9.      This
means that the relief the Tenant is seeking would require the Landlord to wait
an additional month while the Tenants continue to live rent-free in the unit.  
10.   The
Tenants have not paid any money towards the outstanding arrears, JW has not
started to look for a new place to live, the outstanding arrears are quite
substantial and the Landlord is enduring ongoing financial hardship. Based on the
evidence before me, I find that find that it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It
is ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before April 1, 2018.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $4,694.26*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to March 21, 2018.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $42.74 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting March 22, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before April
1, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from April 2, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 1, 2018, then starting April 2,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 2, 2018.
8.      If
the Tenants wish to void this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $4,090.00 if the payment is made on or before March 31, 2018, or
ii)       $5,390.00 if the payment is made on or before April 1, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after April 2, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
