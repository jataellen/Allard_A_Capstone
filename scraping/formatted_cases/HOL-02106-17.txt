Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: HOL-02106-17
 











 

XC (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict GC (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed administration
charges related to NSF cheques.
 
This application was heard in Hamilton on
January 9, 2018.
 
The Landlord and WJ
attended the hearing.  The Tenant also attended the hearing.  The Tenant spoke
with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
 
2.    The monthly rent is $2,000.00.
 
3.   
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from November 1, 2017
to January 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective November 21, 2017.
 
4.   
The Landlord incurred
charges of $60.00 for administration charges related to cheques tendered by or
on behalf of the Tenant, which were returned NSF.
 
5.   
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $2,000.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
 
6.   
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 28, 2017 to November 21, 2017.
 
7.   
The Tenant testified that he
has experienced some financial trouble.  His business has been slow lately and
he looks after his 11-year old daughter, although he also stated that he has
“no excuse”.  He asserted that his 85-year old mother can help him.  He
proposed to pay off the arrears in two (2) instalments, spread out over January
and February 2018, in addition to paying the lawful rent on the first of
February 2018.   
 
8.   
The Landlord is a student. 
She relies on the rent income to pay the mortgage on the house and to fund her
tuition and living expenses.  The Tenant’s mother resided with him at the
beginning of the tenancy and even then, the Tenant had difficulty paying the
rent. This is the third (3rd) time that she has applied to the Board
in respect of rent arrears arising from this tenancy.  She has given the Tenant
many chances and has granted him much indulgence.   
 
9.   
I am not satisfied that the
Tenant will have the means to maintain the tenancy.  His expectation that his
85-year old mother will provide financial assistance does not seem realistic.  
 
10. I am mindful that the Landlord is a young
student and that she relies on the rent income for her living expenses.  
 
11. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before February
11, 2018.
 
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $4,091.97*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to January 31, 2018 and the total charges related to NSF cheques tendered to
the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant, less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $65.75 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
February 1, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 11, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
February 12, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 11, 2018, then starting February 12, 2018, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 12, 2018.
 
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $6,235.00 if the payment is made on or before January 31, 2018, or
ii)       $8,235.00 if the payment is made on or before February 11, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after February 12, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
