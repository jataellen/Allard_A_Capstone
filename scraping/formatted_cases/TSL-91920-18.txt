Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-91920-18










 

J.M
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict J.M
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. (L1
application)
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's
rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date. (L2 application)
 
These
applications were heard in Toronto on February 15, 2018.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s representative, C.N, and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Background: 
 
March 2017 L1 application
 
The Landlord had previously applied for termination of the tenancy
because the Tenant failed to pay the rent he owed to the Landlord
(HOL-01054-16).  This was heard by Member Rodrigues on March 27, 2017.  It was
determined that the Tenant was in arrears. Accordingly, the Board issued a
voidable order of termination unless the Tenant paid the Landlord $2,891.12 on
or before March 31, 2017, or $3,797.90 on or before April 30, 2017 (“the March
2017 order”).
Consent Resumption of the Tenancy
The Tenant failed to void the March 2017 order and eviction was
enforced on June 5, 2017.  
Notwithstanding the enforced eviction under the March 2017 order,
the Landlord consented to let the Tenant move back into the unit provided he
paid $4,000.00 to the Landlord.  The Tenant paid $4,000.00 to the Landlord on
June 10, 2017; the Tenant moved back into the unit and a new tenancy commenced
effective June 10, 2017.
N11 and Termination
The Tenant and Landlord subsequently signed an Agreement to End
the Tenancy (Form N11) dated June 26, 2017 and effective November 30, 2017. 
The Landlord applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict the Tenant based upon the signed N11 form.  An order for eviction was
issued on October 17, 2017.  
Set Aside Motion
The Tenant filed a motion to set aside and that motion was heard
by Member Rodrigues on November 24, 2017.
Member Rodrigues determined that the N11 Form executed by the
parties was void under s.37(5) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(“the Act”).  Consequently the Landlord’s application to evict the Tenant on
the basis of N11 was baseless and the prior order for eviction was set aside.
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant
has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
June 10, 2017 to February 28, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective December 13, 2017.
 
2.     The Tenant
is in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The
monthly rent as of the day of the hearing is 906.78.
 
4.     The Tenant
paid $630.00 after the application was filed.
Did the tenant pay first and last month’s rent in June 2007?
 
5.     At
this hearing, the parties agreed that the figure of $400.00 on the receipt
dated June 10, 2017, was in error and that the Landlord actually received
$4,000.00 from the Tenant at the start of the new tenancy in June 2017.
6.     The
parties disagreed as to what is covered by this payment. The Tenant claims that
this amount included his arrears up to June 5, 2017, as well as first and last
month’s rent or his new tenancy starting June 10, 2017.  The Landlord
disagrees, stating that this payment of $4,000.00 only covered the arrears as
ordered by Member Rodrigues’ order on March 28, 2017.
7.     Based
on the testimony of the parties, the receipts submitted, as well as details
from Member Rodrigues’ two previous orders as cited, I find that, on a balance
of probabilities, the Tenant did not pay the Landlord first and last month’s
rent in June 2017.
8.     Given
the amount of arrears determined at that time, being $3,627.12 as of March 31,
2017, the failure of the Tenant to void that order, and the amount of further
arrears accrued from March 31, 2017 to June 5, 2017, it is unlikely that the
Tenant’s payment of $4,000.00 on June 10, 2017, covered anything more than the
arrears he owed the Landlord at that point. There is no other evidence of the
Tenant having paid first and last month’s rent towards his current tenancy.
How
much rent does the Tenant owe?
9.     I am
satisfied that, on a balance of probabilities, the Tenant did not pay his rent
for the months of June, July and August of 2017, and that he has only partially
paid February 2018’s rent. 
10.  The monthly rent is
$906.78 and due on the first day of each month. As this tenancy only began on
June 10, 2017, nine days should be deducted from that month. The total rent due
from June 10, 2017 to February 28, 2018 is $7,892.73 representing nine months
of rent ($906.78 X 9) and subtracting nine days from the month of June ($29.81
X9).
11.  The evidence is that
the Tenant has made six payments of $980.00, $930.00 X 3, $630.00, and
$1003.00.  The total amount the Tenant has paid during this tenancy is
$5,403.00.  The total
arrears to date is therefore $2,489.73.
12.  The
Tenant submitted the following receipts from the Landlord for his rent
payments:
•       
September 1, 2017, paid $980.00;
•       
October 1, 2017, paid $930.00;
•       
December 1, 2017, paid $930.00;
•       
December 22, 2017, paid $930.00;
•       
February 1, 2018, paid $630.00;
•       
Undated, paid $1,003.00.
13.  The
Tenant also testified that the December 22, 2017 receipt was actually for
January 2018 rent, and the undated receipt for $1,003.00 was written
incorrectly. He actually paid $1,030 to cover the rent of August, and $60 of
which was to cover for September, and he also paid additional $40 in cash and
another $100 in November.
14.  I accept
the September 1, 2017 receipt as proof of payment for that month’s rent, the
October 1, 2017 receipt as proof of payment for that month’s rent, the undated
receipt as payment for November 2017’s rent, the December 1, 2017 receipt as
proof of payment for that month’s rent, the December 22, 2017 receipt as
payment for January 2018’s rent, and the February 1, 2018 receipt as partial
payment for that month’s rent.
15.  As such, the Landlord
has met his burden in proving that, on a balance of probabilities, the Tenant
is in arrears for the months of June, July, August of 2017, and partially for
the month of February 2018.
Has
the Tenant persistently paid his rent late?
16.  The
Tenant testified that he has paid all his rent on time but that he did not
always receive the corresponding receipt from the Landlord.  This is partly due
to his impatience of waiting for the Landlord to write out the receipts.
17.  I do not
find this explanation to be satisfactory as the Tenant has been before this
Board more than once before.  The fact that the Tenant has kept the receipts
that he submitted at the hearing as evidence shows that he understands their significance.  They are also
evidence of the Landlord’s practice of giving out written receipts for rent
payments received.
18.  The
Tenant has not paid his rent for June, July, August of 2017, and only partially
paid his rent for February 2018 on the due date, as have already been
determined.  This means that the Tenant has been late in paying his rent for
those four months, in a tenancy that only began in June 2017. I find this
constitutes persistent late payment of rent on the part of the Tenant.  
Section
83 – Relief from eviction
19.  The
Tenant resides at the unit by himself.  He claims he is working and can get
another place any time but needs to remain in the unit until the beginning of
the summer.
20.  I have
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1)
of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before March 12, 2018.
2.     The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,482.13*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to March 1, 2018.
3.     The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $29.81 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting March 2, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.     The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.     If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March
12, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from March 13, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     If
the unit is not vacated on or before March 12, 2018, then starting March 13,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 13, 2018.
8.     If,
on or before March 12, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $3,586.51** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.     The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after March 13, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
10.   If the
Tenant complies with paragraph 8 above, then:
a)     The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before March 31, 2018.
b)     If
the unit is not vacated on or before March 31, 2018, then starting April 1,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
c)     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after April 1, 2018.
