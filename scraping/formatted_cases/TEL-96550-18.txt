Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-96550-18
 











 
 
 

P. D. C. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict J. N. D. D.-W. and B.-M. D. R. (the 'Tenants')
because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.  This is an
L1 application.
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenants because they, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have wilfully or
negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the damage;
and because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted
in the residential complex have wilfully caused undue
damage to the premises.  The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring
the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the damage.  This is an L2
application.
 
This application was heard in Belleville on December
14, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord’s
representative, S. P., attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent they were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2018 to
December 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective November 5, 2018.
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $900.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from November 1, 2016 to November 5,
2018.
4.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
APPLICATION FOR WILFUL DAMAGE
5.     
The Landlord served the
Tenants with a notice of termination under section 63 of the Act because the
Landlord believes the Tenants wilfully damaged the rental unit.
6.     
At the hearing, the Landlord
submitted pictures of holes in walls, damaged carpet, garbage bags in various
rooms, vice grips used to turn the shower on and off, and general pictures of
the mess and dirt in the rental unit.
7.     
Simply presenting these
pictures does not prove wilful damage.  As I stated at the hearing, can the
Landlord tell me whether this damage was done due to accidents or did the
Tenants purposefully damage the property?  The Landlord could not provide the
Board with evidence to show the damage was done on purpose.  
8.     
As a result, the Landlord’s
application for eviction based on wilful damage is dismissed.
SECTION 89 DAMAGE CLAIM
9.     
Section 89 states that a
landlord may apply to the Board if
the tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person whom the tenant
permits in the residential complex wilfully or negligently causes undue damage
to the rental unit.
10.  
In the pictures provided, it
is evident the damage in the rental unit is beyond normal wear and tear
expected.  
11.  
The Landlord will incur
costs of $3,500.00 to repair the damage and/or replace property that was
damaged and cannot be repaired.
12.  
As a result, the Landlord’s
damage claim is granted.
13.  
This order contains all of
the reasons for the decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued. 
It is ordered that:
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below in paragraphs 2 through 9, the tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the
rental unit on or before December 29, 2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $4,463.99*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to December 18, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes
on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $31.79 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting December 19, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before December 29, 2018, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
December 30, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before December 29, 2018, then starting December 30, 2018, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after December 30, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before December
29, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $5,992.00** to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
9.    
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after December 30,
2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
SECTION 89 DAMAGE CLAIM
10.  
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $3,500.00, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing
the damage and/or replacing the damaged property.
11.  
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing in paragraph 10 on or before December 29,
2018, they will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated
from December 30, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
