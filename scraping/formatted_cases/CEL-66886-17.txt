            Order
under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-66886-17



 


 


 



 
 
AP
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict KM
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes
 
This
application was heard in Mississauga on June 14, 2017.
 
Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from January 1, 2017 to June 30, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination.
2.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $800.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
3.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 1, 2016 to
May 9, 2017.
4.      I
have reviewed the information provided by the Landlord in the N8 Notice to End
Your Tenancy at the End of the Term.  I have also considered the oral testimony
of the Landlord that the Tenant was aware of the requirement to pay rent on the
first day of the month.  I find that the Tenant has been persistently late in
paying the rent.
5.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
The Application for Non-Payment of Rent
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids this part of the eviction order for non-payment of rent as set
out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The
Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before July 2, 2017.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $3,757.31*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to June 21, 2017, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $26.30 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting June 22, 2017 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before July
2, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from July 3, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before July 2, 2017, then starting July 3, 2017,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 3, 2017.
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $4,990.00 if the payment is made on or before June 30, 2017, or
ii)       $5,790.00 if the payment is made on or before July 2, 2017**.


9.      If,
on or before July 2, 1017 the Tenant pays to the Landlord the amount set out in
paragraph 8 above, this part of the eviction order for non-payment of rent will
be void.  This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit until July 31, 2016, when the tenancy will be
terminated for the Tenant’s persistent late payment of rent.  If the payment
under paragraph 8 is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this
order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced. 
10.   The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after July 3, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
The Application for Persistent Late Payment
of Rent
11.   If
the Tenant voids the part of this eviction order for non-payment of rent,
above, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated as of July
31, 2016 for the Tenant’s persistent late payment of rent.  The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before July 31, 2017.
12.   If
the unit is not vacated on or before July 31, 2017, then starting August 1,
2017 the landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
13.   Upon
receipt of this order the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after August 1, 2017.
