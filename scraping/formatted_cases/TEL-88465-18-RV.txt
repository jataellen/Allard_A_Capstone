Review Order
 
 
 
C.L.P. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict K.K. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes and because he has been persistently late in
paying his rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date.
This application was resolved by order TEL-88465-18
issued on April 24, 2018. 
 
On April 27, 2018, the Tenant requested a review of
the order and that the order be stayed until the request to review the order is
resolved.
 
On April 30, 2018, interim order TEL-88465-18 -IN was
issued, staying the order issued on April 24, 2018. 
 
The Tenant alleges that he was not reasonable able to
participate in the hearing that took place on April 17, 2018. 
 
The request was heard in Toronto on May 14, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s
representative, F.Q., the Landlord’s site manager, G.K., the Tenant and the Tenant’s 12 year old unnamed son attended
the hearing. The Tenant’s son assisted at the hearing by translating the
proceedings for the Tenant. 
 
Determinations:
 
 
 
 
The Request for Review
 
1.     
The Tenant says that he was
not reasonably able to participate in the April 17, 2018, hearing because he
suffered a medical emergency on April 16, 2018, and had to attend the hospital.
This hospital visit meant that the Tenant was unable to attend work on April 16th.
The Tenant says that, if he were to miss work the next day for the hearing, he
would have been fired for missing two consecutive days of work. The Tenant’s
explanation at the hearing is consistent with his written request for review. 
2.     
The Landlord’s
representative dispute’s the Tenant’s testimony and called the site manager,
‘GK’, as a witness at the hearing. However, the bulk of GW’s testimony and the
representative’s submissions regarding the Tenant’s request for review center around
the Tenant’s ability, or lack thereof, to understand the notice of hearing. 
3.     
There is no dispute that the
Tenant understood the notice of hearing. However, the Tenant says that he was
simply unable to attend the hearing because of his medical emergency the
previous day. I have no reason to disbelieve the Tenant’s testimony and I find
his testimony to be credible. 
4.     
For these reasons, I find
that the Tenant was not reasonably able to participate in the hearing that took
place on April 17, 2018, and the Tenant’s request for review is granted. 
The Landlord’s Application 
5.     
At the hearing on April 17,
2018, the Landlord’s application for non-payment of rent was discontinued by
operation of law because the Tenant paid all of the outstanding arrears as well
as the Landlord’s filing fee. As the application was discontinued, it is no
longer before me. 
6.     
The Tenant has been
persistently late in paying his rent. According to the information provided by
the Landlord’s representative, the Tenant has been late paying his rent 18
times out of 18 since the tenancy began in December 2016. 
7.     
The Tenant says that this
pattern of late payments has been unavoidable because his paycheques from work
arrive after the rent is due and he is not able to rearrange his finances in
order to pay his rent earlier. The Tenant says that this workplace payment
schedule is not expected to change in the near future. 
8.     
Based on the Tenant’s
testimony, I am satisfied that the Tenant is either unwilling or unable to pay
his rent on time and this situation is not expected to change. 
9.     
As I am satisfied that the
Tenant has been persistently late in paying his rent, the only remaining issue
before me is whether it would be fair in all the circumstances pursuant to
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). 
10.  
The circumstances here are
most unfortunate. The Tenant has lived in the rental unit since December 2016
along with his wife and his two sons, ages 12 and 15, who both attend school in
the area. The Tenant works two jobs and his wife works part-time sporadic
hours. 
11.  
The Tenant is relatively new
to the country and he does not speak English. Even though the Tenant and his
family can barely afford the rental unit, the Tenant is not receiving any
social assistance or income assistance or assistance with housing. I explained
to the Tenant and his son at the hearing that he should contact duty counsel
and/or a legal clinic who may be able to provide him with a list of agencies
who may offer him assistance. 
12.  
There is no dispute that the
Landlord is holding a last month’s rent deposit and all of May’s rent has been
paid to the Landlord. The Landlord’s representative says that he would
understand if the Board were to grant relief from eviction in the form of a
delay until June 30, 2018. 
13.  
Based on the evidence before
me, I find that delaying the eviction until June 30th would be fair
in all the circumstances. This delay would give the Tenant an opportunity to
search for a more affordable living space, and it would also allow the Tenant’s
children to finish their school year. The delay should also give the Tenant an
opportunity to contact a social housing provider who may be able to assist him
with finding a new place to live.  
14.  
For these reasons, and
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act, I find that it would not be unfair
to grant relief from eviction in the form of a delay  until June 30, 2018. An
order will issue accordingly. 
It is ordered that:
1.     
The request to review order
TEL-88465-18 issued on April 17, 2018, is granted. The order is cancelled and
replaced with the following order:
2.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant shall move out of the rental
unit on or before June 30, 2018. 
3.     
If the unit is not vacated
by June 30, 2018, then starting July 1, 2018, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (the Sheriff), so that the eviction may be
enforced.
4.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after July 1, 2018.
