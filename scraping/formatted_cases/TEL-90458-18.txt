Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-90458-18
 











 
 
 

Numbered Company (F.M.) (the 'Landlord') applied for
an order to terminate the tenancy and evict L.O.E. (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on May 30, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, B.R.,
and the Tenant attended the hearing. 
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent he was required to pay for the period from March 1, 2018 to May 31,
2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective March 27, 2018.
2.     
The outstanding arrears
owing for the period ending May 31, 2018, total $3,651.62. 
3.     
The Landlord paid $190.00
for the costs of filing the application and the Landlord is entitled to be
reimbursed for those costs. 
4.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,223.73 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from March 1, 2018 to March 27, 2018, in
the amount of $1.63.
6.     
The Tenant has been living
alone in the rental unit for approximately 3 years. The Tenant is seeking
relief from eviction in the form of a payment plan that would see the
outstanding arrears paid in full within 6 months. 
7.     
After discussing the
Tenant’s monthly income and expenses, it appears that the Tenant can afford
this payment plan. However, for the following reasons, I do not find the Tenant
to be credible regarding his monthly income and expenses. 
8.     
I say this because, at the
hearing, the Tenant was not forthcoming in response to my questions about his
monthly expenses. First, the Tenant failed to tell me the accurate amount of
his monthly child support payments. The Tenant only provided me with an
accurate amount reluctantly and after already providing extensive testimony.
Also, the Tenant was not forthcoming with the amount of his child support
arrears. The Tenant failed to mention these arrears but instead said that he
“had some trouble with child support”. After extensive questioning and evasive
answers, the Tenant finally admitted that he owes child support arrears in the
amount of $8,000.00 in addition to the almost $4,000.00 in rent arrears in the
application before me. 
9.     
As the Tenant failed to
admit this important fact and as the Tenant was extremely evasive during my
questioning about this fact, I find the remainder of his testimony regarding
his income and expenses not to be credible. 
10.  
As the Tenant’s testimony is
not credible, he has disentitled himself to any discretionary relief from
eviction that the Board may grant to him. I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before June 17,
2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $2,697.67*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to June 6, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $40.23 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
June 7, 2018 to the date he moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 17, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June 18,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 17, 2018, then starting June 18, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 18, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before June 17,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $5,065.35** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after June 18, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
