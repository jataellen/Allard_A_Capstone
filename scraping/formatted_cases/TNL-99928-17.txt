Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-99928-17



 


 


 



 
WA
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict MA and
MG (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe.
 
This
application was heard in Newmarket on January 29, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from May 15, 2017 to February 14, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective November 25, 2017.
2.     The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,000.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
3.     Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from June 16, 2010
to November 25, 2017.
4.     The
Tenants paid $1,000.00 after the application was filed.
5.     The
Tenants are spouses and live in the rental unit with their 4 young children. 
They have lived in the unit for 7 years.  They testified that the husband’s
earnings were reduced and were not enough to permit them to pay the rent.  They
testified that he had started a new job at the beginning of December which
would provide higher income.  They state that they can pay the arrears by
paying $600 monthly starting on February 28th and monthly thereafter
on the 28th of each month until the arrears are paid, and that they
can pay the ongoing rent when it becomes due on the 15th of each
month starting on February 15th.
6.     The
Landlord opposes the payment plan suggested by the Tenants, saying it is over
much too long a period of time.  He states that, although he has not previously
brought applications to the Board, the Tenants have repeatedly been late in the
payment of their rent, and have repeatedly broken promises to rectify this
problem.  He states that he is a small landlord who lives upstairs in the house
in which the rental unit is located, and that he can no longer afford to allow
such substantial arrears and late payments.  He seeks a standard termination
order.
7.     The
Tenants have paid only $1,400 of rent since May 15th.  As a result
the arrears have increased substantially, so that the amount now owing is more
than $8,500.00, which is more than 7 months’ rent.  Even though the male Tenant
has been working full-time since the beginning of December, they paid only
$1,000.00 shortly before the hearing.  They provided no details or supporting
documentation about the new job the male Tenant claims to have started, or
about the income from that job. The payment plan proposed by the Tenants does
not provide for any payment toward the arrears until the end of February, and
would take almost 15 months before the arrears are repaid.  
8.     I
am not satisfied that the payment plan is sustainable, and even if it is
sustainable, it is unfair to the Landlord to require that he wait so long to
have the amount owing paid.  He is a small landlord who rents his basement to
the Tenants and depends on receipt of the income, and should be entitled to
expect payment of the rent when it is due.   Although there have been no
previous applications or Board orders, the Tenants did not dispute the
Landlord’s evidence that the failure to pay the rent when it is due is not a
new problem, and that the Tenants have been given opportunities to remedy this
situation but have not done so.  While I take into consideration the duration
of the tenancy and the fact that young children are affected by a termination,
the Board is required to be fair to both parties.
9.     I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.  However, I find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act until February
28, 2018 in order to give the Tenants some time to find new accommodation and
to move.  This is a long tenancy and the Landlord is holding a deposit for the
last month’s rent.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before February 28, 2018.
2.     The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $6,891.67*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to January 31, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $36.16 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 1, 2018 to the date they move out of the
unit.
4.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.     If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
February 11, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from February 12, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.     If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2018, then starting March 1,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2018.
8.     If
the Tenants wish to void this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)       $8,690.00 if the payment is made on or before February 14, 2018, or
ii)      $9,790.00 if the payment is made on or before February 28, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after March 1, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
