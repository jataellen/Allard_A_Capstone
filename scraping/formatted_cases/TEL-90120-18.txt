S.S. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict T.M. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on May 9, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from February 1, 2018
to May 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination (‘Notice’) effective April 6, 2018.
2.    
At the commencement of the hearing
the Tenant brought forward a preliminary issue regarding the Notice stating the
rental periods claimed are incorrect.  She submitted a copy of order
TEL-88723-18, which dismissed the Landlord’s previous application before the
Board because the Landlord did not claim the correct rent arrears when the
Notice was created.  The Tenant believed this Notice should also be deemed
invalid due to the incorrect rental periods listed on the Notice.
3.    
The issue with the
Landlord’s previous application was that she applied the last month’s rent
deposit to the month of August 2017 because she believed the Tenant was
vacating.  The Tenant did not vacate; therefore, the rent for August 2017 was
owed to the Landlord.  The Tenant also submitted a copy of payment for February
2018 in the amount of one month’s rent.  This payment was made as a direct
deposit into the Landlord’s bank account and did not allocate the payment.
4.    
The Landlord stated that she
did receive the payment, but she applied it to the month of August 2017.  Aside
from this allocation, the Notice indicates there were two month’s rent
outstanding at the time the Landlord created the Notice on March 23, 2018.  
5.    
Since the Notice correctly
reflected the amount the Tenant was required to pay to void the Notice, I see
no fatal flaw in the Notice.  
6.    
While reviewing the Update
Sheet provided by the Landlord at the hearing, I asked about the lack of last
month’s rent deposit claimed on the application.  The Landlord stated that a
last month’s rent deposit was given and should be accounted for in the
application.  At this time the application was amended to include the deposit
appropriately.
7.    
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,400.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
8.    
The Tenant requested a
repayment plan beginning May 25, 2018 with a large sum of $2,800.00 to be paid
to the Landlord and $500.00 each month with the monthly rent until the arrears
are paid in full.  The Tenant lost her job and had a death in the family, but she
is now working again.  She also is a single mother of two children: 18 month
old and 8 year old.  
9.    
The Landlord objected to
this repayment plan stating she has trouble financially when the Tenant does
not pay her rent.  The Landlord admittedly said that her mortgage is up to date
at this time.  The Tenant then countered with a repayment plan that would have
$600.00 paid with the monthly rent.
10.  The Landlord failed to provide sufficient
evidence to persuade me to deny the Tenant’s repayment plan.  I find the Tenant’s
repayment plan to be reasonable and it is granted.
11.  I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. 
12.  This order contains all of the reasons for the
decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $5,790.00 for arrears of rent up to May 31, 2018 and costs.
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord the amount set out above in paragraph 1 in accordance with the
following schedule: 
a)   
$2,800.00 on or before May
25, 2018;
b)   
$600.00 on or before June 1,
2018;
c)   
$600.00 on or before July 1,
2018;
d)   
$600.00 on or before August
1, 2018;
e)   
$600.00 on or before
September 1, 2018; and
f)    
$590.00 on or before October
1, 2018.
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay
the monthly rent on or before the first day of every month beginning June 1,
2018 until October 1, 2018. 
4.    
If the Tenant fails to make
any one of the payments in accordance with this order, the outstanding balance
of any arrears of rent and costs to be paid by the Tenant to the Landlord
pursuant to paragraph 1 of this order shall become immediately due and owing
and the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to the Board pursuant
to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenant and requiring that the Tenant pay any new arrears, NSF fees and related
charges that became owing after May 31, 2018.
