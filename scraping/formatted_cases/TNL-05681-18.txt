Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-05681-18



 


 


 



 
RPMS (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict KB andNB (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent
that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on July 12, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, BR and the first
named Tenant’s mother, (RB) attended the hearing on behalf of the Tenants. 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from May 1, 2018
to July 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective May 30, 2018.
2.     
The monthly rent as of the
date of the hearing is $1,310.03.
3.     
There was no dispute that
the Tenants owe the Landlord the amount of $3,520.00, which represents the
arrears to July 31, 2018, and the application filing fee.
4.     
The Tenants have lived in
the unit for approximately six years. The Tenants have four children, age six
to twelve. 
5.     
It was the evidence of the
Tenant’s representative, RB that the Tenants have encountered some financial
difficulties. She explained that the Tenants hydro was cut-off and they had to
pay that along with other expenses. They incurred additional expenses when
their ten your old child was ill and they had to pay for a taxi back and forth
to the hospital. Also, their twelve year old child had to go to the hospital a
month ago because the child’s chest caved in.
6.     
The Tenants requested relief
and proposed a payment plan for the arrears that would have the arrears paid in
several months; and the rent paid when due.
7.     
The Landlord requested a standard order and
submitted that the Tenants have not paid any rent in over three months; and did
not provide any medical documents about their ill children. The Landlord
submitted that the plan is too long and unfair that the Landlord has to wait
for several months for the arrears to be paid.  
8.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. I considered the length
of the tenancy and the Tenants’ family situation and will give the Tenants an
opportunity to continue the tenancy if they pay the arrears according to the
plan they proposed.  .   
9.     
In the event that I granted the Tenants’ payment
plan, I explained to the Tenants’ representative that the Tenants must pay the
arrears in accordance with their plan. I also explained section 78 of the Act
and the consequences if the Tenants failed to pay the arrears and the rent when
due. I am satisfied that the Tenants’ representative understood the
consequences of not complying with the order.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Tenants shall pay the
Landlord $3,520.00, which represents the arrears of rent owing up to July 31,
2018 ($3,330.00), plus the Landlord’s application filing fee ($190.00).
2.     
The Tenants shall pay the
amount set out in paragraph one, according to the following schedule:
                      On or before July 20, 2018
             $    520.00      
                      On or before August 20,
2018                     $    500.00
                      On or before September 20,
2018             $    500.00                  
                      On or before October 20,
2018                   $    500.00
                      On or before November 20,
2018               $    500.00
                      On or before December 20,
2018              $    500.00
                      On or before January 20,
2019                   $    500.00
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
the monthly rent as it comes due on or before August 1, 2018, September 1, 2018,
October 1, 2018, November 1, 2018, December 1, 2018, and January 1, 2019.
4.     
If the Tenants fail to make
the payments under paragraph two, above in full, the Landlord may collect the
entire outstanding balance from the amount set out in paragraph one,
immediately. 
5.     
If the Tenants fail to make
payments under paragraphs two, or three, above in full and on time, the
Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
within 30 days of the breach, without notice to the Tenants, for an order
terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants; and requiring that the Tenants
pay any new arrears and NSF fees and related charges that become owing after
July 31, 2018.
