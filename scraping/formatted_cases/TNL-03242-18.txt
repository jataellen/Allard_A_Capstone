            Order under Section 69
 
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-03242-18



 
 


 


 



 
IMH (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict HT (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on May 25, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, HL,
and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from March 1, 2018 to
May 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective March 19, 2018.
 
2.     
The Landlord incurred charges
of $11.24 for cheques tendered by or on behalf of the Tenant, which were
returned NSF.
 
3.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,192.27 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
 
4.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2018 to March 19, 2018.
 
5.     
At the first hearing for
this application, on April 17, 2018, the Tenant raised a number of maintenance
issues pursuant to s. 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act').  The matter was adjourned in order to give the Tenant time to disclose
all the issues he intended to raise to the Landlord, in addition to providing
the Landlord with any evidence he planned to present at the hearing.  The
parties were issued with an Interim Order dated April 17, 2018, TNL-03242-18, to
mutually disclose evidence pertaining to the s. 82 claim, as well as order the
Tenant to pay the full rent going forward until all issues were resolved.  He
failed to disclose all the issues to the Landlord in the intervening period,
and he paid the rent for May, 2018, one week late.  The Tenant failed to comply
with the Order of the Board.  Consequently, the Landlord’s representative was
unprepared to defend the Tenant’s s.82 claims.
6.     
The Board must permit a
Tenant to raise s.82 issues on an L1 application.  Mindful of this legislative
requirement, the proceeding was adjourned to give the Tenant the opportunity to
effectively raise the issues and to allow the Landlord an adequate opportunity
to respond.  The Tenant’s own failure to comply with the Board’s Interim Order
has placed him in the unfortunate position of not being able to proceed with
his s.82 issues.  Had the Tenant complied with the Interim Order, both parties
would have been prepared to proceed, and the Board would have been compelled to
determine the s.82 issues raised.  The parties were simply not ready to
proceed.  Hearing the s.82 issues would have been particularly prejudicial to
the Landlord who was not given the required disclosure, in spite of the Tenant
being ordered to do so.
 
7.     
Because the matter was
previously adjourned for the purpose of allowing the Tenant the opportunity to
proceed with his s.82 issues, and because of the Tenant’s failure to comply
with an Interim Order of the Board, the financial prejudice of further delay to
the Landlord, the Board’s obligation to conduct its proceedings in an
expeditious manner pursuant to s.183 of the Act, and the Tenant’s entitlement
to bring his s.82 issues to the Board through a separate application pursuant
to s.29, I determined it would be fair to proceed with the arrears application
only.  The Tenant was informed that he could bring a separate application to
the Board for a determination of his s.82 issues should he wish to do so.
8.     
With respect to the arrears
owing, the Tenant explained that he stopped working three weeks ago because of
a knee injury.  He has been unable to pay the rent because of that, however he
proposed a payment plan whereby he would pay full rent plus half the arrears by
July 1, 2018, and then full rent going forward, paying the other half of the
arrears by September 1, 2018.  He testified that when he was working, he was
earning approximately $3,000.00 per month, and had no problem paying the rent. 
He does deliveries for his work, and his injury has made it impossible for him
to work currently.  He has lived in the unit for three years on his own.  He
has not considered moving from the unit, and explained that he would need a bit
more time than the 11 days of a standard termination order if he had to pay the
full amount of arrears, or if he were required to move.
 
9.     
The Landlord’s
representative sought a standard termination order. He submitted that the
Tenant testified that he had not been able to work for the last three weeks,
but provided no explanation for why he had not paid the rent since March,
2018.  He was concerned that the Tenant was not currently working, and the
Tenant himself said that he did not have any idea when he would return to
work.  Therefore, the Tenant’s payment plan proposal was not realistic nor
sustainable, and the Landlord would be severely prejudiced by further months
without rent.
10.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').  In particular, I find that the Tenant’s
payment plan proposal is not realistic considering that he is not currently
working and does not know when he will return to work.  He has only been able
to pay the rent for one month in the last three.  However, with his current
injury and employment situation, the Tenant will need a bit more time to find
alternative accommodation, so I find that it would not be unfair to postpone
the eviction until June 30, 2018, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before June 30,
2018.
 
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $1,182.43*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to May 30, 2018 and the total charges related to NSF cheques tendered to the
Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $39.20 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
May 31, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 10, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June 11,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 30, 2018, then starting July 1, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 1, 2018.
 
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $2,563.94 if the payment is made on or before May 31, 2018, or
ii)       $3,756.21 if the payment is made on or before June 30, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after July 1, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
