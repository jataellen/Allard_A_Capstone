Review Order
 
 
M. M. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict C. M. and Steve Parks (the 'Tenants') because
they have been persistently late in paying their rent. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard in Peterborough on
September 12, 2019. Only the Landlord and her
property manager, A.B., attended the hearing.
 
This application was resolved by order TEL-02564-19
issued on September 16, 2019.
 
On September 20, 2019, the Tenants
requested a review of the order and that the order be
stayed until the request to review the order is resolved.
 
On September 23, 2019 interim order TEL-02564-19 -IN
was issued, staying the order issued on September 16, 2019.
 
The request was heard in
Peterborough on October 24, 2019.
 
The Landlord’s daughter, S. M.,
and the Tenants attended the hearing. 
 
 Determinations:
 
            REQUEST FOR REVIEW 
 
1.     
The Tenants
testified that the reason they did not attend the hearing on September 12, 2019
is because the first-named Tenant was sick and, in the hospital, and the
second-named Tenant was at home with the children because they were sick on the
day of the hearing. The Tenants testified that they called the Board and
advised that they could not attend the hearing on that day. 
2.     
The Landlord opposed the
request for review as there was no medical documentation provided by the Tenants
to support their claim. Further, the second-named Tenant’s mother lives in the building
as well and the Landlord took the position that the mother could have taken
care of the children. Finally, the Landlord believes this is a delay tactic on
the part of the Tenants as there have been no further payments made to
the Landlord in good faith.  
3.     
The Board’s records show
that at 8:57am on September 12, 2019, the first-named Tenant called the Board advising
she was in the hospital on IV fluids and unable to attend the hearing. The
whereabouts of the second-named Tenant are unclear, but I granted the request
for review out of an abundance of caution and because I find that the
first-named Tenant genuinely intended to participate at the hearing on
September 12, 2019 but was unable to due to her hospitalization. 
4.     
Therefore, order TEL-02564-19 is cancelled and the Landlord’s application was
heard de novo on October 24, 2019.
L2
APPLICATION FOR PERSISTENT LATE PAYMENT OF RENT
5.     
This is a month-to-month
tenancy in which rent is due on the first of the month. 
6.     
The Landlord’s L2
application is based on a N8 notice of termination served to the Tenants
on April 30, 2019 with a termination date of June 30, 2019 alleging persistent
late payment of rent for the period from September 2018 through to April 2019. 
7.     
Since the N8 notice of
termination was served, the Tenants have continued to pay the rent late for the
months of May 2019 and June 2019 and have not made any further payments to the Landlord
as of the hearing date of October 24, 2019. 
8.     
The Landlord seeks
termination of the tenancy and reimbursement of the $175.00 application filing
fee. 
TENANT’S REQUEST FOR RELIEF
9.     
The Tenants do not
dispute that the rent has been persistently paid late for the time period
alleged on the notice of termination. 
10.  
They explained that they
obtained full custody of their children effective September 2018 which resulted
in an increase in expenses. Further, the second-named Tenant was laid off in
October 2018 and paid rent when he received his Employment Insurance benefits
which was thereafter depleted. 
11.  
The Tenants began receiving
the Child Tax Benefit effective February 2019 which resulted in catching up on
all outstanding bills except for the rent. Then, the second-named Tenant began
to receive Ontario Works benefits effective July 2019, but a month later their
dog passed away which caused further financial hardship. 
12.  
The first-named Tenant is
not employed as she is a stay-at-home mom who takes care of her children and
her mother-in-law. The second-named Tenant is currently unemployed. 
13.  
The total household income
for the Tenants is $2,248.00 which is inclusive of the Child Tax
Benefit and Ontario Works benefits. The Tenants total expenses are $2,763.57 which is inclusive
of their pet bill, phone bill, rent, utilities bill, car insurance payments,
gas expense and groceries. This puts the Tenant at a negative monthly balance of
$515.57. The Tenants testified that their pet expense will be paid
off in four months, at which point they could pay additional $484.43 each month
towards the arrears. 
14.  
The Tenants seek
the opportunity to preserve their tenancy and request a conditional order be
issued requiring them to pay the rent on the first of the month, failing which
the Landlord may apply pursuant to section 78 for an ex parte order
terminating the tenancy. 
15.  
In the alternative, the Tenants
seek an additional two months to make alternative living arrangements. 
16.  
The Tenants live in
the rental unit with their two children and have been Tenants since
September 2016. 
17.  
The Landlord opposes the Tenants’
request for relief for a conditional order and a delay in eviction. The
Landlord is an individual who depends on the Tenants’ income
to pay his mortgage in a timely manner. Due to the Tenants lack of
payments in the past four months, the Landlord has had to take out a second
loan to avoid being in default of mortgage. 
18.  
Further, although not the
subject of this application, the Tenants have outstanding utility bills and the Tenants
have not paid the rent for the past four months (as of the hearing date). 
ANALYSIS
19.  
Based on the evidence before
the Board, I am satisfied that the Tenants have been persistently late in paying their
rent. 
20.  
While there is no doubt that
the Tenants’ have experienced a series of misfortunate events from the job
loss, to their pet’s demise, it is also evident that the Tenants are unable to
afford the rental unit. 
21.  
I say this based on the
income and expense analysis that put the Tenants $515.00 further in debt every month. Further,
neither of the Tenants are working and rely on fixed government benefits
that they receive each month. 
22.  
There is no evidence
suggesting that the Tenants’ financial circumstances will improve in the
foreseeable future, and thus, I find it would be unfair to grant relief and
impose a conditional order as requested by the Tenants. 
23.  
With respect to the request
for relief, given the Tenants’ family size and length of the tenancy, I find a
delay of two months to be reasonable. However, as the hearing was in October
2019 and the order is being issued in March 2020, I find that a further delay
is not warranted. 
24.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
25.  
This order contains all of
the reasons for my decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.   
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The request to review order
TEL-02564-19 issued on September 16, 2019 is granted. 
2.     
The interim order issued on
September 23, 2019 is cancelled. 
3.     
Order TEL-02564-19 is
replaced with the following order.
4.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before March 14, 2020.
5.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 14, 2020, then starting March 15, 2020, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
6.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 15, 2020.
7.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $6,570.99 (less any payments already made to the Landlord)*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to March 3, 2020,
less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
8.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $30.41 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting March 4, 2020 to the date he moves out of the unit.
9.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
10.  
The total amount owing under
this order is $6,745.99 (less any payments already made to the Landlord).

11.  
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing on or before March 14, 2020, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from March
15, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
