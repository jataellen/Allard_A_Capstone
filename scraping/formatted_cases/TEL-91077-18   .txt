Q.R.S.L. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict B.B. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Whitby on June 22, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, I.M.,
and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from February 1, 2018
to June 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective March 21, 2018.
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,323.04 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2018 to March 21, 2018.
4.     
The Tenant paid $400.00
after the application was filed.
5.     
At the hearing the Landlord
provided an update sheet showing that the Tenant currently owes $3735.00 for
arrears of rent up to June 30, 2018 and the filing fee. The Tenant does not
dispute the amount of arrears.
6.     
The Tenant provided detailed
testimony on her personal situation that led to the rent arrears. She is a
single mother of two. Her 15 year old son became extremely sick with kidney
disease in 2017 and underwent a kidney transplant. The Tenant had to stop
working in January 2018 as her son began rejecting the kidney and became very
ill.
7.     
The Tenant’s son was in Sick
Children’s Hospital from February 2018-April 2018 due to the kidney rejection.
During this period of time, the Tenant resided in Ronald McDonald house and
went onto Ontario Works. Supporting medical evidence was provided at the
hearing by the Tenant.
8.     
Her child tax benefits were
temporarily suspended due to the failure to receive and complete certain forms
that were sent to her home address while she was living at the hospital. This
has since been rectified. In addition, her son is on full disability benefits
now as well.
9.     
The Tenant is also eligible
for assistance through the David Foster Society which the hospital is arranging
for her. In addition, she is accessing assistance from the Housing Stability
Program. The Tenant earns minimum wage and will not be able to return to work
full time until her son is stabilized. With the assistance of the various
programs the Tenant provided convincing evidence that she can meet her proposed
repayment plan and her rent going forward with her part time hours. She
proposed a 6 month repayment plan at the hearing.
10.  
It was confirmed at the
hearing that the tenancy dates back to 2015 and the Tenant has no prior history
of arrears.
11.  
The Landlord would not
consent to the Tenant’s proposed repayment plan and does not wish to wait six
months for all the arrears to be fully paid. The Landlord requested a standard
order. 
12.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
13.  
The Tenant’s circumstances
are exceptional and she has otherwise been a responsible Tenant. The Tenant was
careful not to commit to a repayment plan that she could not afford and offered
a reasonable repayment schedule that fit her particular current circumstances.
The panel is confident that she intends to follow through on the repayment and
keep her tenancy.
14.  
The Board finds that the
circumstances of the Tenant outweigh any prejudice caused to the Landlord by
the 6 month repayment plan. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $3735.00 for arrears of rent up to June 30, 2018 and costs.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord the amount set out in paragraph 1 above in accordance with the
following schedule:
(1)  $500.00 on or before July 20, 2018; 
(2)  $500.00 on or before August 20, 2018;
(3)  $500.00 on or before September 20, 2018; 
(4)  $500.00 on or before October 20, 2018;
(5)  $500.00 on or before November 20, 2018; 
(6)  $500.00 on or before December 20, 2018;
(7)  $735.00 on or before January 20, 2018; 
2)   
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord new rent as it comes due on the 1st of the month for
the period of July 1, 2018 to January 30, 2019. 
3)   
If the Tenant fails to make
any one of the payments in accordance with this order, the outstanding balance
of any arrears of rent and costs to be paid by the Tenant to the Landlord
pursuant to paragraph 1 of this order shall become immediately due and owing
and the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to the Board pursuant
to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenant and requiring that the Tenants pay any new arrears, NSF fees and related
charges that became owing after June 30, 2018. The Landlord must make this
application no later than 30 days after the Tenants failure to make a payment.
