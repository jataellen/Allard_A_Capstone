Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 










 

RN or the Landlord applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict and SA and JA or collectively, the 'Tenants because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.  (L1 Application)
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenants because they, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for
each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.  (L2
Application)
 
These applications were heard in Mississauga on
February 8, 2018.   
 
Only the Landlord attended the hearing.  The hearing commenced at 11:30 am and its merits
were heard on an uncontested basis.
 
 
Determinations:
 
L1 Application
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent they were required to pay for the period from November 1, 2017
to February 28, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective January 17, 2018.
2.     
RN testified that the
Tenants are still in possession of the rental unit, and I find this to be the
case.  RN stated that the Tenants claimed to have moved to their mother’s
place, but RN testified that the Tenants’ belongings are still in the rental
unit, the Tenants have not returned their keys to RN, and as of this morning
(February 8, 2018), the upstairs tenants informed RN that the Tenants were in
the rental unit.
3.     
The Landlord confirmed there
is no last month’s rent deposit being held by the Landlord and that the Tenants
have not paid anything to the Landlord after the filing of the L1 application.
4.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
L2 Application
5.     
RN submitted exhibit LL#1,
comprising five pages of photographs taken on February 2, 2018, and which show
the garage still full of the Tenants’ belongings.  This was clearly complained
about in the two N5 notices served by the Landlord on the Tenants.   In order
to remedy the N5 notices, the Tenants must remove their belongings from the
garage. 
6.     
The garage is situated adjacent
to the house that contains the rental unit (hereinafter referred to as the
‘Garage’).  RN affirmed in her testimony that the Tenants have no right to use,
or store their things in, the Garage under the tenancy.
7.     
The Tenants were given a
first N5 Notice of Termination under section 67 of the Act on January 5, 2018.  Serving
a second N5 Notice of Termination on January 13, 2018 was permissible pursuant
to Section 68 of the Act.
8.     
As the Tenants did not remedy
the N5 notices within the voiding period provided for under the Act, I find the
Tenants’ conduct has substantially interfered with the Landlord's and the other
tenants' reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex, and with a lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord.
9.     
While there were other
claims made in the N5 notices, they were not presented by the Landlord during
the hearing.  As a result, my determination is limited to the finding in
paragraph 8 above, with any other claim being denied hereto.
10.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
L1 Application
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before February
27, 2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $3,934.18*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to February 16, 2018.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $39.45 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting February 17, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 27, 2018, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
February 28, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 27, 2018, then starting February 28, 2018, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 28, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before February
27, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $4,670.00** to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after February 28,
2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
L2 Application
10.  
If the Tenants void the L1
application portion of the order above for arrears of rent, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants shall continue but subject to the conditions of
the following order:
11.  
On or before February 28,
2018, the Tenants shall remove from the Garage all of their furniture and all
their personal belongings, along with any and all garbage that they have stored
there.
12.  
For the twelve month period
of March 1, 2018 to February 28, 2019 inclusively, the Tenants shall not engage
in conduct similar to that clearly outlined in the N5 notices served on them on
January 5th and 13th, 2018.  In particular, the Tenants
shall not store or leave any of their personal belongings, furniture, or
any garbage inside the Garage.
13.   If the Tenants fail to comply with any
part of paragraphs 11 or 12 above, the Landlord may apply under section 78 of
the Act, without notice to the Tenants for an order terminating the tenancy and
evicting the Tenant.  The Landlord must make this application no later than 30
days after the Tenants’ breach of paragraph 11 of this order.
