Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-10720-19
 
J
Y (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict M M,
J J, S D and J C because they did not pay the rent that they owe.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on December 9, 2019.
 
The Landlord, and the Tenants, M M and S D, attended the hearing. J
J did not attend.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the
period from October 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October 18, 2019.
Who should be named as Tenants?
2.      In the application, the Landlord named four individuals with the initials
JJ, MM, SD and JC as tenants. All four of these individuals signed the lease; however,
at the time the Landlord filed the application (October 21, 2019), the tenant with
the initials JC had already moved out. Therefore, the application is amended to
remove JC as a party/tenant. This approach is consistent with the leading case of
162994 Ontario Inc. v. Bakker, Crane, Klemos
& Holmes, [2004] O.J. No. 2565 (Ont. C.A.). In that case, the
Court of Appeal held that the Board does not have jurisdiction to order the
payment of arrears of rent against tenants who are not in possession of the
rental unit at the time the application is brought. Therefore, the application
at bar will proceed with MM, JJ and SD as named tenants only. Throughout this order,
MM, JJ and SD are referred to as the “Tenants”. 
 
The Tenants’
preliminary issue
3.      At the beginning of the hearing, the Tenants raised a preliminary issue
– they challenged the validity of the N4 Notice of Termination on which the application
is based. In the N4 Notice, the Landlord claims rent owing for a single rental period,
October 2019. The Tenants claim that pursuant to section 12(4) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”) their rent was suspended during this rental
period and they were not required to pay rent because the Landlord never provided
them a copy of the tenancy agreement. However, the Tenants then acknowledged that
they were given a copy of the only tenancy agreement they signed at the beginning
of the tenancy. The Tenants testified that at some point the parties discussed having
each tenant sign their own separate lease, but this never transpired. Therefore,
I find that there was always only one tenancy agreement and since the Tenants have
had a copy of it throughout the tenancy, the Landlord did not breach section 12
and the Tenants’ rent was not suspended. 
The Tenants owe $7,930.00
4.      The monthly rent as of the date of the hearing is $2,580.00. 
5.     
The Tenants have made no payments
since the application was filed.
6.     
The Tenants did not dispute that they
owe the amount being claimed. Therefore, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities
that the Tenants owe the Landlord $7,930.00, including arrears of rent to December
31, 2019 and the application filing fee.
7.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $2,580.00 from the Tenants and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
8.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from December 1,
2019 to October 18, 2019.
Section 83
considerations 
9.      Only
two of the Tenants attended the hearing: MM and SD. They testified that JC is in
the process of moving out and without him and JC, they cannot afford to pay the
rent on their own. Although the Landlord told the Tenants that he was prepared to
allow them to sublet part of the unit to supplement their rent, the Tenants have
not made efforts to arrange for a sublet. In the meantime, the parties have not
entered into a new lease, so the Tenants’ rent remains $2,580.00. MM and SD also
testified that they cannot pay the arrears and JC did not attend the hearing to
advise whether he is prepared to contribute to the arrears or ongoing rent. 
10.   The
Tenants asked that if the application is granted, they are given one to two months
to move out of the rental unit. In the circumstances, I find it appropriate to extend
the termination date to January 31, 2020. The Tenants are on social assistance and
they require the time to find a new place to live. In addition, the arrears will
not increase over this time because the Landlord is holding a rent deposit, which
can be applied to the rent for January 2020. Accordingly, I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act,
and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until January 31,
2020 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before January 31, 2020.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $3,702.18*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to December 13, 2019, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $84.82 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting December 14, 2019 to the date the Tenants move out of
the unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January
31, 2020, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from February 1, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before January 31, 2020, then starting February
1, 2020, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 1,
2020.
8.      If
the Tenants wish to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenants must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $7,930.00 if the payment is made on or before December 31, 2019, or
ii)       $10,510.00 if the payment is made on or before January 31, 2020**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after February 1, 2020 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
