Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-08760-19










 

R
M (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict R C
J (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on October 15, 2019.
 
Only
the Landlord’s representative, C. N, attended the hearing. The Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from July 1, 2019 to October 31, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 23, 2019.
2.      The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
3.      The monthly rent as of the date of the hearing is $993.83.
4.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $993.83 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2019
to July 23, 2019.
6.      The
Tenant paid $3,171.49 after the application was filed.
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before October 28, 2019.
2.      As
of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation
the Landlord is entitled to by $614.20*.
3.      However,
the Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the
Landlord owes the Tenant: $32.67 per day for compensation for the use of the
unit starting October 18, 2019 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit,
and $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
4.      The
Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as
a result of this order.
5.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before October 28, 2019, then starting October
29, 2019, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
6.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after October 29,
2019.
7.      If,
on or before October 28, 2019, the Tenant pays the amount of $993.83** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenant could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
8.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after October 29, 2019 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
