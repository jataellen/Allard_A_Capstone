Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-92649-18
 










 
 

M.C
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict M.C
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes
(“the L1 application”).
 
The
Landlord also applied to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the
Tenant has been persistently late in paying her rent (“the L2 application”).
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on March 22, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord’s representative, I.M (“IM”) attended the
hearing.
 
The Tenant did not attend the hearing.  As more particularly
described below, the Tenant faxed a letter to the Board on March 22, 2018 dated
March 21, 2018 indicating that she would not be attending the hearing because
she had a business appointment.  Nonetheless, I waited until after 10 a.m. on
the hearing date.  When the Tenant still did not arrive, I proceeded to hear
the Landlord’s application.
 
Preliminary
Issue:
 
1.   
At
1:24 a.m. on March 22, 2018, the Board received a fax letter from the Tenant dated
March 21, 2018, indicating that she would not be attending the hearing because
“…It has become necessary for me to attend a business appointment.  As a
commission sales representative, I do not feel that I can cancel this client
meeting” (“the Tenant’s letter”)
 
2.    In the
Tenant’s letter, among other things, the Tenant made written submissions in
connection with the Landlord’s applications, including:
 
•       
The fact that she has been a longstanding tenant of the unit of
over 15 years;
•       
She is a person who honours her responsibilities;
•       
She has worked very hard to rebuild her life after caring for her
recently deceased mother for a period of 5 ½ years;
•       
She has struggled with her own health challenges and is presently
taking medication to manage “a chronic illness”’;
•       
The challenges she faces as a real estate broker due to the
cooling of the market contributed to by 2017 government rules;
•       
The Tenant’s confidence that her business and income will pick up
in the Spring of 2018;
•       
Her request to be allowed until April 30, 2018 to pay her arrears
of rent on the L1 application and to continue her tenancy;
•       
Her current situation that she is “…doing nothing but working –
all day, every day”.
 
3.   
Because the Tenant submitted the Tenant letter for my
consideration at the hearing and for me to use in making my decision, the rules
of procedure fairness, in my view, required disclosure of the Tenant’s letter
to IM at the hearing to allow IM to make oral submissions in response to the
written points made in the Tenant’s letter.
 
4.    At
the hearing, IM was permitted to make oral submissions in response to the
Tenant’s letter, which were accompanied by the filing with the Board of a
number of previous decisions involving the parties, including the Board’s
decisions in TSL-51230-14; TSL-65694-15; TSL-71012-16 RV AM; TSL-86931-17.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from December 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective January 18, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenant has been persistently late in paying her rent.  The uncontested
documentation before me at the hearing shows that for the 12 month period
between February 2017 and January 2018, she has only paid her rent on time on
one occasion.
 
3.      The
Landlord submitted at the hearing a written summary showing that the arrears
owed by the Tenant to the hearing date are $5,878.25.   The filing fee of
$190.00 brings the Landlord’s total claim to $6,068.25.  With respect to the L1
application, IM requested a standard order of termination.
 
4.      For
the Landlord, IM pointed out that the Tenant had made a decision not to attend
the hearing but instead had elected not to cancel a client meeting.  She
adumbrated that the Landlord and Tenant have a long history, submitting several
decisions of the Board (as specified above) in the past involving the Tenant.
 
5.      IM
noted that many of the matters raised in the Tenant’s letter had been
previously raised and considered by the Board in the previous decisions filed,
including her mother’s longstanding illness and her caregiving role.  She added
that the Tenant’s employment in the real estate industry has not changed and
this fact, and the prospect of an improved real estate market, was no
justification for denying the Landlord the relief requested.
 
6.      IM
urged me to consider the circumstances of the Landlord, including the fact that
the issues raised by the Tenant are longstanding and do not seem to have abated
or been ameliorated over the last 4-5 years.
 
7.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,525.60 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
8.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2018
to January 18, 2018.
 
9.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
10.   The
Tenant did not attend the hearing; making a choice not to cancel a client
meeting and to submit the client letter.  I have carefully considered the
Tenant’s letter and its contents; as well as the longstanding duration of this
tenancy.  While the Tenant’s letter raises many ostensibly compelling
circumstances, it is apparent from the previous decisions filed with me that
many of these issues have been raised by the Tenant and considered by the Board
before.  While the issue of the Tenant’s own health appears to be raised here
for the first time, the particulars given in the Tenant’s letter are scarce and
I did not have the benefit of the Tenant’s oral evidence to highlight its
nature, extent and impact.
 
11.   In
their totality, the facts before me persuade me that it would be unfair to
grant relief from eviction, including the information contained in the Tenant’s
letter.  It is plain that this is a longstanding tenancy which the Tenant
remains hopeful that she can preserve.  However, at the hearing of these
applications, the Tenant deliberately did not attend and therefore, I was not
provided the benefit of her in-person position on the issues in these
applications or the impact on her of the termination of the tenancy.
It is ordered that:
 
L1 application
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the L1 portion of this order as set out below (and subject to
the L2 portion of this order which follows), the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before April 15, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4,434.44*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to April 4, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $50.19 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting April 5, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before April
15, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from April 16, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 15, 2018, then starting April 16,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 16, 2018.
 
8.      If,
on or before April 15, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $7,539.90** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, the L1 portion of this order for eviction
will be void (subject to the L2 portion of this order which follows below). 
This means that the tenancy would not be terminated (under the L1 portion of
this order) and the Tenant could remain in the unit (subject to the L2 portion
of this order below).  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside the L1 portion of this order (subject to the L2 portion of this order
below) if she pays the amount required under that subsection on or after April
16, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
L2 application
 
10.    If
the Tenant pays the amount set out in paragraph 8 above to void the L1 portion
of this order, the tenancy shall continue until April 15, 2018 on which date
the tenancy is terminated due to persistent late payment of rent.
 
11.   If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 15, 2018, then starting April 16,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
12.   Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after April 16, 2018.
