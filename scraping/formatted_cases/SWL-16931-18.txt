Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: SWL-16931-18
 
CC
and CDL (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict NM (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.  (L1)
 
The Landlords also applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant has been
persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent. The Landlords also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination
date. (L2)
 
These applications were heard in [CITY] on
July 18, 2018.
 
Determinations:
Application to Evict
a Tenant for Non-payment of Rent and to Collect the Rent the Tenant Owes (L1)
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from April 1, 2018 to
July 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of
Termination effective April 28, 2018.
 
2.      The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
 
3.      The monthly rent is $1,065.75.
 
4.     
The Landlords collected a
rent deposit of $1,050.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlords.
 
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2015 to April 28, 2018.
 
6.     
The Tenant paid $1,935.75 after
the application was filed.
7.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
Application to Terminate a Tenancy and Evict a Tenant (L2)
1.     
The Tenant has persistently
failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
2.     
The term of the tenancy is
month-to-month and rent is due on the first of the month.  The Tenant has paid
the rent late every month in the last 12 months.
 
3.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.  The Landlord advised
that if the Tenant pays the arears to void the Application to Evict a Tenant
for Non-payment of Rent and to Collect the Rent the Tenant Owes (L1), she would
be satisfied with a conditional order allowing the tenancy to continue on
condition that the Tenant pays the rent on time for the next 12 months.
It is ordered that:
Application to Evict
a Tenant for Non-payment of Rent and to Collect the Rent the Tenant Owes (L1)
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before July 31,
2018.
 
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlords $343.92*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to July 20, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on
the rent deposit.
 
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $35.04 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
July 21, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before July 31, 
2018,
the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated
from August 1, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before July 31, 2018, then starting August 1, 2018, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlords, on or after August 1, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before July 31,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $2,017.25** to the Landlords or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after August 1, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlords.
 
Application to Terminate a Tenancy and Evict a Tenant (L2)
10.   If the Tenant voids the above Application to Evict a Tenant for
Non-payment of Rent and to Collect the Rent the Tenant Owes (L1) termination
provisions by paying the amount owed, then the Landlord’s application for
eviction of the Tenant based on persistent late payment  is denied on the
condition that:
 
a)    The Tenant shall pay the full monthly rent on or before the first
day of each month, commencing August 1, 2018 and for 12 months thereafter up to
and including July 1, 2019.
11.   If the Tenant fails to comply with the conditions set out in
paragraph 10, above, then, within 30 days of the breach, the Landlord may apply
under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for
an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant.  The Landlord must
make the application within 30 days of a breach of a condition set out in
paragraph 10 of this order.
