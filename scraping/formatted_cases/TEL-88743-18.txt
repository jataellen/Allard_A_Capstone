Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-88743-18
 










 
 

Y.Z.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict J.K.(the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes and has
been persistently late paying the rent. Pursuant to s. 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') the Tenant applied for an order
determining that the Landlord failed to meet the Landlord’s maintenance
obligations under the Act or failed to comply with health, safety, housing or
maintenance standards.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on April 30, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s son, P.Z., the Landlord’s daughter, Y.Z. (a.k.a. ‘E’)
Z., the Tenant, and the Tenant’s representative, R.C., attended the hearing.
The Tenant also called as a witness: T.A. (the ‘Tenant’s Roommate’). 
 
Determinations:
THE APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT
OF RENT
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from January 15, 2018 to May 14, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective February 19, 2018.
2.      In
response to my questions the Tenant was unable to produce any testimony or
other evidence to support her assertion that the amount being claimed by the
Landlord was not correct. 
3.      As
a result, I find that the arrears of rent owing for the period ending May 14,
2018 total $7,700.00 as claimed by the Landlord. 
4.      The
Landlord incurred costs of $190.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
THE APPLICATION FOR PERSISTENT
LATE PAYMENT OF THE RENT
5.      The
Landlord’s notice of termination for persistent late payment of rent says that
rent is due on the 15th day of each month. It also says that for the
period January 15, 2017 to February 14, 2018 the Tenant paid rent late 9 times
out of 13 months. 
6.      The
Landlord has failed to keep appropriate records of payments made and could not
produce a ledger at the hearing. However, it did produce and file into evidence
photographs of rent receipts issued which support the assertion that during the
period in question the Tenant paid rent late 7 times out of 13 months. 
7.      The
Tenant says that when she entered into the lease agreement she told the
Landlord that her income arrives monthly near the end of the month. So he knew
or ought to have known she could not pay on the 15th of the month. She
also says at one point she paid half of the monthly rent in order to switch the
due date to the first of each month. 
8.      The
difficulty with this is that the lease and the receipts all make it clear rent
was due on the 15th and the Tenant does not deny that. The Tenant
also does not deny that the Landlord never agreed to switch the due date for
the rent to the 1st. Further, if the Tenant’s income arrives at the
end of the month there is nothing to stop her from holding onto it until the
following 15th of the month and paying rent on time. 
9.      Given
all of the above and the fact that the Tenant produced no evidence to refute
the Landlord’s evidence regarding dates of payment I am satisfied that the
Tenant has been persistently late paying the rent. 
THE TENANT’S SECTION 82 CLAIMS
10.   At
the beginning of the hearing the Tenant stated she filed an application with
the Board the same date as the hearing before the Board. The parties agreed
that the Tenant’s application would be cancelled and instead her issues would
proceed by way of section 82 of the Act.
11.   The
Tenant’s complaints are: lack of heat; and leaking from the skylight and chimney.
Lack of Heat
12.   The
Tenant moved into the rental unit on or about December 15, 2016. She says that
first winter the heat was fine but in November or December of 2017 the Tenant
noticed a lack of heat. The Tenant’s Roommate says his room in the basement is
fairly comfortable but he can sometimes see his breath. 
13.   The
Tenant says lack of heat is particularly problematic because the Tenant has MS
and needs a steady supply of heat. She says she uses three space heaters to
supplement the heat. She had two prior to moving in and one was loaned to her
in January of 2018. The Tenant says her hydro costs jumped as a result of using
the space heaters but failed to produce the range of bills that would
corroborate that assertion. 
14.   The
Tenant says she complained to the Landlord’s Son and Daughter about lack of
heat but nothing was done until January 24, 2018 when the ducts were cleaned. The
Landlord’s Daughter says the Tenant suggested the ducts needed cleaning
sometime in January, 2018 so that is why duct cleaning was done. According to
the Tenant vents were closed and/or redirected but that did not resolve the
problem. 
15.   Then
on or about February 6, 2018 the Landlord sent someone to examine the furnace. A
picture of the thermostat taken that day shows the thermostat was set at 75 but
the interior temperature was 78 degrees. 
16.   Text
messages back and forth between the parties indicate the Landlord sent technicians
to look at the furnace more than once. The Landlord’s Daughter informed the
Tenant that the technicians could find no problem with the furnace. 
17.   The
Tenant says a friend of the Tenant’s Roommate who is a furnace technician looked
at the problem and told them the heat was being diverted to the roof. That
person however, was not called to testify. 
18.   On
March 18, 2018 the Landlord’s Daughter did an inspection and measured the
temperature. She says it was 22 degrees Celsius in the basement and in one of
the bedrooms it was 23 Celsius. 
19.   The
difficulty with the Tenant’s claim with respect to lack of heat is that she
bears the burden of proof. That means she has the onus of leading sufficient
evidence to establish there is actually a problem with the heating system in
the rental unit. 
20.   The
only real evidence in support of the Tenant’s claims is the statements by her
and the Tenant’s Roommate that it was cold. The Tenant’s photographs showing
moisture on the windows do not in fact support the conclusion the temperature
in the rental unit was below an acceptable level. Rather they show the windows
are not weather tight. 
21.   In
contrast, the Landlord’s Daughter actually took temperature readings. Those
readings show the unit was heated to an acceptable level. 
22.   Given
all of the above, I do not know if there is a problem with the heating system
in the rental unit or not. As the Tenant bears the burden of proving that there
is a problem, this part of her claim must be dismissed. 
Leaking Skylight and
Chimney
23.   The
Tenant says when it rains she wakes up to find water on her kitchen counter.
She is not certain when the problem started but it appears to have been in
early 2018. The Tenant’s Roommate says there is leaking in the basement as
well. The Tenant and her Roommate believe water is leaking between the walls. There
have been puddles in the basement although that appears to have been a recent
problem. 
24.   The
Tenant complained to the Landlord and he and his son attended the unit and
inspected. They returned about a week later and did some work and told the
Tenant the leak in the skylight and the chimney were repaired. That was
February 24, 2018. 
25.   The
Tenant says this was not sufficient to resolve the problem. It was not fixed.
In addition, the interior damage caused by water leaking was never repaired. The
Landlord’s Daughter acknowledges the interior damage was never repaired. 
26.   Shortly
after this an ice storm occurred and the Tenant woke to find water on the floor
and kitchen counter and from the ceiling. She says she did not contact the
Landlord after that about it because she knows they would do nothing about it
and she is sick of it. 
27.   The
Landlord’s Daughter says that during the inspection of March 18, 2018 the Tenant
told her the problem was resolved. 
28.   So
given all of the evidence before the Board I accept that there is leaking from
somewhere into the rental unit, some work was done on it in a timely manner but
that work was ineffective – it did not resolve the problem. And the work that
was done was never completed. The interior damage was never repaired. 
29.   As
a result I find that the Landlord is in breach of s. 20(1) of the Act.
30.   An
order shall issue requiring the Landlord to determine the source of the leaking
and repair both the leak and the interior water damage. 
31.   The
Tenant also seeks abatement of the rent. The Tenant is entitled to some
abatement because the Landlord knew about the interior damage and simply chose
to do nothing about it. However, the Landlord did not know that the repairs
performed on February 24, 2018 were ineffective, so the Tenant is not entitled
to abatement with respect to the continued leaking. Given the relatively minor
nature of the interior water damage, only a relatively minor abatement is
warranted which I fix at $100.00. 
RELIEF
FROM EVICTION
32.   Pursuant
to s. 83(2) of the Act the Board is required to consider all of the
circumstances to determine whether or not relief from eviction should be
granted. The Tenant says she wants to move out but needs some delay while her
daughters are in school. She has three daughters ages 9, 11 and 16. She asks
that she not have to move before June 1, 2018. 
33.   The
Tenant says she has been diagnosed with MS. She has weekly injections that
cause flu-like symptoms. She suffers from forgetfulness and fatigue as a result
of her MS. 
34.   No
medical documentation was offered to support the Tenant’s testimony about her
illness. 
35.   The
difficulty with the Tenant’s request for relief is that the Tenant cannot
afford to pay the Landlord the rent let alone anything towards the rent
arrears. In fact it is something of a mystery as to why the Tenant ever thought
she could afford this rental unit. So any delay in eviction would be highly
prejudicial to the Landlord. I would also observe that the inevitable and
unavoidable delay in issuing this order means the Tenant has gained the delay
she seeks simply through the passage of time. 
36.   The
Landlord’s relatively minor breach is not sufficient to justify mandatory
relief from eviction under s. 83(3) of the Act. 
37.   Given
the above I am not satisfied in all of the circumstances that it would not be
unfair to grant relief from eviction. The Board’s standard order shall issue. 
CONCLUSION
38.   The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $2,200.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
shall be applied to the rent due for the last month of the tenancy pursuant to
s. 106(10) of the Act. 
39.   Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from December 5, 2016
to February 19, 2018 totalling $41.46. This amount shall also be offset against
the rent arrears owing. 
40.   This
order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further
reasons shall be issued.
It
is ordered that:
1.      On
or before June 30, 2018, the Landlord shall hire a contractor to examine the
roof, the chimney and the skylight to determine if they are in good working
order and to effect repair. 
2.      The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before June 16, 2018.
3.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $6,949.77*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to June 5, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit and less the amount of the
abatement the Landlord owes the Tenant.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $72.33 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting June 6, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
5.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
6.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 16,
2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from June 17, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
7.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before June 16, 2018, then starting June 17,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 17, 2018.
