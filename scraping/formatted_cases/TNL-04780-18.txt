Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
 



 


 


 



 
 
 
RPMS (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict JA and FA (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on May 31, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, FQ,
and the Tenant, FA, attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
$1,935.60 of the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period
from April 1, 2018 to May 31, 2018. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination.
 
2.     
The Tenants also owe the
Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     
The total amount owing is
$2,125.60 ($1,935.60 + $100.00).
 
4.     
The Tenant is seeking a
payment plan, and suggested a payment of $500.00 in addition to the full
monthly rent going forward.  He said that he has not made any payments towards
the rent since April, 2018, because he was laid off in April, 2018.  He only
received the proper paperwork to apply for EI the previous week, and only just
discovered that he could apply to the rent bank for help.  He has done
carpentry work for over 20 years, and has had no problems maintaining
employment and the rent for the last two years that he has lived in the rental
unit.  He admitted that he has sometimes had problems in the past, with other
Landlords, paying rent.  The Tenant believes that he will receive EI very soon,
or a call back to work.  He said that his son can help him out a little bit
towards paying the rent.  If he had to move out of the unit, he needs until the
end of July to find alternative accommodation.
 
5.     
The Landlord is seeking a
standard termination order.  There is concern that the Tenant is unable to
afford the rental unit, has delayed in applying for EI, and also delayed in
applying to the rent bank.  The Landlord’s representative said it was not
reasonable for the Landlord to wait until the end of July for eviction, at
which time there would have been no rent payment for four months.
 
6.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), in particular, that the Tenant proposes paying
the full rent going forward, as well as reasonable payments towards the arrears
and costs.  He has been able to pay the full rent on time for the last two
years of this tenancy, and he demonstrated a sincere desire to maintain this
tenancy because of the convenience of the rental unit for his daily activities
and proximity to work, when he gets called back to work.  I find that it would
not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the conditions set out
in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.     
The Tenants shall pay the
Landlord $2,125.60 arrears and costs as
follows:                                                      
 
a)   
$500.00 on or before June
30, 2018
b)   
$500.00 on or before July
31, 2018
c)   
$500.00 on or before August
31, 2018
d)   
$500.00 on or before
September 30, 2018, and
e)   
$125.60 on or before October
31, 2018.
 
2.     
The Tenants shall also pay
the Landlord rent owing for the months of:
 
a)   
June, 2018, no later than
June 15, 2018
b)   
July, 2018, no later than
before July 1, 2018
c)   
August, 2018, no later than
August 1, 2018
d)   
September, 2018, no later
than September 1, 2018, and
e)   
October, 2018, no later than
October 1, 2018.
 
3.     
If the Tenants fail to make
any one of the payments in accordance with this order, the outstanding balance
of any arrears of rent and costs to be paid by the Tenants to the Landlord
pursuant to paragraph 1 of this order shall become immediately due and owing
and the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenants apply to the Board pursuant
to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenants and requiring that the Tenants pay any new arrears, NSF fees and
related charges that became owing after May 31, 2018. The Landlord must make
this application no later than 30 days after the Tenant’s failure to make a
payment.
