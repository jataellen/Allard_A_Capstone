Order under Sections 68
and 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-90399-18
 











 
 
 

J.M. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict B.M. and H.J. (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe (the ‘L1 application’).
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenants because they, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another tenant; and because they, another occupant of the
rental unit or a person the Tenants permitted in the residential complex have
seriously impaired the safety of any person. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date (the ‘L2 application’).
 
This application was heard in Toronto on June 4, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenants
attended the hearing. 
 
Preliminary Issue:
 

At the outset of the hearing, both Tenants were present and
     requested an adjournment of this matter to have it heard along with their
     tenant applications which were recently filed. 
I advised the Tenants that they could bring up any of their
     issues at the hearing pursuant to section 82 of the Residential
     Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). However, the Tenants did not have
     their evidence ready and were not prepared to proceed with their issues at
     the hearing. 
As the Tenants had already filed their own applications and as
     those applications are not factually related to the Landlord’s
     applications, I denied the Tenants’ request for an adjournment.   The
     Tenants are free to raise their issues when their applications are
     scheduled to be heard. 
The second-named Tenant left the hearing at some point after
     hearing the Landlord’s direct testimony. For the remainder of the hearing,
     the Board only heard testimony from the Landlord and the first-named
     Tenant. 

Determinations:
The L1 Application 
5.    The Tenants have not paid the total rent they
were required to pay for the period from March 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018. 
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
April 16, 2018.
6.    The outstanding arrears owing for the period ending
June 30, 2018, total $3,000.00. 
7.    The Landlord paid $190.00 for the costs of
filing the application and the Landlord is entitled to be reimbursed for those
costs. 
8.    The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $850.00
from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
9.    Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenants for the period from June 8, 2017 to April 16, 2018, in the amount of $13.11.
The L2 Application
10. The
Landlord says the Tenants removed the smoke detectors from the rental unit. The
Landlord says that he entered the rental unit on April 12, 2018, and discovered
that the smoke detector was missing. The Landlord says he spoke to the
first-named Tenant ’BM’ but he did not know where the detector was. The
Landlord says he lectured BM at that time on the value of smoke detectors and
told him to reinstall the smoke detector as soon as possible. 
11. During
that same visit, the Landlord noticed that the carbon monoxide detector was not
plugged in but was lying next to the fridge. The Landlord says when he asked BM
about the carbon monoxide detector, BM picked it up and plugged it into the
wall. 
12. The
Landlord says that he entered the rental unit again on April1 5, 2018, and he
noticed the smoke detector was still missing. The Landlord spoke to BM again
about this issue and served the second N5 notice of termination. The Landlord
served the first N5 earlier in April regarding the same issue.  
13. The
Landlord says that he personally replaced the smoke detector on April 17, 2018,
and he has not visited the rental unit since that date. 
14. BM says
that the unit did not have a smoke detector when he and the other Tenant moved
into the unit. BM admits that the first-named Tenant, ‘HJ’ is a smoker, but he
says she does not smoke in the rental unit. Although BM confirmed that he did
not personally remove the smoke detector or the carbon monoxide detector, he
could not confirm whether HJ had removed the two detectors. As mentioned
earlier, HJ left the hearing room before she could provide any testimony. 
15. The
Landlord says he has a long history of owning rooming houses in the city and
east of the city and he makes a yearly practice of inspecting each unit to
ensure that smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors are present in each
unit. The Landlord says he even goes so far as to clip newspaper articles
whenever a death is reportedly due to a missing smoke detector. The Landlord
says he takes this matter very seriously and is very diligent about ensuring
that all of his rental units are equipped with working smoke detectors. All of
the detectors in the complex are wired so that a fire in one unit will trigger
the alarm in all of the units. The Landlord says he does this to ensure the
safety of everyone in the complex. 
16. Based on the evidence before me, I am satisfied on the
balance of probabilities that the Tenants removed the smoke detector and the
carbon monoxide detector from the rental unit. The Landlord provided testimony
in a detailed and consistent manner and I have no reason to disbelieve him. BM
provided testimony but he was unable to provide any details about HJ’s actions
and HJ was not present to answer questions. For these reasons, I find that this
conduct substantially interferes with a lawful right, privilege or interest of
the Landlord. This conduct also seriously impaired the safety of other persons living
in the residential complex. 
Relief From Eviction
17. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act'). The circumstances here are that, based on their monthly income and
expenses, the Tenants cannot afford the rental unit. The Tenants have been
living in the unit since July 2017 and they have already secured another place
to live. The Tenants are seeking relief from eviction in the form of delay
until July 5, 2018, when their new living accommodations will be available. 
18. The Landlord says that he is experiencing financial
hardship because the Tenants have not been paying their rent. The arrears are
now substantial and they continue to grow. 
19. Based on all of the circumstances, I find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
The Tenants cannot afford the rental unit, the arrears are now quite
substantial and this is a relatively short-term tenancy. The Tenants also committed
an act which interferes with the Landlord’s rights and compromises the safety
of the other residents in the building. For these reasons, I find that it would
be unfair to grant relief from eviction. 
 
 
It is ordered that:
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the
rental unit on or before June 24, 2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $1,655.11*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to June 13, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $27.95 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting June 14, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 24, 2018, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June
25, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 24, 2018, then starting June 25, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 25, 2018.
