Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-05797-18











 
 

HR (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict AJ (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay
the rent and compensation the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a
condition specified in the settlement mediated by the
Board on March 13, 2018 with respect to application TNL-01891-18 ,
TNL-02360-18.
 
This application was heard in
Toronto on July 24, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, MW,
and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations and Reasons:
 
 
1.     
The mediated settlement
provided that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s)
specified in the settlement.
 
2.     
I find that the Tenant has
not met the following condition specified in the settlement:
 
(a) 
The Tenant has breached
paragraph 6 of the settlement by failing to pay the rent for June, 2018, on or
before the first business day in June, 2018.
 
3.     
The previous application
included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The
resulting mediated settlement required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of
the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     
The amount that is still
owing up to July 31, 2018, according to the terms of the mediated settlement,
for arrears of rent and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application is $3,723.52.  The Tenant also owes the Landlord $42.65
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting August 1, 2018 to the
date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     
Since the date of the
mediated settlement, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from May 1, 2018 to July 31, 2018.
 
6.     
The Landlord stated the
Tenant has breached the mediated settlement of March 13, 2018, and is therefore
seeking eviction pursuant to section 78 of the Act.
 
7.     
The Tenant admitted he
breached the mediated settlement.  He said that the original arrears were
caused by his roommate, to whom he had paid the rent, and who was then
responsible for paying the Landlord.  The Tenant explained that he is
self-employed, and that recent months have been very slow for him.  He pointed
to the fact that he has made large payments towards the arrears in April, May
and June, 2018.  The Tenant has lived in the unit six years on his own.  He
said that he is planning to vacate the unit, and that he wishes to leave, but
he needs until the end of August, 2018, to find alternative accommodation.
 
8.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.  The Tenant has
made some payments towards the arrears, but has not paid anything at all
towards the July rent.  The arrears and costs, plus the August rent, would be
approaching $5,000.00.  The Tenant is not only responsible for large arrears,
but he has been persistently late in paying the rent as well, and that was also
why the Landlord sought to evict him.  The Landlord has been severely
prejudiced by having this large a balance owing for so many months.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before August 19, 2018.
 
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $2,744.18*. This amount represents the rent owing up to August 8, 2018
and the costs related to the application fee for the previous application.
 
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $42.65 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
August 9, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before August 19, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from August
20, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before August 19, 2018, then starting August 20, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after August 20, 2018.
