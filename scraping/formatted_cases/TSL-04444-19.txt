Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-04444-19
 






 


 



 
 
FY (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict AS and MP (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay
the rent that the Tenants owe. 
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenants because the Tenants entered into an agreement
to terminate the tenancy.
 
This combined L1/L3 Application was heard in Toronto
on May 29, 2019.
 
The Landlord and the Tenants attended the hearing. The
parties testified on their own behalves. AAG also testified for the Landlord. 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
For the reasons set out
below, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Tenants owe the
Landlord $8,590.00. If the Tenants do not pay this amount by June 16, 2019, the
tenancy will terminate.
Preliminary issue: service of the N4 Notice of Termination 
2.     
The Landlord relies on an N4
Notice with a termination date of March 12, 2019 as the basis for her L1
Application. In the certificate of service and in her testimony, the Landlord
claims that she served the N4 Notice on the Tenant on February 26, 2019.
3.     
The male Tenant, AS, testified
that he never received an N4 Notice with a termination date of March 12, 2019.
AS testified that the only N4 Notices he received from the Landlord are two
copies of the same N4 Notice, bearing a termination date of March 6, 2019. AS
testified that one copy of this N4 Notice was left with the concierge for the
building on February 26, 2019. AS submitted a copy of a document that he claims
to be the concierge’s records for his unit. The document indicates that an
envelope was left for “the resident” on February 26, 2019 at 9:55 p.m. and it
was picked up on April 29, 2019 at 9:58 p.m. AS testified that he was never
served with any other N4 Notices on February 26, 2019. 
4.     
The female Tenant, MP,
testified that she also did not receive the N4 Notice at issue (termination
date March 12, 2019). However, MP also testified that she moved out of the
rental unit on February 6, 2019. I did not hear any evidence that MP notified
the Landlord that she had moved out. Therefore, I find that the issue of valid
service does not turn on MP’s evidence that she did not receive the N4 Notice
if I am otherwise satisfied that the Landlord served this notice on both
Tenants in accordance with the Act, based on her reasonable belief that MP was
still living in the rental unit at the time.  
5.     
In her testimony, the
Landlord acknowledged that she served the Tenants two other N4 Notices but she
did so on a different day prior to February 26, 2019. The Landlord testified
that the only N4 Notice she served on the Tenants on February 26, 2019 is the
notice that forms the basis of this application with a termination date March
12, 2019.The Landlord testified that she served this N4 Notice on the Tenants
in three different ways:  by placing a copy under the door of the rental unit,
leaving a copy with the concierge for the building and sending a copy by email
to AS. The Landlord testified that she left the copies at the rental
unit/residential complex at approximately 9:30 – 10:00 p.m. and she sent the
email to AS later that night. 
6.     
The Landlord presented a
video at the hearing, taken by her husband’s cell phone, in which the Landlord
is seen and heard saying the date: February 26, 2019. The Landlord knocks on
the door of the rental unit a few times but there is no answer. The Landlord
then says that she is placing an N4 Notice under the Tenants’ door. The
Landlord can be seen putting an N4 Notice into an envelope and then crouching
down toward the floor. The termination date of the N4 Notice cannot clearly be
seen and the Landlord is not clearly seen slipping the envelope under the door.
The Landlord’s husband, AAG, testified that he filmed this video on his phone
and he witnessed the Landlord placing the envelope under the Tenants’ door. AAG
also testified that the envelope contained the N4 Notice that is in the Board’s
file. I note that the information on AAG’s phone indicates that the video was
taken at 9:56 p.m. on February 26, 2019.
7.     
The Landlord also presented
the email that she sent the Tenant at 11:32 p.m. on February 26, 2019 on her
cell phone. The email has the N4 Notice with the March 12th
termination date attached.
8.     
When I consider all of the
evidence before me, I find that it is more likely than not that the Landlord
served the Tenants with the N4 Notice at issue on February 26, 2019. The
Landlord’s testimony about how and when she served the document is consistent
with AAG’s testimony and with various other pieces of evidence – the video on
AAG’s phone, the concierge’s records and the Landlord’s email to AS. The
Landlord’s testimony is also consistent with the information in the certificate
of service, which indicates that the Landlord served the N4 Notice on February
26, 2019 but placing the document under the Tenants’ door. 
9.     
Although it is always a
challenging task to prove a negative, like the Tenants’ claim that they did not
receive the N4 Notice, the Landlord ultimately has the burden of proving that
she served the N4 Notice in accordance with the Act. In the circumstances, I am
satisfied that the Landlord did in fact serve the N4 Notice on the Tenants and
the method and timing of service complies with the Act. The hearing proceeded
based on this determination. 
The Tenants owe the Landlord $8,590.00
10.  
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from February
20, 2019 to June 19, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a
Notice of Termination effective March 12, 2019.
11.  
The tenancy started on
January 20, 2018. The rent is due on the 20th day of each month. The
rent is $2,100.00 per month. 
12.  
The Landlord claims that the
Tenants have not paid any rent since February 20, 2019 and the total amount
owing is $8,590.00, including $8,400.00 for arrears up to June 19, 2019 and
$190.00 for the application filing fee. In support of her application, the
Landlord submitted a rent receipt dated January 15, 2018 for $4,200.00 and all
of the cheques the Tenants have provided her throughout the rest of the
tenancy.
13.  
The Tenants did not dispute
that they have not paid the Landlord any money since February 20, 2019. The Tenants
only took issue with their initial payment of $4,200.00 from January, 2018. The
Tenants testified that they have never been clear about whether this payment
was for rent. They do not dispute that they made this payment to the Landlord
in January, 2018, although they claim they have never been given a receipt for
this payment.
14.  
I find the Tenants’ position
and their questions regarding the purpose of the $4,200.00 payment from
January, 2018 very bizarre. The Tenants did not dispute that the tenancy
started in January, 2018; that the rent has always been $2,100.00 per month;
that they did not expect to live in the rental unit for free in January and
February, 2018; and that any other rent payments they made were for March 20,
2018 and onwards. I accept the Landlord’s testimony that the parties agreed and
always understood that this payment was in respect of the rent for January and
February, 2018. The Tenants seems to question whether this payment should be
applied to the arrears owing under the application (i.e. for the period
beginning February 20, 2019) but I have no basis for making such a finding.
15.  
The Tenants did not present
any concrete evidence to cast doubt on the Landlord’s claim or the substantial
evidence she presented in support of that claim. Therefore, based on the
evidence before me, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Tenants
owe the Landlord $8,590.00 as the Landlord claims. 
 
 
Section 83 considerations 
16.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act. In arriving at this determination, I considered
the following circumstances disclosed at the hearing: 
•        
The fact that the Tenants
owe the Landlord significant arrears and they have not paid the Landlord any
money for five months.
•        
AS’s testimony that he
cannot afford the rent. AS testified that his only current source of income is
OSAP as he is in school studying to become a paralegal. AS testified that he
receives $1,500.00 per month from OSAP but this is less than his monthly rent
of $2,100.00. Not only are his OSAP payments insufficient to cover his rent,
they also do not allow AS to make any payments toward the arrears. AS testified
that his sister sometimes sends him money but he did not have anything in
writing from her to confirm that she is willing and able to assist him with his
rent or the arrears.
•        
MP’s testimony that although
she makes $2,500.00/month as a post-office manager, she no longer lives in the
rental unit and she no longer contributes to the rent. 
•        
AS’s testimony that he wants
to move out of the rental unit at the end of June, 2019 or by July 15, 2019 at
the latest.
•        
The fact that the parties
signed a valid agreement to end the tenancy with a termination date of February
20, 2019. 
17.  
I find that it would not be
appropriate to either order conditional relief from eviction because AS
testified that he wants to move out of the rental unit in any event. I also
find that it would not be appropriate to delay eviction to June 30, 2019 or
beyond because the Tenants testified that they cannot pay all of the arrears
owing by June 30th.I find it unlikely that the Tenants will pay the
rent that will become due on June 20th given AS’ testimony about his
financial estuation and MP’s testimony that she is only prepared to contribute
$400.00/month toward the arrears. In short, I find that if the tenancy is
permitted to continue, event until June 30, 2019 it is more likely than not
that the arrears will continue to increase. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before June 16,
2019.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $7,318.26*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to June 5, 2019.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $69.04 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting June 6, 2019 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 16, 2019, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June
17, 2019 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 16, 2019, then starting June 17, 2019, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 17, 2019.
8.     
If, on or before June 16,
2019, the Tenants pay the amount of $8,590.00** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after June 17, 2019
but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
