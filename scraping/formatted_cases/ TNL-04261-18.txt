Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-04261-18










 
 

NS
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict and NT
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Newmarket on July 25, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s agent, YH (the Landlord’s husband), the Tenant’s
husband MPE, and the Tenant’s representative, CP, attended the hearing.
 
 Determinations:
 
1.      The
rental unit is a house. The tenancy began on July 28, 2016.
 
2.      Prior
to July 28, 2016 the house was owned by the Tenant and her husband MPE. The
house was sold to the Landlord (or the Landlord and her husband, YH. The Tenant
and her husband and other family members continued to reside in the house after
July 28, 2018, pursuant to a lease agreement between the Landlord and the
Tenant signed on April 15, 2016.
 
3.      The
term of the lease is for two years and 3 months from April 15, 2016, a date
which was amended in writing to May 3, 2016. The sale transaction was not
completed until July 28, 2018, at which time the parties (Landlord and Tenant)
signed an addendum confirming that the effective date of the lease agreement
was July 28, 2016. It is unclear whether the term of the lease was intended to
be for two years instead of 27 months, but for purposes of this order I will
assume that the term continued to be 27 months.
 
4.      The
addendum provided that the first and last month rent were paid by way of the
statement of adjustments on the closing of the sale transaction.
 
5.      The
Addendum required the Tenant to provide post-dated cheques in the amount of
$2,350.00 each for the first 12 months of the lease and in month 11 of the
lease, a further 12 postdated cheques in the amount of $2,350.00 each for the
rent.
 
6.      The
Tenant provided the first set of cheques as required, and they were cashed by
the Landlord. The Tenant provided a further series of cheques, the last one
being on December 28, 2017 for the period ended January 27, 2018.
 
7.      The
Tenant has paid no rent from January 28, 2018 to the date of the hearing except
for one payment on June 28, 2018 in accordance with the interim order issued by
the Board on June 11, 2018.
 
8.      As
at the date of the hearing the unpaid rent was $11,750.00 up to July 27, 2018. 
 
9.      At
the hearing the Tenant’s husband claimed that rent for 15 months had been
prepaid on August 2, 2016. In support of this assertion he produced a photocopy
of a Bank of Montreal draft in the amount of $35,250.00 with the name of the
Landlord’s husband handwritten in as the payee.
 
10.   The
Landlord’s husband denied the assertion made by the Tenant’s husband. It
appears that the parties and their spouses were neighbours and friends in the
past, and that the Landlord’s husband and the Tenant’s husband had a variety of
business and other financial transactions between themselves.
 
11.   The
Landlord’s husband gave evidence that if the photocopy of the bank draft was
genuine and if it represented a payment to him by the Tenant’s husband,  that
was in relation to a different business transaction, having nothing to do with
the tenancy and the rent payable under the lease agreement. 
 
12.   I
find that there was not a pre-payment of rent as alleged by the Tenant’s
husband. The lease agreement and the addendum make no reference to any prepaid
rent, and in fact make it clear that rent was to be paid monthly for the
duration of the lease. Moreover, the Landlord under the lease agreement is the
wife of YH, the alleged payee of the bank draft. 
 
13.   The
Tenant’s husband’s assertion of prepayment for 15 months of rent makes no sense
in the circumstances. The term of the lease was 27 months, with a last month
rent deposit in place. Thus 26 months of rent would be payable under the terms
of the lease. If 15 months were prepaid as alleged, then only 11 months would
have been payable from July 28, 2016 before the prepayment would take effect.
Thus the prepayment period would have begun on June 28, 2017, not on January
28, 2018 which is when the Tenant stopped paying rent.
 
14.   I
find that the Tenant has not paid the total rent she was required to pay for
the period from January 28, 2018 to July 27, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination.
15.   The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $2,350.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
16.   Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 29, 2016 to
July 31, 2018.
 
17.   I
invited the Tenant’s representative to make submissions pursuant to S. 83 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). His submissions were, in
essence, that I should refuse to grant eviction by reason of the alleged
pre-payment of rent. There was no payment plan suggested concerning repayment
of the arrears, nor was any delay of eviction requested.
 
18.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before August 11, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $9,321.98*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to July 27, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $61.81 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting July 28, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before August
11, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from August 12, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before August 11, 2018, then starting August 12,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after August 12, 2018.
 
8.      If,
on or before August 11, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $14,290.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
 
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if she pays the amount required under that subsection on or
after August 12, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
