Order under Section 21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-91499-17-RV
 










 
 

Review Order
 
A..C.L.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict N.O
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. (L1
application)
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying her rent. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit
after the termination date. (L2 application)
 
This
application was resolved by order TSL-91499-17 issued on March 12, 2018.
 
On
March 19, 2018, the Tenant requested a review of the order, and that the order
be stayed until the request to review is resolved.
 
On
March 19, 2018 order TSL-91499-18-RV-IN was issued, staying order TSL-91499-17.
 
The
request was heard in Toronto on April 17, 2018.
 
The
Landlord’s representative, D.R, and the Tenant attended the hearing.       
 
Determinations:
 
Review
1.      The
Tenant’s request to review order TSL-91499-17 is based on the grounds that she
was not reasonably able to participate in the proceedings.
2.      At
the hearing the Tenant testified that she did not receive the Notice of Hearing
and application and that is why she did not attend the hearing on March 8,
2018. The Tenant testified that her mailbox is not secure and she often does
not receive her mail, although she did receive the N4 notice of termination and
she did receive order TSL-91499-17 in the mail. 
3.      Based on
the Tenant’s evidence, which was not contested by the Landlord’s
representative, I stated at the hearing that I am satisfied, on a balance of
probabilities, that the Tenant was not reasonably able to participate in the
proceedings. Accordingly, at the hearing, I granted the Tenant’s request for a
review. The Landlord’s applications proceeded de novo. 
L1
application
4.      The
Tenant did not contest the amount of arrears claimed by the Landlord as of the
date of the hearing.
5.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent he was required to pay for the period from
August 1, 2017 to April 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination effective December 4, 2017.
6.      The Tenant
is in possession of the rental unit. 
7.      The
monthly rent as of the day of the hearing is $1,160.36.
8.      The
Tenant paid $1,150.00 after the application was filed.
9.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
L2
application
10.   It
is uncontested that the Tenant has persistently paid her rent late. 
11.   The
Tenant testified that she paid rent late due to an interruption in her income.
The Tenant testified that she will be able to pay her rent on time from now on.

12.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the
conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of
the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
            Regarding the L1 application
 
1.      The
Tenant’s request for a review is granted.
2.      Order
TSL-91499-17 issued on March 12, 2018 is cancelled and replaced by the
following: 
3.      Unless
the Tenant voids the rent arrears portion of this order as set out below, the
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before May 1, 2018.
4.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,252.73*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to April 20, 2018.
5.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $38.15 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting April 21, 2018 to the date he moves out of the unit.
6.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
7.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before May 1, 2018, then starting May 2, 2018,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
8.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 2, 2018.
9.      If
the Tenant wishes to void the rent arrears portion of this order and continue
the tenancy, she must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $5,920.24 if the payment is made on or before April 30, 2018, or
ii)       $7,080.60 if the payment is made on or before May 1, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
10.   The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside the rent arrears portion of this order if she pays the amount required
under that subsection on or after May 2, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this
motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
Regarding the L2

continuing thereafter until and including April 1, 2019.
12.   If
the Tenant fails to make any of the payments at paragraph 11 above, the
Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Act, within 30 days of the breach and
without notice to the Tenant, for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting
the Tenant.
