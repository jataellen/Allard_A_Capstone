Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-94869-18
 











 
 
 

[NUMBERED COMPANY]. (the 'Landlord') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict W. M. (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Whitby on October 5,
2018.
 
The Landlord’s corporate owner, K.
P., the Landlord’s property manager, J. L., and the Tenant attended the hearing.

 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from August 1, 2018 to
October 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 8, 2018.
2.     
The outstanding arrears
owing for the period ending October 31, 2018, total $5,100.00. 
3.     
The Landlord paid $175.00
for the costs of filing the application and the Landlord is entitled to be
reimbursed for those costs. 
4.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,700.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 5, 2018 to September 8, 2018,
in the amount of $5.53.
6.     
The Tenant gave several
reasons to explain why she has not paid any rent since July 2018. First, the
Tenant says that she was off work for three weeks due to a workplace injury.
Second, she says that she was confused when the Landlord retained August’s rent
as a last month’s rent deposit. Finally, she says her son was supposed to live
in the basement and contribute to the rent but the basement was full of mould
and was uninhabitable for several months. 
7.     
For the following reasons, I
find that the Tenant has led insufficient evidence to establish any legitimate
reason for failing to pay rent for the last 3 months and I find the Tenant not
to be credible. 
8.     
First, the Tenant says that
she, her adult daughter and her husband currently live in the rental unit. The
Tenant says that she makes $1,800.00 per month from employment and her daughter
makes $1,600.00 per month for her employment. Even if what the Tenant says is
true and she missed 3 weeks of work due to an injury, the Tenant failed to explain
why she did not contribute any of her remaining income over the last three
months towards the rent. The Tenant also failed to explain why her daughter has
not contributed any of her income towards the monthly rent for the last three
months. For these reasons, I find the Tenant’s testimony not to be credible on
this point. 
9.     
The Tenant says she was
confused when the Landlord retained August’s rent as a last month’s rent
deposit. Even if what the Tenant says is true, she failed to provide any
explanation regarding why she failed to pay any rent for September or October
2018. For this reason, I find the Tenant’s testimony not to be credible on this
point. 
10.  
Finally, the Tenant says
that the basement was so full of mould that it was uninhabitable and her son
was unable to move into the basement and contribute to the rent. In support of
her testimony, the Tenant called the Landlord’s property manager, ‘JL’, as a
witness. 
11.  
JL denies that the basement
was uninhabitable and she denies seeing the widespread mould the Tenant
describes. Instead, JL confirms that she saw a small area of mould around the
drain in the basement bathroom and she saw what could have been fresh drywall
in the basement. The Tenant says this drywall was put up by her son in an
effort to clean the mould and make the basement more livable.
12.  
The Landlord says that he
took the Tenant on a tour of the entire house before she moved in and neither
he nor the Tenant saw any mould in the basement. The Landlord admits that the
basement is not finished and is not ideal for sleeping. However, as the main
floor has 3 bedrooms, the Landlord says his understanding was that the 4 adults
would be sleeping on the main floor and would simply use the basement for
storage. In other words, the Landlord says there is no reason why the Tenant’s
son could not have moved into one of the main floor bedrooms and contributed to
the monthly rent as planned. 
13.  
In addition, the Landlord
says that, as he owns several rental properties, if there was mould present in
the basement, he would have contacted his property manager immediately to
remedy the situation. 
14.  
Even though the Tenant
describes a vivid scene of widespread mould and then a large construction
project undertaken by her son to correct the mould, she provided no documentary
evidence in support of her testimony. The Tenant failed to provide the Board
with any pictures of the mould or the construction project she describes. The
Tenant failed to provide precise details regarding when the construction
project began and concluded. The Tenant’s testimony regarding the mould was
also inconsistent and lacked specific details. The Tenant also failed to call
her son as a witness to confirm her description of the facts. In the absence of
supporting documentation and in the face of the Landlord’s testimony and JL’s
testimony, I find the Tenant’s testimony not to be credible on this point. 
15.  
However, even if what the
Tenant says is true and there was mould in the basement, the Tenant failed to
provide an explanation regarding why her son could not simply move into one of
the main floor bedrooms and contribute to the monthly rent as planned. 
16.  
As the Tenant’s testimony
was not credible and as she failed to provide any valid explanation for not
having paid any rent since July 2018, I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before October
30, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $2,733.08*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to October 19, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $55.89 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
October 20, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before October 30, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
October 31, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before October 30, 2018, then starting October 31, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after October 31, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before October 30,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $5,275.00** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection
74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under
that subsection on or after October 31, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this
motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
