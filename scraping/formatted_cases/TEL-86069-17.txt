D.L.
and G.R. (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict A.J. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
At
the hearing the Tenant applied pursuant to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order determining that the
Landlord failed to meet the Landlord’s maintenance obligations or failed to
comply with health, safety, housing or maintenance standards and that the
Landlord entered her rental unit illegally and the Landlord or the Landlord's
superintendent or the Landlord's agent substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenant or
by a member of the Tenant's household and withheld or deliberately interfered
with the reasonable supply of a vital service.
 
This
application was heard in Whitby on January 3, 2018.
 
The second-named Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.  S.A.
(the ‘Witness’) also attended the hearing on behalf of the Tenant.
 
Determinations:
 
THE
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from September 1, 2017 to January 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective November 16, 2017.
2.      The
Landlords collected a rent deposit of $1,765.00 from the Tenant and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlords.
3.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 30, 2017 to
November 16, 2017.
4.      The
Tenant disputed the amount of the monthly rent stating she believes it to be
$1,515.00 and not $1,765.00 as listed by the Landlords.  The Tenant further
stated that she believes the initial next to the rental amount on the least has
been forged by the Landlords.  
5.      The
Landlord in attendance said that the lease has not been tampered with and the
amount was always $1,765.00.  
6.      The
Witness said she was present during the Tenant’s move in and the rent was
$1,515.00.  She had a conversation with the second-named Landlord at the time
about how high the rent was and the payment the Tenant made was counted in
front of her.
7.      The
Tenant provided a text message exchange between herself and the Witness about
the rental amount being $1,515.00 but I find the question in the text to be
leading as opposed to having the Witness state what she actually heard the rent
to be.  For this reason, I am not satisfied the rent is $1,515.00.  
8.      Furthermore,
the text exchange with the first-named Landlord and the Tenant indicates the
Tenant withheld $500.00 in rent for September, 2017.  The Landlord clearly
states the remaining amount left from the $1,200.00 payment made by the Tenant
to be $565.00, which supports the monthly rent the Landlords have claimed in
their application.
9.      The
monthly rent for the rental unit is $1,765.00.
THE
TENANT’S SECTION 82 CLAIMS
10.   When
the Tenant notified the Board she had issues under section 82 of the Act the
application was held down to allow the Tenant to tell the second-named Landlord
of her list of issues and provide the Landlord with disclosure.  
11.   When
the parties came before the Board the Landlord was asked whether she was ready
to proceed with the hearing and she indicated she was ready to proceed.  The
hearing went ahead.
12.   The
Tenant brought forward a number of issues, which include the following:
a)    Roaches;
b)    Rats;
c)    Porch
disrepair;
d)    Lack
of gas in the rental unit;
e)    Items
disposed of by the Landlord; 
f)     Harassment
from the basement tenant; and
g)    Illegal
entry.
13.   The
Tenant requested a remedy in the amount of $18,180.00 for her section 82
issues.
Roaches
14.   The
Tenant noticed roaches in her rental unit on July 1, 2017 and verbally notified
the first-named Landlord on July 20, 2017.  The Tenant testified that when she
told the first-named Landlord he responded with ‘oh no’, but no action was
taken at that time.  
15.   The
Tenant sent a text to the first-named Landlord on August 10, 2017.  She also
had a conversation over text with the Landlord on September 13, 2017, of which
she submitted a copy of to the Board.  Since the first-named Landlord was not
in attendance, I find the Tenant’s testimony to be reliable.
16.   The
pictures provided by the Tenant show swarms of roaches in numerous areas of her
rental unit.  The roaches are small and large.  It is evident there is a
serious roach problem within the unit.  The Tenant had the City of Oshawa (the
‘City’) attend the rental unit and the City issued an order with a list of
infractions; one being the “massive cockroach and mouse/rat infestation” in the
rental unit.
17.   The
Landlord submitted a copy of notices to enter the rental unit and the Tenant
did not allow entry during those times.  More specifically for September 5,
2017 and December 11, 2017.  On November 09, 2017 the pest control company did
perform cockroach removal.  The Landlord also stated she believes the reason
the roaches were in the unit was due to the Tenant’s lack of cleaning; however,
provided no evidence to support this statement.
18.   When
asked how the pest control company was not allowed entry into the rental unit
on September 5 and December 11 the Landlord in attendance said the Tenant did
not let the pest control company in.  The Tenant testified that she was not at
home during the visits. 
19.   A
tenant does not have to be present to allow an agent of a landlord into the
rental unit.  It is a landlord’s responsibility to let in any agents attending
the unit to perform work within the rental unit after 24 hours’ notice is given
by the landlord.
20.   The
fact that the Landlords did not attend with the pest control company to allow
them in is not the fault of the Tenant.  The lack of entry on September 5 and
December 11 falls under the Landlords’ responsibility and I will not penalize
the Tenant for these times.  Rather, I view them as inaction by the Landlords.
21.   For
this reason, I am satisfied the Tenant notified the Landlords of the roach
issue on July 20, 2017 and the Landlords did not take action until November 9,
2017.  The Tenant testified to the roaches being throughout her rental unit and
that she had a young child living under these circumstances.  
22.   The
Tenant notified the Landlords of the roach issue July 20, 2017 and the
Landlords had a pest control treat once on November 9, 2017.  The Landlords did
not deal with the issue appropriately after that date.  Another inspection
and/or a follow up would be expected but did not happen.  
23.   Remedy
in the form of abatement is addressed further on in this order under the
heading of remedies.
Rats 
24.   The
Tenant testified that there was a rat in her son’s crib.  She has cleaned rat
feces from the crib and believes the rats are getting in through a large hole
in the wall.  
25.   The
Tenant submitted a picture of a large rodent, which she says is a rat, in her
cupboard.  She also provided pictures of items, such as a vinegar jug, with
what looks to be scratched holes in the side.  
26.   The
Tenant texted the first-named Landlord on August 13, 2017 about the rats in the
unit.  The rats are also mentioned in the text to the Landlord on September 13,
2017, and based on the statement from the Tenant in the text message; it seems
that this text was the first communication regarding the rats.
27.   The
second-named Landlord said the pest control company that was hired to attend
the unit does extermination of all pests, including rodents.  The invoice the
Landlord submitted; however, shows that the pest control company only treated
for roaches.
28.   The
Tenant said there was steel wool stuffed into the hole in her son’s room to prevent
them from re-entering the room.  She also found a nest in a shirt with dead
baby rats inside.  The City’s report notes this as an issue as stated above in
paragraph 16.
29.   Remedy
in the form of abatement is addressed further on in this order under the heading
of remedies.
Porch disrepair
30.   The
Tenant said her foot went through the porch and requested maintenance on the
porch.  On October 10, 2017, she talked to the Landlords’ maintenance man about
the porch.  This item is also on the City report.
31.   The
second-named Landlord submitted a copy of a renovation contract signed January
28, 2017 claiming there was no disrepair to the porch because it was addressed
by the contractor.  The agreement talks about ‘steps outside’ but does not
state any work to be completed regarding the porch itself.
32.   I
am satisfied there was disrepair to the porch and the remedy for same is
addressed below.
No Gas in the Rental Unit
33.   The
Tenant claims there was no gas in the rental unit for the first 6 weeks of her
tenancy.  She would go to a friend’s home to bath her son and herself.  
34.   The
gas was not on at the commencement of the tenancy and was turned on August 12,
2017.  The Landlord did not dispute this claim. 
35.   The
Witness testified that she had cleaned the rental unit for the Landlords prior
to the Tenant moving in.  There was no hot water when she was cleaning.
36.   Gas
is considered a vital service under subsection 2(1) of the Act.  Without gas
going to the rental unit the Tenant would have no hot water.
37.   Pursuant
to subsection 21(1),
A
landlord shall not at any time during a tenant’s occupancy of a rental unit and
before the day on which an order evicting the tenant is executed, withhold
the reasonable supply of any vital service, care service or food that it is
the landlord’s obligation to supply under the tenancy agreement or deliberately
interfere with the reasonable supply of any vital service, care service or
food.
[Emphasis
added]
38.   The
Landlords knew the gas was not on in the rental unit at the onset of the
tenancy.  To have this vital service off for over 6 weeks is unreasonable.  The
second-named Landlord provided no evidence to explain why the gas was off other
than to say the first-named Landlord dealt with the issue.
39.   Based
on the testimony of both parties I am satisfied the Tenant had no gas in her
rental unit for the first 43 days of the tenancy.  Furthermore, I view the
unreasonable amount of time to have it turned on, and the lack of evidence
provided by the Landlord to explain why, constitutes withholding the vital
service and/or deliberately interfering with the vital service.  The remedy for
this issue is discussed below.
Items Disposed of by the
Landlords
40.   The
Tenant claims the second-named Landlord attended the rental unit and took her
items from the lawn and other items that went missing.  The items included a
large cat scratch post, a wheelchair, and her son’s toys.  
41.   The
second-named Landlord said she had a company called East-West Services Company
to go to the unit and remove the items from the lawn due to a complaint received
from the Tenant.  She also provided a copy of the invoice from this company
regarding the pickup.  
42.   The
Tenant said she watched the Landlord dispose of the items.  I find it difficult
to believe that the Tenant would not vehemently object if she saw her items
being thrown out.  For this reason, no remedy is awarded for this item.
 
Harassment from Basement
Tenant
43.   The
Tenant said the basement tenant has been harassing her and even left a notice
to enter saying he was doing it on behalf of the Landlords.  The Landlords were
not notified of the issue prior to the hearing.  For this reason, this issue is
dismissed.
Illegal Entry
44.   Lastly,
the Tenant said the second-named Landlord entered the rental unit.  
45.   On
one occasion the maintenance man told the Tenant to move boxes from where the
electrical panel was and the only way the Landlord would have known it was
there was if she entered the rental unit.  
46.   The
second incident was when she entered the rental unit on August 10, 2017 and the
Tenant’s son saw her there.
47.   The
Landlord testified that she did not enter the rental unit illegally at any
time.  
48.   On
any application before the Board the person making an allegation bears the
burden of proof. This means the Tenant must lead sufficient evidence to
establish that it is more likely than not that the Landlord entered the rental
unit illegally as she alleges. Here, the evidence is essentially equal but
opposite which means the Tenant has failed to meet her burden of proof. 
Remedies
49.   With
respect to quantum of the abatement to be awarded the Board takes into account
criteria that include things like the impact on the Tenant, the length of time
the problem persisted, the nature of the problem and the behaviour complained
of, and the Landlord’s efforts to mitigate the tenant’s damages.
50.   Given
the lack of action taken by the Landlords regarding the cockroaches and rats,
and the Tenant’s evidence as to how upsetting it was, and my knowledge of
previous like cases before the Board, I believe an appropriate abatement for the
period of July 20, 2017 to the date of the hearing is 30% of the rent charged
or $2,924.58.  This 30% abatement of rent shall continue until a pest control
company reports the rental unit is free of pests and vermin.  The rent less 30%
is $1,235.50.
51.   Regarding
the lack of the vital service of gas for 43 days and the absence of evidence
from the Landlords to mitigate the situation, I believe an appropriate
abatement of the rent would be about 35% of the rent charged for the period July
1, 2017 to August 12, 2017 or $873.31. An order shall issue accordingly.
52.   Other
than falling through the porch, the Tenant did not provide any other impact the
disrepair caused on her day to day life.  For this reason a flat abatement
amount in the amount of $100.00 as a percentage would not reflect an
appropriate remedy for this item.
53.   The
Tenant also requested the Landlords be ordered to fix the issues mentioned in
the Tenant’s claim, but also mentioned in the City report.  An order shall
issue directing the Landlord to fix the issues.  
Relief from Eviction
54.   The
Landlord requested an order with standard terms to pay the amount owed to the
Landlords or to vacate the rental unit.  The Tenant asked for a repayment plan
that lasts a year.  
55.   Based
on the ongoing breach of the Landlords’ obligations under the Act and the
second-named Landlord’s action only after being given a report from the City
and now responding to the Tenant’s section 82 claims at the Board, relief from
eviction is warranted in the way of a repayment plan.
56.   The
Tenant did not give the Board dates she would be able to pay the amounts.  The
Tenant only told the Board she wanted a year to pay the amount outstanding. 
The Tenant is on Ontario Works which is paid out once a month.  The household
income is $2,700.00.  To simply allow the Tenant to pay the outstanding amount all
at once would not be reasonable.  Keeping this in mind, the payments ordered
shall be in tandem with the monthly rent payments. 
57.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act.
58.   This
order contains all of the reasons for my decision within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.  
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The
Landlords shall have a pest control company attend the rental unit to treat for
roaches and rats on or before February 26, 2018.
2.     The
Landlords shall continue to have a pest control company attend the rental unit
as the pest company prescribes in order to rid the rental unit of roaches and rats. 

3.     The
monthly rent shall be $1,765.00 less 30% or $529.50 for a total of $1,235.50,
until a pest control company reports the rental unit is free of roaches and
rats.
4.     Once
the rental unit has been deemed free of roaches and rats, the Landlords shall
provide a copy of this report to the Tenant and the monthly rent shall return
to $1,765.00 the month following the date of the pest control report. 
5.     The
Landlords shall repair the porch on or before February 26, 2018.
6.     The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $3,917.11 for arrears of rent to January 31,
2018, plus costs, less abatement of rent.
7.     The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlords the amount set out above in paragraph 1 in
accordance with the following schedule:
a)    $326.43
on or before February 23, 2018;
b)    $326.43
on or before March 1, 2018;
c)    $326.43
on or before April 1, 2018;
d)    $326.43
on or before May 1, 2018;

on or before June 1, 2018;

on or before July 1, 2018;
g)    $326.43
on or before August 1, 2018;
h)    $326.43
on or before September 1, 2018;
i)     $326.43
on or before October 1, 2018;
j)      $326.43
on or before November 1, 2018;
k)    $326.43
on or before December 1, 2018; and
l)      $326.38
on or before January 1, 2019.
8.     The
Tenant shall also pay the rent for February, 2018 on or before February 23,
2018.
9.     The
Tenant shall also pay the monthly rent on or before the first day of every
month beginning March 1, 2018 until January 1, 2019.
10.  If the
Tenant fails to make any one of the payments in accordance with this order, the
outstanding balance of any arrears of rent and costs to be paid by the Tenant
to the Landlord pursuant to paragraph 6 of this order shall become immediately
due and owing and the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to the
Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenant and requiring that the Tenant pay any new arrears, NSF
fees and related charges that became owing after January 31, 2018.
