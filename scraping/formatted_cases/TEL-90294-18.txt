G.D.A. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict K.L. and C.O.C.M. (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on May 16, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, S.K.,
the first-named Tenant and the Tenant’s mother, N.M., attended the hearing. 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid the
total rent they were required to pay for the period from March 1, 2018 to May
31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective March 28, 2018.
2.     
The outstanding arrears
owing for the period ending May 31, 2018, total $3,406.58. 
3.     
The Landlord paid $190.00
for the costs of filing the application and the Landlord is entitled to be
reimbursed for those costs. 
4.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,143.42 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2018 to March 28, 2018,
in the amount of $4.91.
6.     
Over the course of the
hearing, the Tenant presented testimony that was somewhat unclear and continued
to evolve under questioning from the Board and the Landlord’s representative.
However, by the conclusion of the hearing, there were several facts that are
not in dispute. 
7.     
The Tenant does not dispute
that he cannot afford the rental unit on his own. The Tenant relies on the help
of his roommate who is currently out of the country. There is no dispute that,
when the roommate returns, she will be unemployed. There is also no dispute
that the Tenant suffers from various mental health concerns which have affected
the stability of his employment in the past. This is one factor that led the
arrears to accumulate. There is no dispute that the arrears are substantial and
the Landlord is holding a last month’s rent deposit. 
8.     
The Tenant says that he is
working in a more stable environment, his roommate will likely find a job
quickly when she returns, and once that happens, they can pay the rent and the
outstanding arrears. Despite the Tenant’s optimism, he presented no concrete
plan or proposal at the hearing to substantiate his testimony. In other words,
there is no way to know whether his roommate will obtain employment, whether
his own employment will work out or whether the Tenants can pay the outstanding
arrears. 
9.     
The Tenant is seeking relief
in the form of a delay until June 30, 2018, to allow him and his roommate an
opportunity to find a new place to live. I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). Based on the Tenant’s mental health
concerns which may affect his ability to search for a new place to live, and
based on the fact that the Landlord is holding a last month’s rent deposit, I find
that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until June 30, 2018, pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before June 30,
2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $1,030.73*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to May 25, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $37.57 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting May 26, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 5, 2018, the Tenants will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June 6,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 30, 2018, then starting July 1, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 1, 2018.
8.     
If the Tenants wish to void
this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust:
i)        $3,596.58 if the payment is made on or before May 31, 2018, or
ii)       $4,739.44 if the payment is made on or before June 30, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after July 1, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
