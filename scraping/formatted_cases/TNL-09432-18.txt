Order
under Section 87(1)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-09432-18



 


 


 



 
 
 (SK)
and (AM) (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict MTES and AMB (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent
that the Tenants owe.
 
The
Landlords also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenants because the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for the
purpose of residential occupation. The Landlords also claimed compensation for
each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This
application was heard in Newmarket on October 31, 2018.
 
The Landlords, the Landlords’ representative, MY, and the Tenants
attended the hearing.
 
 Determinations:
 
1.      The
rental unit is a 3 bedroom apartment located on the upper west side of the
residential complex. The Tenants occupy the rental unit with their 2 children
aged 8 and 11 years.
 
2.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from April 1, 2018 to October 31, 2018.
 
3.      The
Tenants have fallen behind on the rent because the male Tenant was unemployed
for a period of time. He is now employed and the Tenants can pay the rent and
arrears, provided they are able to do so over a period of several months. 
 
4.      In
addition to the Tenants’ unit, there is another unit on the upper east side of
the residential complex, and several outbuildings. The Landlords have been
engaged in renovating the unit on the upper east side for many months.  The
unit on the upper east side is also a 3 bedroom apartment with 2 bathrooms, a
kitchen and living room. It is the same size as the Tenants’ unit. It is
currently vacant.
 
5.      The
Landlord AM claims that he requires the Tenants’ rental unit for his own
residential occupation. According to him, he intends to occupy both the upper
east side unit (currently vacant) and the Tenants’ unit for his own residential
use. He intends to occupy these units alone, although he may have his
girlfriend move in with him as well.
 
6.      I
do not consider it plausible that AM will occupy two three bedroom apartments,
each of which has a kitchen and two bathrooms as well as living area. I
consider it unlikely that he will occupy 6 bedrooms, 2 kitchens 4 bathrooms and
2 living rooms, even if his girlfriend moves in with him. 
 
7.      I
find that the Landlord AM does not, in good faith require possession of the
Tenants’ rental unit for his own residential occupation. 
 
8.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act, in relation to the Landlords’ application to terminate the tenancy
for failure to pay rent  
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $7,990.00, which represents the amount of
rent and costs owing up to October 31, 2018 as follows:
 
a)    $800.00
on or before November 20, 2018
b)    $500.00
on or before the first business day of each month from December 2018 to and
including August 2019
c)    $300.00
on or before the 20th  day of each month from December 2018 to and
including July 2019
d)    $290.00
on or before August 20, 2019
 
2.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords the rent for the month of November 2018
on or before November 15, 2018, and the rent for the month of December 2018 and
each month thereafter until the arrears outstanding under paragraph 1 have been
paid in full, on or before the first business day of the month for which the
rent becomes due.
3.      If
the Tenants fail to make any one of the payments in accordance with this order,
the outstanding balance of any arrears of rent and costs to be paid by the
Tenants to the Landlords pursuant to paragraph 1 of this order, together with
simple interest, calculated from the day after default, at 3.00% annually on
the balance outstanding, shall become immediately due and owing and the
Landlords may, without notice to the Tenants, apply to the Board pursuant to
section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting
the Tenants and requiring that the Tenants pay any new arrears, NSF fees and
related charges that become owing after the date of this order.
4.      The
Landlords’ application to terminate the tenancy for the residential use by one
of the Landlords is dismissed.
