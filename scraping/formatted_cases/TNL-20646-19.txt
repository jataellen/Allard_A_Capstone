Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-20646-19
 











 
 
 

CL (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict PK (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has been
persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination
date.
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed administration charges related to NSF
cheques.
 
This application was heard in Newmarket on December
18, 2019.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Landlord served the
Tenant a Notice of Termination because the Tenant did not pay the total rent
the Tenant was required to pay for the period from August 1, 2019 to December
31, 2019.  
 
2.     
The Landlord said that there
were no arrears of rent owing at the date of the hearing.
 
3.     
The Landlord incurred
charges of $20.00 for administration charges related to cheques tendered by or
on behalf of the Tenant, which were returned NSF.
 
4.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,650.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
 
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 1, 2014 to September 4, 2019.
 
6.     
The Tenant has persistently
failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
7.     
The Landlord is seeking
eviction.  She said that throughout 2019 the Tenant either paid late or failed
to pay the rent.  She also said that since the Landlord filed the application,
the Tenant has paid the rent.
 
8.     
The Landlord said that she
is retired and relies on the rent income in order to pay the mortgage on the
residential complex.  She said that she defaulted on her mortgage payment in
August.  She said that she is seriously considering selling the property
because of the financial problems caused by the Tenant’s late payments.
 
9.     
The Tenant admits that he
held back rent because the Landlord would not give him an address where he
could serve documents.
 
10.  
The Tenant said that he
works part time as an insurance appraiser and he went back to work full-time in
October, 2019, as an automotive tester.  He said that he has sufficient income
to pay the rent on time since he has had the two jobs.
 
11.  
The Tenant said that he wants
to remain in the rental unit.  He said that it is affordable, and convenient
for his work.  He said that he is having a difficult time at the moment, with a
daughter who is seriously ill, and it would be very difficult to move.
 
12.   I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to the conditions set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.  The Tenant said that he
is able to pay the full rent on time, going forward, and he has demonstrated
that he has the income and ability to do this by paying the full rent, on time,
for the previous three months.  The Tenant is having a difficult time in his
personal and family circumstances, and he should be given an opportunity to
preserve his tenancy with an order to pay the rent on time going forward.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Commencing February, 2020,
and continuing up to and including January, 2021, the Tenant shall pay the rent, in full, no later than the
first day of each of those months, respectively.
 
2.     
Section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 applies to paragraph 1 of this order. If the Tenant
fails to make any payment, the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant,
apply to the Board for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenant. The Landlord must make this application no later than 30 days after the
Tenant fails to make a payment. 
 
3.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application, as well as $20.00 for
the NSF charges incurred by the Landlord.
 
4.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount of $210.00 owing on or before February 2, 2020, they
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
February 3, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
