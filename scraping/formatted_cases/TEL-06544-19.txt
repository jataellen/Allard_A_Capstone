Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-06544-19
 











 
 

INC. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict J. H. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Belleville on January
23, 2020.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant
attended the hearing. The Tenant was assisted
by his friend, M. P. 
 
Acknowledgement: 
 

The parties agree to have the Tenant ’s
     minor son, J. H., removed from the application as a named party. 

 
Determinations:
 
            TENANT’S REQUEST FOR AN
ADJOURNMENT 
 
1.    The Tenant came before the Board, after consulting
with Tenant Duty Counsel, seeking an adjournment on the basis that he wanted to
raise his own issues, namely, the lack of a window in the rental unit and mould
in the rental unit, and needed time to call the by-law officer and prepare his evidence.

2.    Section 82 of the RTA states: 
82 (1) At a hearing of an application by a landlord under section 69 for
an order terminating a tenancy and evicting a tenant based on a notice of
termination under section 59, the Board shall permit the tenant to raise any
issue that could be the subject of an application made by the tenant under this
Act.  
 
(2) If a tenant raises an issue under subsection (1), the Board may make
any order in respect of the issue that it could have made had the tenant made
an application under this Act.
3.    I denied the adjournment request.  Parties are
generally expected to come to their hearing prepared to proceed.  Section 82
gives the Tenant the right to raise his own claims during a hearing about rent arrears,
but he was not prepared to exercise that right.  Section 82 does not entitle him
to delay the Landlord’s case in order to bring her own case.
4.    The Tenant is free to raise his claims by filing
applications with the Board.  His claims will then be heard at a date when he
is ready to proceed.  
5.     After I denied the adjournment request, I gave the
Tenant the opportunity to speak to Duty Counsel regarding the application for rent
arrears, before we proceeded. 
APPLICATION FOR ARREARS OF RENT
6.    The Tenant has not paid the total rent the
Tenant was required to pay for the period from February 1, 2019 to January 31,
2020.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective November 7, 2019.
7.    The Tenants paid $1,050.00 after the application
was filed.
8.    The arrears and costs owing to January 31, 2020 total
$3,525.00. 
9.    The Landlord seeks a standard, voidable eleven-day
order. 
TENANT’S REQUEST FOR RELIEF
10. The Tenant does not dispute the amount outstanding. He testified
that the reason he fell into arrears is because he lost his job in August 2019.
This is consistent with the N4 notice of termination that was filed with the Board.
11. The Tenant testified that he started working again at the end
of November, which is how he was able to make a payment in December towards the
rent arrears. 
12. The Tenant seeks an opportunity to preserve his tenancy and
proposed a repayment plan of an additional $50.00 on top of his rent every month
for the next seventy-one months. In the event a payment plan is not granted, the
Tenant seeks a delay in eviction of 30 days so that he is able to save first and
last month’s rent and make alternative living arrangements 
13. The Tenant testified that his household income is $1,800.00
and that he does not receive any other income aside from this. His total household
expenses are $2,320.00 which is inclusive of the rent, groceries, carpooling costs,
credit card debt, furniture payments, cellphone, internet and pet expenses. 
14. He lives in the rental unit alone where his son stays with him
every other weekend. 
15. Upon cross examination, it appeared that the Tenant had made
a proposal of paying between $200-250 in addition to the monthly rent back in December
2019. When asked what had changed, his evidence was that the plan he had proposed
today would be more realistic for him. 
16. The Landlord opposes the Tenant’s request for a repayment plan
as no payments have been received by the Landlord towards the arrears or the rent
since December 2019, even though the Tenant has been employed for the past two months.

ANALYSIS
17. The trouble with the Tenant’s proposed repayment plan is that
if the Tenant’s expenses are subtracted from his income, it appears the Tenant is
already overspending by $520.00 every month. I asked the Tenant how he would be
able to make an additional $50.00 every month; his response was that he would have
to prioritize these payments over others.
18. The concern that I have with the Tenant’s repayment plan is
that his income appears to be insufficient to meet both the Tenant’s ongoing monthly
expenses and the payments towards the arrears. In other words, it appears that the
Tenant is unable to afford this rental unit. 
19. Therefore, I find that awarding a repayment plan under the circumstances
would be unfair. I can however consider whether to postpone the eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. 
20. While the Landlord seeks a standard, voidable eleven-day order,
the Landlord was not opposed to the Tenant ’s request for a delay in eviction by
30 days. I do not find this request to be unreasonable given that the Tenant has
lived in the rental unit for over a year. 
21.  Since the hearing date, the rent for February 2020 has also
come due. 
22.  An order shall issue accordingly. 
23. The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $850.00 from the
Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
24. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for
the period from September 30, 2018 to November 7, 2019.
25. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction
until March 3, 2020 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
26. This order contains all of the reasons for my
decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.   
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The application is amended to
remove the Tenant’s minor child, J. H., as a named Tenant.
2.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before March 2,
2020.
3.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $2,588.30*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to February 3, 2020, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $27.95 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
February 4, 2020 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
5.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
6.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 14, 2020, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
February 15, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
7.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 2, 2020, then starting March 3, 2020, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
8.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 3, 2020.
9.     
If the Tenants wish to
void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord
or to the Board in trust:
i)        $4,375.00 if the payment is made on or before February 29, 2020, or
ii)       $5,225.00 if the payment is made on or before March 2, 2020**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
10.  
The Tenants may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March 3, 2020 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
