Landlord’s L1 application.
C.J. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict A.M and N.M. (the 'Tenants')
because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
Landlord’s L2 application.
C.J. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict A.M and N.M. (the 'Tenants')
because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in
the residential complex have used
the rental unit or the residential complex in a manner that is inconsistent
with use as a residential premises and that has caused or can be expected to
cause significant damage. 
 
These applications were heard
in Toronto on January 23, 2019.
 
Only the Landlord and the
Landlord’s representative M.I. attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
With respect to the
Landlord’s L1 application, the
Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the
period from August 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 28, 2018.
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,500.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from July 1, 2017 to September 28, 2018.
4.     
The Tenants paid $5,459.02
after the application was filed.
5.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
6.     
With respect to the
Landlord’s L2 application, the
Landlord served the Tenant with an N7 notice on September 7, 2018 alleging that
the Tenant was using the property in a manner not consistent with residential
usage.
7.     
The Landlord was unable to
provide any evidence in support of this and as a result the notice was
dismissed along with the L2 application.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before February
11, 2019.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $2,053.13*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to January 31, 2019, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $49.32 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting February 1, 2019 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 11, 2019, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
February 12, 2019 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 11, 2019, then starting February 12, 2019, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 12, 2019.
8.     
If the Tenants wish to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $3,730.98 if the payment is made on or before January 31, 2019, or
ii)       $5,230.98 if the payment is made on or before February 11, 2019**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after February 12,
2019 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
