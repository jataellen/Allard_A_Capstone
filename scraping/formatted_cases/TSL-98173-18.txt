Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-98173-18
 










 
 
 

#.O.I.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict J.T
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on September 10, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, A.X and the Landlord`s legal
representative, I.S (“IS”) and the Tenant (who was self-represented) attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from September 1, 2014 to September 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 5, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenant remains in possession of the residential unit where he lives alone.
 
3.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $475.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
4.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 1, 2013 to
August 5, 2018.
 
5.      IS,
on behalf of the Landlord, submitted a written summary of the Landlord’s
financial claims for arrears of rent, showing a total amount owing of $4,565.00
inclusive of the filing fee.  IS requested a standard, voidable order of
termination within 11 days.
 
6.      The
Tenant did not dispute the Landlord’s financial claims, but requested a payment
plan over the course of the next 11 months to allow him to pay off the total
amount.  This proposal involves a payment of $300.00 as of the hearing date; a
payment of $1,000.00 on October 1, 2018 ($475.00 as payment of his monthly rent
and $525.00 toward the arrears); and payments of $770.83 ($475.00 for monthly
rent and $295.83 toward arrears) starting November 1, 2018 and continuing for
11 months until the balance is paid.
 
7.      IS,
on behalf of the Landlord, indicated that this proposal was not satisfactory to
the Landlord.
 
8.      The
Tenant explained that until July 2018, he experienced a period of unemployment
from October 2017.  He has now obtained regular employment, paying him
$16.00/hour.
 
9.      He
acknowledged that since re-gaining regular employment in July 2018, he has not
made any payments to the Landlord toward the arrears, noting that he was
advised by legal representatives whom he consulted to amass his money while
this matter was in progress before the Board.  The Tenant further acknowledged
that despite this advice, he only had $300.00 available as a contribution
toward the arrears as of the hearing date.
 
10.   The
Tenant noted that if his proposed payment plain is not granted, he will be
homeless; he has no friends or relatives in the area with whom he can stay.  
 
11.   IS,
for the Landlord highlighted that the arrears in this matter are substantial
and have been outstanding since 2014.   He noted the Tenant has made no good
faith efforts to make any payment toward the arrears –despite his July 2018
re-employment – until his $300.00 offer at the hearing.
 
12.   Having
considered the totality of evidence, I am not persuaded that the Tenant’s
proposal of a payment plan is realistic or reasonable in this context,
particularly given the substantial amount of arrears and their nearly 4 year duration;
and the Tenant’s limited income from employment. The Tenant has not satisfied
me, on a balance of probabilities, that I should exercise my discretion to
grant the payment plan he has proposed.   To my mind, notwithstanding the
modest rent charged, his longstanding track record of arrears suggests he
cannot afford this tenancy.
 
13.   However,
it seems reasonable to allow him a short delay to allow him to attempt to order
his affairs and to pursue alternative accommodation.
 
14.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until September 30,
2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before September 30, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $3,583.53*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to September 12, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $15.62 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting September 13, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
September 30, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from September 24, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before September 30, 2018, then starting October
1, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after October 1,
2018.
 
8.      If,
on or before October 1, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $4,565.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after September 30, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
