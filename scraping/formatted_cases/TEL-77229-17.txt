Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-77229-17
 










 
 
 

S.A.L..
c/o M.L.M.I.. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict S.D. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on March 8, 2017.
 
The Landlord’s representative, R.A., and the Tenant attended the
hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent he was required to pay for the period from
December 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective January 10, 2017.
2.     
The arrears of rent owing for the
period ending March 31, 2017, total $861.08.
3.     
The Landlord incurred costs as a
result of filing the application in the amount of $170.00 and is entitled to
reimbursement for those costs. 
4.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $879.23 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2017
to January 10, 2017, in the amount of $0.36.
6.      The
Tenant paid $1,759.25 after the application was filed.
7.      At
the hearing the Tenant raised the following issues pursuant to section 82 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). In particular, the
Tenant said that he is having difficulty paying the monthly rent because he
insists on paying in cash and the Landlord is not making themselves available
to receive his cash payments. 
 
8.      The
Tenant says that the Landlord has a property manager on site between the hours
of 9am to 5pm, but these hours overlap with his own business hours such that he
is not able to get to the rental office to pay the rent before the office
closes. 
9.      Section
108 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 20016 (the ‘Act’), states that the
Landlord shall not dictate to the Tenant how the monthly rent is paid; in other
words, if the Tenant wishes to pay the rent in cash, he is legally permitted to
do so. However, there is nothing in the Act which allows the Tenant to dictate
the hours during what that payment must be received. It is up to the Tenant to
make arrangements to ensure that he, or someone acting on his behalf, can
attend the rental office and pay the monthly rent in full and on time. 
10.    Based
on the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the Landlord’s actions are not a
violation of the Act and, as a result, the Tenant’s section 82 issues must be
dismissed. 
11.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It
is ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before March 21, 2017.
2.      As
of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit  plus the {abatement/rebate}
the Landlord owes exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the Landlord is
entitled to by $661.45*.
3.      However,
the Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the
Landlord owes the Tenant:
$28.91 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting March 11, 2017
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit, and
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
4.      The
Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as
a result of this order.
5.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before March 21, 2017, then starting March 22,
2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
6.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 22, 2017.
7.      If,
on or before March 21, 2017, the Tenant pays the amount of $1,051.08** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
8.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after March 22, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
