Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-07341-19
 











 
 

S. B. OPCO 2 ULC (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict P.Y. W. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on January 29,
2020.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant
attended the hearing. The Landlord was represented by J. A.
 
As a result
of a Superior Court of Justice order suspending the enforcement of LTB eviction
orders during the period from March 19, 2020 to July 31, 2020, the issuance of
this Order has been delayed. Any payments made by the Tenant(s) to the Landlord
after the application was filed by the Landlord must deducted from the amount
ordered by the Board. 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from October 1, 2019
to January 31, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective November 19, 2019.
2.     
The lawful monthly rent is
$1,126.83.
3.     
The Tenant paid $1,217.00
after the application was filed.
4.     
There is no dispute that as
of the date of the hearing before the Board the arrears of rent owing total
$2,990.32 for the period ending January 31, 2020.
5.     
The Landlord incurred costs
of $175.00 for filing the application and is entitled to reimbursement of those
costs.
6.     
The total amount the Tenants
owes the Landlord under this order for the period ending January 31, 2020 as of
the date of hearing before the Board is $3,165.32.
7.     
The sole dispute at the
hearing was with respect to the Tenant’s request for relief in the form of a
repayment plan. The Tenant asks for an opportunity to maintain her tenancy and
pay $500.00 towards the rent arrears each month on the 21st day of
the month until the balance is repaid. 
8.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until March 21, 2020 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of
the Act. I say this for the following reasons. 
9.     
The Tenant says she lives in
the rental unit with her daughter who is currently not contributing to
household income. While her daughter was in college, her father was helping to
support her but that stopped when she decided to take a break from college. 
10.  
The Tenant became unemployed
about five years ago, went back to work, had an accident about two years ago
and stopped working. She is in receipt of Ontario Works. About two weeks prior
to the hearing before the Board she started working part time.
11.  
The Tenant has been at the
Board with respect to this tenancy three times. In August of 2019 she was given
an opportunity to save the tenancy with a repayment plan. She had to borrow
money to make those payments and in October of 2019 she failed to pay rent in
full because she was repaying that loan. 
12.  
The fundamental problem with
the Tenant’s request for relief is that the Tenant cannot in fact afford the
re-payment plan she proposes. She cannot afford the unit. Currently her total monthly
household income is about $1,200.00. Her monthly rent is $1,126.83 and her
other expenses total about $445.00. So she cannot afford to pay new rent let
alone something towards the rent arrears. 
13.  
As a result, I find that it
would be unfair to impose on the parties a repayment plan that will inevitably
fail. It would simply result in additional legal proceedings and expense. 
14.  
That being said, the Tenant
has clearly fallen on hard times and is trying to meet her obligations to the
Landlord. The Landlord is not averse to delaying eviction until March 21, 2020.
Therefore, in all of the circumstances I am satisfied it would not be unfair to
delay eviction until March 21, 2020. That will give the Tenant the opportunity
to try and borrow the amount outstanding or find a new home to live in. 
15.  
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,126.83 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord. If the tenancy ends as a result of this order, this amount
shall be deducted from the total owing. 
16.  
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from March 1, 2019 to November 19, 2019
totalling $14.68. If the tenancy ends as a result of this order, this amount
shall also be deducted from the total owing. 
17.  
This order contains all of
the reasons for the decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.
It is ordered that:
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before August
15, 2020.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $8,768.15* (less any payment made by the Tenant to the Landlord after
the hearing of January 29, 2020), which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to August 4, 2020, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $37.05 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
August 5, 2020 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before August 15, 2020, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
August 16, 2020 at .00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before August 15, 2020, then starting August 16, 2020, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after August 16, 2020.
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $3,165.32 (less any payment made by the Tenant to the Landlord after
the hearing of January 29, 2020) if the payment is made on or before January
31, 2020,
ii)       $4,292.15 (less any payment made by the Tenant to
the Landlord after the hearing of January 29, 2020) if the payment is made on
or before February 29, 2020, or
iii)      $5,418.98** (less any payment made by the Tenant
to the Landlord after the hearing of January 29, 2020) if the payment is made
on or before March 21, 2020. 
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with
this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this
order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March 22, 2020 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
10.  
Any payments made by the
Tenant to the Landlord after the hearing held on January 29, 2020, shall be
deducted from the total amount owing under this order.
