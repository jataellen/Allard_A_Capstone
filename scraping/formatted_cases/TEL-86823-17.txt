Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-86823-17
 










 
 
 

B.
A. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict D.
D. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes
and because he has been persistently late in paying the Tenant’s rent. The
Landlord also claimed administration charges related to NSF cheques. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit
after the termination date. 
 
This
application was heard in Whitby on January 22, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, S. B., and the Tenant attended the
hearing. 
 
Determinations:
 
The Application for Non-Payment of Rent
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from October 1, 2014 to January 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective December 4, 2017.
2.      The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending January 31, 2018, total $6,500.00.
3.      The
Landlord incurred costs as a result of filing the application in the amount of
$190.00 and is entitled to reimbursement for those costs. 
4.      The
Landlord incurred charges of $100.00 for administration charges related to
cheques tendered by or on behalf of the Tenant, which were returned NSF.
The
Application for Persistently Late Payment
5.      The
Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
6.      According
to the information provided by the Landlord’s representative, the Tenant has
been late paying his rent 13 times out of 13 since January 2017. 
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). In
particular, I have considered that the Tenant has lived in the rental unit
since 2014 along with his adult son who has special needs. The Tenant’s income
is substantial and he can clearly afford the monthly rent. 
8.      However,
the Tenant says that he has fallen on hard times recently when his father
passed away on December 24, 2017. During that same time period, the Tenant says
he had to give financial assistance to his ailing mother, as well as his
daughter who recently gave birth. Also, during this same time period, the
Tenant says that his vehicle required $5,000.00 in repairs and he discovered
$800.00 in unpaid parking tickets. For all of these reasons, the Tenant says he
has fallen into arrears, although he was able to pay December’s rent in full. 
9.      The
Tenant says that he expects to be able to pay all of the outstanding arrears
when he receives his tax return. The Tenant provided the Board with copies of
his 2013 and 2014 tax assessments which confirm that he has received a
substantial return in the past. However, as the Tenant will not likely obtain a
tax return for several months, it would be unfair to the Landlord delay this
eviction while the Tenant waits for that return. 
10.   The
Tenant also says he had an ongoing verbal agreement with the Landlord and his
son which allowed him to pay his rent late almost every month. Neither the
Landlord nor his son were present at the hearing to confirm this arrangement
although the Landlord’s representative says that there was no such arrangement.
Based on the evidence before me, I am not satisfied on the balance of
probabilities that the parties had an ongoing agreement which allowed the
Tenant to pay his rent late. 
11.   The
Tenant is seeking relief from eviction in the form of either a payment plan or
delay of between 1 to 2 months. I determined at the hearing that the Tenant’s
proposed payment plan was incoherent and he was unable to explain to me the
precise terms of his proposal. Also, as the Landlord is a retired gentleman who
relies on this rental income as a means of monthly support and as the arrears
are close to $7,000.00, I find that it would be unfair to delay this eviction
by more than one month. 
12.   Based
on the circumstances of both parties, I find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until February 28, 2018, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b)
of the Act, subject to the Tenant’s ability to void this order by paying the
outstanding arrears. In addition, if the Tenant is able to void this order, I
find that it would not be unfair to require the Tenant to pay his rent in full
and on time for a 12 month period, subject to the Landlord’s right to file for
eviction in the event of a breach. An order will issue accordingly. 
It
is ordered that:
The
Application for Non-Payment of Rent
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before February 28, 2018.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $6,607.14*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to January 30, 2018 and the total charges related
to NSF cheques tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $42.74 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting January 31, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
February 10, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from February 11, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2018, then starting March 1,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2018.
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $6,790.00 if the payment is made on or before January 31, 2018, or
ii)       $8,090.00 if the payment is made on or before February 28, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after March 1, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
The
Application for Persistently Late Payment
10.   If
the Tenant voids the eviction order for non-payment of rent pursuant to
paragraphs 8 or 9 above then the Tenant shall pay to the Landlord new rent on
time and in full for the period commencing March 1, 2018, to February 28, 2019.

11.   If
the Tenant fails to make any one of the payments in accordance with paragraph
10 of this order the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to the
Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenant and requiring that the Tenant pays any new arrears, NSF
fees and related charges that became owing after February 28, 2018.
