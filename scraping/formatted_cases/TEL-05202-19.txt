Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-05202-19
 











 
 
 

Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict K.A.P. and J.E.S. (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Whitby on November 29,
2019.
 
The Landlord and the Tenants
attended the hearing. The Landlord was represented by B.R. 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September
1, 2019 to November 30, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a
Notice of Termination effective September 22, 2019.
2.     
The Tenants paid $1,550.95 since the application
was filed. 
3.     
The arrears and costs owing to November 30, 2019
total $686.90.
4.     
The Landlord seeks a standard, voidable eleven-day
order.
5.     
The Tenants do not dispute the amount of arrears as claimed
by the Landlord. 
REQUEST FOR RELIEF
6.     
The Tenants testified that the reason they fell into
arrears is because of an issue with their Ontario Works Benefit payments. The second-named Tenant testified that there was a hearing on October
8, 2019 for which a decision is being issued. If the hearing goes in her favour,
she will be able to clear the balance as soon as the funds are released. While the
Tenant is unaware of how much she would receive from the backpay, she testified
that the back payment is owing from February 2018. 
7.     
If not, however, the Tenants seek relief in the form of a repayment plan. The
Tenants proposed to pay
an additional $125.00 on top of their monthly rent to clear the balance of within
six months. The Tenants indicated
that they were more comfortable with additional payments of $100.00 instead of the
$125.00 they discussed with Tenant Duty Counsel. 
8.     
Their total monthly income is approximately $1,349.00
which comprises of the OW payment received. The first-named Tenant is not employed. 
9.     
Their monthly expenses total $1,462.95 which comprises
of their rent, medical supplies as the Tenant has
diabetes, diet expense, utilities and other debt. They have cut off their phone
service since they can no longer afford it.  
10.   The Landlord opposes the Tenants’ repayment plan request as he finds
it to be unrealistic. He submits that when the income is subtracted from the expenses,
it appears that the Tenants are already overspending $113.95 per month. Therefore,
it is unclear how the Tenants will be able to afford a further $100.00 each month
to pay towards the arrears. Furthermore, this is the fifth time that the Tenants
have been brought to the Board on an application for arrears of rent. 
11.   The Tenant ’s response was that it was true that they were on a tight
budget but that they are confident, by cutting out other expenses, they would prioritize
the repayment of the arrears. 
12.   Based on the evidence before the Board, I share the Landlord’s concern
that the Tenants may not have enough income to satisfy the arrears and new rent
that becomes due. However, if what the Tenants is saying is true, then there is
a potential for more income meaning the Tenants may well be able to keep to the
proposed repayment plan or perhaps even pay it off sooner. Thus, to give the Tenants
the benefit of the doubt, their repayment plan is granted. 
13.   If the Tenants have not done so already, the rent payments for the months
of December 2019 through to March 2020 shall be due and payable on or before April
20, 2020. 
14.   I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance
with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction
subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection
83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
15.   This order contains all of the reasons for my decision within it. No
further reasons shall be issued.  
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The arrears and costs owing to
November 30, 2019 total $686.90.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay the
Landlord $686.90 as follows:
a)   
$100.00 on or before April 15,
2020; 
b)   
$100.00 on or before May 1, 2020;

c)   
$100.00 on or before June 1,
2020; 
d)   
$100.00 on or before July 1,
2020; 
e)   
$100.00 on or before August 1,
2020; 
f)    
$100.00 on or before September
1, 2020; 
g)   
$86.90 on or before October 1,
2020; 
3.     
If the Tenants have not already done so, the Tenants shall pay to the Landlord the rent for the months
of December 1, 2019 through to March 1, 2020 in full and no later than April 20,
2020. 
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
the Landlord rent owing for the months of April 1, 2020 through to October 1, 2020
in full and no later than the first day of each month. 
5.     
If the Tenants fails to make
any one of the payments in accordance with paragraphs 2-4 of this order, the
outstanding balance of any arrears of rent and costs to be paid by the Tenants
to the Landlord pursuant to paragraph 1 of this order shall become immediately
due and owing. In addition, the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenants
apply to the Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating
the tenancy and evicting the Tenants and requiring that the Tenants pay any new
arrears, NSF fees and related charges that became owing after November 30, 2019.
