Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-76211-16
 










 
 
 

V.K.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict D.V.K.
and S.K. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.  This is an L1 application.
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenants because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they
permitted in the residential complex have substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or
another tenant.  This is an L2 application.
 
This
combined application was heard in Toronto on February 13, 2017.  Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay
for the period from October 2, 2016 to March 1, 2017.  Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective December 13, 2016.
2.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,460.00 from the
Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
3.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the
period from September 3, 2016 to December 13, 2016.
4.    
The Landlord failed to provide any evidence to support the L2
application.  The allegations are that the Tenants smoke in the residential
complex and the smoking bothers the other tenants.  The Landlord provided text
messages where she accuses the Tenants of smoking and they responded they don’t
know what she is talking about.  The Landlord also supplied text messages from
the other tenants in the complex that accuse the Tenants of smoking but there
is no evidence to support this allegation.
5.    
Based on the L1 application I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.  The Landlord was
not aware of any circumstances that would require me to delay or deny the
eviction.
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below in relation to
the L1 application, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before March 6,
2017.
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $4,907.76*, which represents
the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February 23, 2017, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $48.00 per day for
compensation for the use of the unit starting February 24, 2017 to the date
they move out of the unit.
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $170.00 for the cost of
filing the application.
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on
or before March 6, 2017, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be
simple interest calculated from March 7, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.    
If the unit is not vacated on or before March 6, 2017, then
starting March 7, 2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
March 7, 2017.
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue the tenancy,
they must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)       $7,470.00 if the payment is made on or before March 1, 2017, or
ii)      $8,930.00 if the payment is made on or before March 6, 2017**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that
subsection on or after March 7, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant
possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
10. 
The L2 application is dismissed as the Landlord provided no
evidence to support the allegations as contained in the application or the N5
Notice of Termination.
