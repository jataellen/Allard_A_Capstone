Order under Section 21.2
of the 
Statutory Powers
Procedure Act 
and the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-95667-18-RV
 











 
 

Review Order
 
CHL (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict (CEM) and (OGI) (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did
not pay the rent that the Tenants owe. (L1 application)
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenants because the Tenants have been persistently
late in paying their rent.  The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date. (L2 application)
 
This application was heard on July 19, 2018 and
resolved by order TSL-95667-18 issued on July 25, 2018.
 
On July 26, 2018, the Tenants
requested a review of the order, on the basis that the Tenants were not
reasonably able to participate in the proceeding.
 
An interim order
TSL-95667-18-RV-IN was issued on July 26, 2018 staying the order TSL-95667-18
issued on July 25, 2018.
 
The request for review was heard
on August 17, 2018.  The Landlord’s representative, DC, and one of the Tenants,
(OGI), attended the hearing.
 
I note that the Notice of Hearing
was properly served on all the parties, and there is no adjournment request or
any indication that the Tenants could not attend.  
 
The hearing was scheduled for 9:30
AM.  I waited until 1:40 PM and proceeded to hear the matter without CEM.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The issue before me is
whether the Tenants were not reasonably able to participate in the proceeding
on July 19, 2018.  
2.     
The Tenant CEM failed to
appear at the hearing on July 19, 2018, and again at this hearing.  The Tenant
OGI who did appear at this hearing has no idea as to why his roommate did not
attend either hearings.  As such, I have no evidence before me to assess
whether the Tenant CEM was not reasonably able to participate in the
proceeding.
3.     
The Tenant OGI who attended
this hearing, stated he works as an Uber driver, and on the day of the hearing
on July 19, 2018, he was stuck in a traffic jam for an hour and as a result,
did not get to the hearing room until 11:30 AM.
4.     
I note the Board’s decision from
July 25, 2018 states that the matter was heard at 10:55 AM on July 19, 2018,
and that one of the Tenants appeared in the room at 11:50 AM asking the matter
to be heard, by which time the matter had been decided and the Landlord’s
representative had left and could not be located.
5.     
Neither Tenant’s signature
appears on the Hearing Attendance Sheet. Only the Landlord’s representative was
present in the hearing room when the matter was heard at 10:55 AM.  The
evidence before me is that only one of the Tenants appeared at the hearing room
at 11:50 AM after the hearing was completed.
6.     
The Tenant has brought no
objective evidence of a major traffic jam on the date in question.  The hearing
was scheduled for 9:30 AM, and the matter only proceeded at 10:55 AM.  Even
accounting for a one hour delay due to traffic jam, the Tenant should have been
in the hearing room by then. I do not find the explanation for his late arrival
credible or reasonable.
7.     
Overall, I am not satisfied
with the explanation for why the Tenants were not present at the hearing. I
therefore do not find that they were not reasonably able to participate in the
proceeding.  
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The request to review order
TSL-95667-18 issued on July 25, 2018 is denied. The order is confirmed and
remains unchanged.
2.     
The interim order issued on
July 26, 2018 is cancelled. The stay of eviction on the order TSL-95667-18 is
lifted.
