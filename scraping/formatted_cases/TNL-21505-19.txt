Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-21505-19
 











 
 
 

CH (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict MMV (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on January 23,
2020.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from June 1, 2019 to
January 31, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination.
 
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,200.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by
the Landlord.
 
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 1, 2019 to January 31, 2020.
 
4.      The rental unit is an apartment in a house with
two rental units.  The Tenant moved into the rental unit in July, 2018, with
his spouse and step daughter.
 
5.      The Tenant disputes the validity of the N4
Notice of Termination, because it states that only he is the Tenant.  He said
that his spouse and step daughter are also Tenants.
 
6.      The Landlord testified that there is no written
lease, and the agreement between the parties is verbal.  She said that the
tenancy agreement is with the Tenant only.
 
7.      I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the
Landlord’s testimony is credible.  The Tenant is the sole Tenant, and his
spouse and step daughter were occupants of the rental unit.  Consequently, the
N4 Notice of Termination is valid.
 
8.     
The Tenant is seeking a
payment plan.  He proposes to pay $400.00 per month towards the arrears, in
addition to paying the full rent, going forward.
 
9.     
The Tenant said that he
receives social assistance of about $733.00 per month, as well as about $300.00
per month from odd jobs that he performs.  He said that his step daughter has
moved out of the rental unit, and he also said that his spouse receives social
assistance.
 
10.  
The Tenant said that he
normally pays the rent by e-transfer, but he was unable to pay the rent in the
last few months because the phone was not connected.  He said that he has not
looked for an alternative place to live because it is too difficult to find a
suitable place.
 
11.  
The Landlord is seeking a
standard termination order. She said that she was compassionate to the Tenant,
even though he has never paid the full amount of rent that is owed.
 
12.  
The Landlord’s record of the
Tenant’s payment show that he has not paid any rent at all since October,
2019.  The Tenant owes a substantial amount of arrears, and he has not provided
evidence to show that he is able to pay the full rent, on time, going forward. 
The Tenant’s income is insufficient to pay the full rent, and he does not have
evidence of anything at all that would prove, on a balance of probabilities,
that he could pay $400.00 towards the arrears each month.
 
13.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find, based on the above reasons, that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1)
of the Act.  The arrears are very substantial, and consequently, I find that it
is severely prejudicial to the Landlord to continue the tenancy.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before March 9,
2020.
 
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $8,152.42*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to February 27, 2020, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes
on the rent deposit.
 
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $39.45 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
February 28, 2020 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March 9, 2020, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from March 10,
2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 9, 2020, then starting March 10, 2020, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 10, 2020.
 
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $9,675.00 if the payment is made on or before February 29, 2020, or
ii)       $10,875.00 if the payment is made on or before March 9, 2020**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March 10, 2020 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
