Order under Section 35
& 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-87379-18
 











 
 
 

J. R. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict S. O. and K. O. (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe. L1 application
 
The Landlord applied for an order determining whether
the Tenants altered the locking system without the Landlord's consent. L8
application
 
The Landlord applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict the Tenants because the Tenants or someone visiting or living
with them has wilfully or negligently damaged the rental unit or the
residential complex. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date. L2 application.
 
This combined application was heard in Toronto on
January 24, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant Shawn
O’Donnell attended the hearing.
 
It is determined that:
 
            L1 application
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
$4,044.12 of the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period
from November 1, 2017 to January 31, 2018. Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination.
2.     
The Tenants also owe the
Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
3.     
The total amount owing is
$4,234.12($4,044.12 + $190.00).
4.     
The Tenant proposed a
payment plan at the hearing which I find is reasonable and the Tenants shall be
given a chance to pay all of the rent arrears. I find the Tenant was motivated.
5.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant
relief from eviction subject to the conditions set out in this order pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
L8 application
6.     
The Tenants altered the
locking system on a door giving entry to the rental unit without the Landlord's
consent.
L2 application
7.     
The Landlord’s L2
application is based on an N5 notice.
8.     
The Landlord’s testimony is
that there is black spray paint on the walls, windows and walk way on the outer
part of the unit. The Landlord’s testimony is also that the storm door has a
dent and the side door frame is damaged.
9.     
The Landlord testified that
the Tenants promised to clean the spray paint and fix the door but they never
did.
10.  
The Landlord testified that
the Landlord has not seen the Tenant spraying the paint or damaging the door.
11.  
The Tenant’s testimony is
that the rental unit was vandalised around Halloween and someone sprayed paint
on the walls and damaged the door. The Tenant testified that the paint was not
sprayed by them and the door was not damaged by them.
12.  
The burden of proof is on
the applicant. I have considered all of the relevant evidence provided at the
hearing and find that the Landlord did not provide sufficient relevant evidence
to prove that the walls were sprayed by the Tenants or the door was damaged by
the Tenants. The Landlord at the hearing said that the Landlord never saw the
Tenants spraying the paint on the walls and damaging the door. Therefore the
Landlord’s L2 application shall be dismissed. 
It is ordered that:
 
L2 application
 
1.     
The Landlord’s L2
application shall be dismissed.
 
L8 application
 
2.     
The Tenants shall
immediately provide the Landlord with a key to the door of the rental unit. 
L1 application
 
3.     
The Tenants shall pay the
Landlord $4,234.12 as follows:
a)   
On or before February 1,
2018                       $1,000.00
b)   
On or before March 1, 2018                            $1,000.00
c)   
On or before April 1, 2018                               $1,000.00
d)   
On or before May 1, 2018                                $1,234.12                       
                              
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
the Landlord rent owing for the months of February, March, April and May 2018,
no later than the 1st day of each month.
5.     
If the Tenants fail to make
any one of the payments in accordance with this order, the outstanding balance
of any arrears of rent and costs to be paid by the Tenants to the Landlord
pursuant to paragraph 1 of this order shall become immediately due and owing
and the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenants apply to the Board pursuant
to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenants and requiring that the Tenants pay any new arrears, NSF fees and related
charges that became owing on the day after the breach.
