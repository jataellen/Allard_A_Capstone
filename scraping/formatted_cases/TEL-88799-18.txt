Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-88799-18
 










 
 

A.K.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict R.C.
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the
Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with
the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord
or another tenant. 
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate and evict the Tenant because
the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after
the termination date.
 
This
application was heard in Lindsay on March 19, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord and the Landlord’s property manager, A.H., attended
the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
THE APPLICATION FOR SUBSTANTIAL INTERFERENCE
 
1.      At
the hearing, the Landlord requested the consent of the Board to withdraw their
application for substantial interference. 
2.      In
accordance with subsection 200(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the ‘Act’), I consent to the withdrawal of the application.  
THE
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
3.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from February 1, 2018 to March 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective February 18, 2018.
4.      The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending March 31, 2018, total $960.00.
5.      The
Landlord incurred costs as a result of filing the application in the amount of
$190.00 and is entitled to reimbursement for those costs. 
6.      The
Tenant paid $420.00 after the application was filed.
THE APPLICATION FOR
PERSISTENTLY LATE PAYMENT
7.      The
Tenant has been persistently late in paying his rent. According to the
information provided by the Landlord, the Tenant has been late paying his rent
5 out of 5 times since November 2017. 
8.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). In
particular, I have considered the Landlord’s request that, if the Tenant is
able to pay the outstanding arrears and void the order for non-payment of rent,
he will be required to pay his rent on time for a 12 month period subject to
the Landlord’s right to apply for an order to terminate the tenancy in the
event of a breach. Based on the Landlord’s request, I find that it would not be
unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the conditions set out in this
order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.

It
is ordered that:
THE
APPLICATION FOR SUBSTANTIAL INTERFERENCE
1.      The
Landlord’s application is dismissed. 
THE APPLICATION FOR
NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
2.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before April 1, 2018.
3.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $609.89*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to March 21, 2018.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $29.59 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting March 22, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
5.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
6.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before April
1, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from April 2, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
7.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 1, 2018, then starting April 2,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 2, 2018.
9.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $1,150.00 if the payment is made on or before March 31, 2018, or
ii)       $2,050.00 if the payment is made on or before April 1, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
10.   The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after April 2, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
THE APPLICATION FOR
PERSISTENTLY LATE PAYMENT
11.   If
the Tenant voids the eviction order for non-payment of rent pursuant to
paragraphs 9 or 10 above then the Tenant shall pay to the Landlord new rent on
time and in full for the period commencing April 1, 2018, to March 31, 2019.  
12.   If
the Tenant fails to make any one of the payments in accordance with paragraph
11 of this order the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to the
Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenant and requiring that the Tenant pays any new arrears, NSF
fees and related charges that became owing after March 31, 2018.
