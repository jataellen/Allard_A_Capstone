Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-90922-18
 











 
 
 

C. G. and J. G. (the 'Landlords') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict M. L. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did
not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.  This is an L1 application.
 
The Landlords also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlords or another tenant.  This is an L2
application.
 
This application was heard in Whitby on June 11, 2018.
 
Only second-named Landlord attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from April 1, 2018 to
June 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of
Termination effective April 21, 2018.
2.    
The Landlords collected a
rent deposit of $1,300.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlords.
3.    
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 1, 2018 to April 21, 2018.
4.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
APPLICATION FOR SUBSTANTIAL INTERFERENCE
5.    
The Landlords served the
Tenant with a second Notice of Termination for substantial interference of
reasonable enjoyment; however, the Notice does not indicate a rental unit.
6.    
Subsection 43(1)(a) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') states a notice to terminate a tenancy must
indicate the rental unit.
7.    
This means the Landlords’
second Notice of Termination is invalid.  The first Notice of Termination
served on the Tenant had a termination date of February 11, 2018.  The
application was filed on April 26, 2018.  The Act states a notice of termination becomes void 30 days after the
termination date specified in the notice in subsection 46(1); therefore, the
application could not be amended to address the first Notice as it is void.
8.    
Given the above, the
Landlords’ L2 application must be dismissed.
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before July 3,
2018.
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlords $2,246.06*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to June 22, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords
owe on the rent deposit.
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $42.74 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
June 23, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before July 3, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from July 4,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before July 3, 2018, then starting July 4, 2018, the Landlords may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlords, on or after July 4, 2018.
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlords or to
the Board in trust:
i)       $4,090.00 if the payment is made on or before June 30, 2018, or
ii)      $5,390.00 if the payment is made on or before July 3, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after July 4, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlords.
10.  The Landlords’ L2 application is dismissed.
