Tenancies Act, 2006

Number: TSL-03289-19
 











 
 
 

X.J (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict J.K, V.K and R.C (the 'Tenants') because because he, another occupant of the rental unit or
someone he permitted in the residential complex has substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date (L2 application). 
 
X.J (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict J.K, V.K and R.C (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe (L1 application).
 
This application was heard in Toronto on
March 22, 2019.
 
The Landlord and the
Tenants attended the hearing
 
Determinations:
 
            L1 –
Rent Arrears
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the
Tenants were required to pay for the period from December 1, 2018 to March 31,
2019.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective January 15, 2019.
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit. 
3.     The monthly rent is $2067.00.
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.  
5.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit of
$2,000.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlord.
6.     Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenants for the period from October 2, 2016 to January 20, 2019.
7.     The Tenant explained the rent arrears
accumulated for several reasons:
(a)  Her husband was out of work unexpectedly last
summer and as the primary income earner they were not able to make their rent
payments
(b)  She recently gave birth to another child and now
she and her husband have 6 children between them.
 
8.     
The Landlord testified that
she has been forced to pay the mortgage on her own to maintain the property in
good standing.  
 
9.     
The Landlord lives with her
boyfriend and as a result has been able to afford to cover the mortgage
payments.
 
L2
– Substantial Interference
 
10.   The Landlord also applied for an order
terminating the tenancy because the Tenants have not paid the water bills they
were required to pay under the terms of the tenancy agreement. This has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord because she has had to make the
payments.
 
11.   The Tenant acknowledges this and indicates that
they are prepared to make the payment owed for to the landlord. As of the date
of the hearing the Tenants owe $2690.61 for the water bills.
 
12.   The parties disagree over who bore
responsibility for the fact that the Tenants had not paid their water bill. 
The Tenant testified that it was due to the fact that they did not receive the
water bill on regular basis because it was in the Landlord’s name.  
 
13.  The Landlord testified that she is unable to transfer the
water bill into the Tenant’s name because it has to be in the name of the
property owner, and therefore the bills cannot be sent directly to the Tenant. 
She has however added the male Tenant to the utility account.
14.  The Landlord is entitled to receive the full payment for
the outstanding water bill to the end of May 2019. 
Relief from
eviction
15.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction
subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection
83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. While I appreciate the Landlord is concerned by
the size of the rent arrears and is fearful that the Tenant will not be able to
pay the arrears, I am granting the Tenants’ request for a payment plan.  
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The Landlord’s application for termination of the tenancy is denied
on the condition that Tenants pay to the Landlord $12,592.00,
which represents the arrears of rent $12,402.00, and costs ($190.00)
outstanding for the period ending on May 31, 2019.
2.      The Tenant shall make the following payments to the Landlord in
respect of the monies owing under paragraph 1 of this order:

3.      The Tenant shall also pay the Landlord the rent for the months of June 1, 2019 to April
1, 2020 in full, and on the first of each
corresponding month. 
4.      If the Tenant fails to make any of the payments in accordance with
paragraphs 2 or 3, and by the dates required, then:
(a)      The Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenant, and for the payment of any new arrears of rent and NSF
charges not already ordered under paragraph 1 of this order. The Landlord must
make the application within 30 days of a breach of a condition set out in paragraphs
2 or 3 of this order. 
(b)      The balance owing under paragraph 1 of this order shall become
payable on the day following the date of default. The monies owing shall bear
interest at the post-judgment interest rate determined under subsection 207(7)
of the Act.
5.      On or before May 31, 2019 the Tenants shall pay $2690.00 for the water
bill for the period up to April 30, 2019 and shall make this payment directly
to the appropriate authority.
6.      If the Tenants do not comply with paragraph 5 above, the Landlord may
apply under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’) for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The
Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a breach of a condition
set out in paragraph 5 of this order.
