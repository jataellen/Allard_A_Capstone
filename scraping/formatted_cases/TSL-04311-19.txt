1273599
OL. o/a APM. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict ML (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes (L1 Application).
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's
rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date (L2 application).
 
Pursuant
to s. 82 of the Act the Tenant raised issues regarding repair and maintenance
of the rental unit and issues relating to tenant’s rights.
 
This
combined application was heard in Toronto on May 28, 2019.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
For the reasons set out below it is determined that:
 
1.     
The Tenant owes the Landlord $4,496.38. The tenancy
terminates unless the Tenant pays this amount by July 15, 2019.
2.     
The Landlord’s harassment of the Tenant and the
Landlord’s breach of the Tenant’s privacy rights constitute a breach of the
Landlord’s responsibilities under the Act.
3.     
The Landlord has failed to maintain the rental
unit in relation to the kitchen ceiling light fixture cover and a broken window
locking system.
 
L1
Application – Arrears
4.     
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the
Tenant was required to pay for the period from January 1, 2019 to May 31,
2019.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination (the
‘N4 notice) effective February 18, 2019.
5.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit of
$1,200.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenant for the period from April 15, 2017 to February 18, 2019.
7.     
We have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
L2
Application – Persistent Late Payment
8.     
On December 28, 2018, the Landlord served the
Tenant a Notice to Terminate at End of the Term for persistent late payment of
rent (the ‘N8 notice’) with a termination date of February 28, 2019.
9.     
The Tenant testified that he did not disagree
with the Landlord’s schedule of late payments in the N8 notice. The Tenant
testified that due to his pay schedule, he pays his monthly rent in 2 to 3
installments each month. As a result, his rent is not paid in full on the first
of each month. Therefore, we find that the Tenant has persistently paid his
rent late.
10.  
We have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(a) of the Act.

Section 82 - Tenant Issues
in Non-Payment of Rent Application
11.  
Pursuant to s. 82 of the Act, the Tenant raised
both repair and maintenance issues in the rental unit and tenant rights issues.
These issues may lead to an abatement of rent which would be set off against
any arrears of rent owing to the Landlord.
12.   The Tenant alleged that the Landlord harassed and interfered with his
rights by: (1) illegal entries; (2) withholding vital services; (3) sending offending
emails; and (4) the unauthorized use of his personal information.
13.  
The Tenant also alleged that he Landlord failed
to maintain the residential unit in a good state of repair and fit for
habitation and failed to comply with maintenance standards in relation to: (1)
mold in the bathroom fan; (2) stove exhaust; (3) kitchen light fixture cover;
(4) broken window lock; and (5) bathroom and kitchen plumbing/pipe flooding.
T2 –
Tenant Rights
Illegal
Entry
14.  
This claim arises as a result of the Landlord,
or their agents, entering the boiler room of the residential complex, without
prior notice to the Tenant. Specifically, the Tenant states that the Landlord
entered the boiler room on October 19, 2018 and on February 25, 2019. The
question before the Board is whether the Landlord was required to provide
notice of entry pursuant to s. 27 of the Act, when entering or accessing the
boiler room.
15.  
The Landlord and the Tenant dispute what areas
are contained within, and form a part of, the Tenant’s rental unit. The Tenant
stated that the boiler room is part of his rental unit. The Landlord disputes
this assertion and states that the boiler room is part of the common arears of
the complex and does not form part of the Tenant’s renal unit. Neither party
submitted the rental agreement to clarify the boundaries of the Tenant’s rental
unit.
16.  
The evidence before the Board was that the
boiler room contains the residential complex’s boiler and other equipment. It
is located between the Tenant’s rental unit and the shared laundry room and can
be accessed through locked doors at either end, leading into the Tenant’s
kitchen and on the opposite end into the shared laundry room. There are also
shelves within the boiler room that both the Landlord and the Tenant store
their property on. The Tenant testified that as his kitchen door provides entry
into the boiler room it must constitute part of his unit. The Landlord
testified that he maintains access to the boiler room as this is necessary for
maintenance and repair issues for the boiler/equipment. Having considered the
evidence of the parties we find the evidence of the Landlord to be more
reasonable as the boiler room contains equipment that would require access by
the Landlord on a regular basis.
17.  
We are satisfied that the boiler room does not
form part of the Tenant’s rental unit for their exclusive use and is in fact a
common area of the residential complex. The Landlord’s entry into the boiler
room therefore does not constitute illegal entry into the Tenant’s rental unit.
This claim is dismissed.
Withholding
of Vital Services 
18.  
Pursuant to s. 21 of the Act, a Landlord is
prohibited from withholding or deliberately interfering with the supply of
vital services that it is obligated to supply under the tenancy agreement.
Subsection 2(1) of the Act provides the definition of vital services, which
includes the provision of heat to a rental unit between the months of September
1 to June 15 (section 4 of O.Reg. 516/06). The Tenant gave evidence that he had
concerns regarding the temperature regulation in his unit, however, the
complaint arose as a result of the rental unit being too hot. The Tenant did
not provide evidence that his tenancy agreement contracted for the provision of
air conditioning for his unit. As there are no provisions under the Act that
require the Landlord to maintain the residential unit below a certain
temperature or a provision requiring air conditioning, this claim is dismissed.

 
Harassment
and Substantial Interference with Reasonable Enjoyment
19.  
In the hearing, the Tenant stated that the
Landlord harassed and interfered with the Tenant by sending offending emails
and improperly disclosing his personal information. Section 23 of the Act
states that the Landlord shall not harass, obstruct, coerce, threaten or
interfere with a tenant. There is no definition of “harassment” in the Act,
however prior Board decisions have defined it as follows: “harassment is
usually considered to be a course of conduct that a reasonable person knows or
ought to know would be unwelcome” (TST-62367-15).
Offending
Emails
20.  
The Tenant submitted several emails from the
Landlord into evidence that the Tenant submitted were harassing and offending.
The Landlord confirmed in the hearing that he had sent the emails and had done
so out of frustration that the rent had not been paid. 
The Landlord sent the following emails to the
Tenant:  
                            
i.         
January 29, 2019 stating, “You really need to
get a job”.  
                           
ii.         
February 8, 2019, calling the Tenant a thief. 
                          
iii.         
March 22, 2019, stating “I knew you were a
criminal from the moment you cut those bushes and lied about it…” 
                          
iv.         
April 3, 2019, stating “All of Canada is ashamed
of your behavior”.
                           
v.         
May 4, 2019, stating “6 months now $7,200. You
low life crook!!!”
                          
vi.         
May 18, 2019, stating “… You’re a nasty person”
21.  
The Tenant advised that he was upset by the tone
and content of the emails, and that they were very disrespectful and hurtful.
He advised that the allegations were untrue and offending as he was not a
thief, a criminal nor a crook.
22.  
The Tenant requested a rent abatement as a
result of the alleged harassment by the Landlord and that the Board order the
Landlord stop the harassing behavior.
23.  
We find that the average and reasonable person
would consider the comments made in the Landlord’s emails to be offending,
demeaning and inappropriate and we accept the Tenant’s evidence that they had a
negative impact on him. We are therefore satisfied that the Landlord breached
s. 23 of the Act through these emails and that they amount to harassment of the
Tenant.
Use
of Personal Information
24.  
The Tenant stated that the Landlord had recently
contacted the individuals who the Tenant had used as references in his original
tenancy application with the Landlord in 2017. The Tenant advised that on April
3, 2019, his references were contacted by the Landlord and they were informed
that the Tenant was in arrears of rent and the amount of arrears owing. The
Landlord confirmed that he had contacted the Tenant’s references as he felt
that as references, they should assist him in convincing the Tenant to pay the
rent owing.
25.  
The Landlord should not have disclosed
information about the Tenant’s rental account to third parties. The Tenant’s
payment history was personal information and pursuant to subsection 5(3) of the
Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, SC 2000,
c. 5, should only be disclosed for purposes that a reasonable person would
consider appropriate in the circumstances. 
26.  
The Landlord breached the Tenant’s privacy
rights by sharing information about his payment history with third parties and
he ought to have known that this was unreasonable as the Tenant’s references
would not have a right to know of the Tenant’s debts or credit history. We find
that the privacy breach interfered with the Tenant’s reasonable enjoyment.
Conclusion
and Remedy
27.  
The Tenant is entitled to an abatement of rent
for the harassment and also for substantial interference. Based on the nature
of these problems and the impact on the Tenant, we find that an appropriate
amount for the harassing emails would be $250.00 and an appropriate amount for
the substantial interference would be $500.00.
Repair and Maintenance Claims
28.   The Tenant alleged that the Landlord failed to conduct repairs in a
timely manner and failed to maintain the unit in relation to: (1) mold in the bathroom
fan; (2) stove exhaust vent; (3) kitchen light fixture cover; (4) broken window
lock; and (5) bathroom and kitchen plumbing/pipe flooding.
29.  
Pursuant to section 20(1) of the Act a “landlord
is responsible for providing and maintaining a residential complex, including
the rental units in it, in a good state of repair and fit for habitation and
for complying with health, safety, housing and maintenance standards.”
Bathroom fan
mold. 
30.  
The Tenant alleged that there was black mold in
the bathroom fan fixture and submitted photographs at the hearing in support of
this claim. The photographs were unclear and did not show evidence of mold. The
Landlord contested this claim and advised that he had attended the unit to
inspect the fixture and there was no evidence of mold. Based on the photographs
provided, we did not see any discoloration of any sort in the fan or evidence
of mold and we find that the Tenant was unable to prove his claim for mold on
the balance of probabilities. This claim is dismissed.
Stove
exhaust vent. 
31.  
The Tenant alleged that there was an issue with
the stove exhaust vent being open to the exterior of the unit, such that a baby
bird was able to enter into his unit. The Tenant could not explain where, or
if, there was an actual opening in the exhaust vent, but only that there would
have been no other way for a bird to enter into his unit. The Landlord
testified that there was a screen over the exhaust vent and as a result it
would be impossible for a bird to enter through the venting system and into the
unit. When asked if there was a screen over the exhaust vent, the Tenant
advised that he did not know, that it could be possible. As the Tenant is
uncertain how the bird entered his unit and whether or not the exhaust vent is
secured, we find that he was unable to prove his claim on a balance of
probabilities and this claim is therefore dismissed.
Kitchen
light fixture cover. 
32.  
The Tenant alleged that the ceiling light
fixture in the kitchen had a missing light fixture cover. He advised that the
cover was not in place as it was broken and he had advised the Landlord and had
asked for it to be repaired. The Landlord testified that he was aware that the
light fixture cover was broken and had not repaired or replaced it. Based on
the evidence before the Board, we find that the light fixture cover is broken.
The Landlord will be ordered to replace the light fixture cover.
Broken
window lock. 
33.  
The Tenant alleged that the unit’s window lock
is either broken or is incapable of securing the window. The Tenant and the
Landlord both agreed that in order to “better” secure the window, a piece of
wood has been installed to hold the window shut. The Tenant advised that the
insertion of the wood has not fully secured the window. Based on the evidence
before the Board we are not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the
window locking system is sufficient to secure the window. The Landlord will be
ordered to install a window locking system that is sufficient to secure the
window and if that is not possible with the current window system, the Landlord
will be ordered to provide a secure window.
Bathroom and
kitchen plumbing/pipes flooding. 
34.  
The Tenant alleged that there was a “pin hole”
leak in the plumbing fixtures that run from the kitchen to the washroom. This
leak caused water to flow within the ceiling and down a wall. The Tenant
provided photographs that showed the leakage caused damage to paint on one wall
and this leak was the cause of the damage to the light fixture cover in
paragraph 34. The Landlord acknowledges that there was a leak that caused the
issues listed above. The Landlord advised that he attended the unit and
repaired the leak issues, with only the paint and light fixture as outstanding
repair issues. Based on the information before the Board we find on a balance
of probabilities that the leak caused a small area of paint to peel and that
this took several months for the Landlord to repair. However, having viewed
photographs of the affected area, we cannot find that this issue was of a
sufficiently serious nature to warrant a remedy.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
            L1 Application – Arrears
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out
below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The
Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before July 15, 2019.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4,496.38*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to June 14, 2019,
less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit. The
amount of $750.00 payable by the Landlord to the Tenant pursuant to paragraph
12 of this order below, is set off against the arrears of rent, leaving a net
balance payable by the Tenant to the Landlord of $4,496.38
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $39.45
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting June 15, 2019 to the
date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before July 15, 2019, the Tenant will start to owe
interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from July 16, 2019 at 3.00%
annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated on or before July 15,
2019, then starting July 16, 2019, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord, on or after July 16, 2019.
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void this order and
continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in
trust:
i)        $6,640.00 if the payment is made on or before June 30, 2019, or
ii)       $7,840.00 if the payment is made on or before July 15, 2019**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after July 16, 2019 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make
this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
 
L2
Application – Persistent Late Payment
10.  
If the Tenant voids the L1 application above,
the Tenant shall also pay the Landlord monthly rent owing on or before the
first day of each month commencing July 1, 2018 and continuing thereafter until
and including June 1, 2020.
11.  
If the Tenant fails to make any of the payments
in paragraph 10, above, the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Act,
within 30 days of the breach and without notice to the Tenant, for an order
terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant.
Tenant’s
s. 82 Claims
12.   We grant an abatement of rent for harassment and substantial
interference in the amount of $750.00. It is appropriate that the amount owing by
the Landlord for the abatement of rent should be set off against the arrears of
rent that the Tenant owes.
13.  
The Landlord must refrain from harassing the Tenant
including but not limited to: sending offending emails to him and improperly
disclosing his personal information
14.   The Landlord is ordered to do the following repairs within 30 days
of the date of this order:
a.    Replace the ceiling light fixture in the kitchen;
b.    Repair or replace the window locking system to ensure security of
the window.
15.   If the Landlord does not complete the repairs as outlined in
paragraph 14, by July 15, 2019, the Tenant is authorized to arrange for the
repairs and may recover the cost of the repairs by deducting the amount from
the rent paid in the month after the repairs are completed.
