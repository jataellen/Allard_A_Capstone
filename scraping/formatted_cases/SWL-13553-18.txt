Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-13553-18
 
DL
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict AC and
DS (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that they owe.  The
Landlord also claimed administration charges related to NSF cheques (L1
application).  
 
In the application, the Landlord was listed as “DL C/o
RMP”.  Mailing instructions such as “c/o”, do not form part of a legal name,
and as such should not be included in Board orders.  Therefore, the style of
cause has been amended to remove “c/o RMP”.
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenants because the Tenants have persistently failed
to pay the rent on the date it was due.  The Landlord also claimed compensation
for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date (L2
application).
 
This application was heard in [CITY] on April 24,
2018.  The Landlord’s Legal Representative, IM, attended the hearing.  As of 10:54
a.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board. 
 
Determinations:
            L1 application – Arrears of Rent 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent they were required to pay for the period from November 1, 2017
to April 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective February 5, 2018.
2.     
The Landlord incurred
charges of $200.00 for administration charges related to cheques tendered by or
on behalf of the Tenants, which were returned NSF.
3.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,150.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
4.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2018 to February 5,
2018.
5.     
The Tenants paid $700.00
after the application was filed.
            L2 application – Persistent Late Rent Payment
1.     
The Tenants moved into the
rental unit in November 2016.  At this time, the tenancy is month-to-month and
rent is due on the first of the month.
2.     
The Tenants have persistently
failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.  The Tenants paid the rent late
11 times in the past 12 months.  The rent payments have ranged from 9 days late
to over a month late.
3.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,150.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
4.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2018 to February 5, 2018.
5.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before May 12,
2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $4,591.92*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to May 1, 2018 and the total charges related to NSF cheques tendered to the
Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenants, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $41.07 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting May 2, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May 12, 2018, the Tenants will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from May 13,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before May 12, 2018, then starting May 13, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 13, 2018.
