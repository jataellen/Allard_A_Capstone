C.P.A.L. c/o R.M.P. (the 'Landlord') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict C.B. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes and because the Tenant has been
persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination
date.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on May 14, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord’s
representative, A.T., attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
THE APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF
RENT
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from February 1, 2018
to May 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective February 22, 2018.
2.     
The outstanding arrears
owing for the period ending May 31, 2018, total $4,982.52. 
3.     
The Landlord paid $190.00
for the costs of filing the application and the Landlord is entitled to be
reimbursed for those costs. 
4.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,295.30 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2018 to February 22, 2018,
in the amount of $3.39.
 
THE
APPLICATION FOR PERSISTENTLY LATE PAYMENT
6.     
The Tenant has been
persistently late in paying their rent. According to the information provided
by the Landlord’s representative, the Tenant has been paid paying their rent 14
times out of 14 since April 2017. 
7.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
THE APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before May 27,
2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $3,260.37*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to May 16, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $43.42 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
May 17, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May 27, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from May 28,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before May 27, 2018, then starting May 28, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 28, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before May 27,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $5,172.52** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after May 28, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
THE
APPLICATION FOR PERSISTENTLY LATE PAYMENT
10.  
If the Tenant voids the
order for eviction with respect to non-payment of rent pursuant to paragraphs 8
or 9 above, then:
1)   
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenants is terminated as of May 31, 2018. The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before May 31, 2018; 
2)   
The Landlord shall apply the
Tenant’s last month’s rent deposit to the rent due for the month of May, 2018;
3)   
If the unit is not vacated
on or before May 31, 2018, then starting June 1, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced;
4)   
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after June 1, 2018; and
5)   
If the Tenants do not move
out of the rental unit on or before May 31, 2018, then the Tenants shall also
pay to the Landlord $43.42 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting June 1, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
