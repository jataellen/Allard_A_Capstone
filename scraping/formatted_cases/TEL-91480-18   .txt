Review Order
 
H.U. and N.U. (the 'Landlords') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict J.B-C. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did
not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.  This is an L1 application.
 
H.U. and N.U. (the 'Landlords') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict J.B-C. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant,
another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the
residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlords or another tenant; and
because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent. The
Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the
unit after the termination date.  This is an L2 application.
 
This application was resolved by order TEL-91480-18
issued on June 20, 2018
 
On July 4, 2018, the Tenant requested
a review of the order and that the order be stayed until the request to review
the order is resolved.
 
On July 5, 2018 interim order
TEL-91480-18-RV-IN was issued, staying the order issued on June 20, 2018.
 
The request was heard in Toronto
on July 13, 2018 and August 20, 2018.
 
On July 13, 2018, only the
Landlords’ representative, S.A., was in attendance when the hearing was held at
10:06 a.m.  The Tenant arrived late claiming he was having issues due to his
mental health.  I made the decision to reconvene the hearing at a later date.
 
On August 20, 2018 the Landlords’
representatives, M.R. and S.A., and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
This request for review
relies on s. 209(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act');
the Tenant says she was not reasonably able to participate in the hearing. 
2.    
This application came before
the Board on June 11, 2018.  The Tenant stated that he was unable to attend
because the Landlords had kept him up the night before texting him and he had a
bipolar episode.  After his episodes his body ‘crashes’ and this is why he was
unable to attend the hearing.  
3.    
At the time he filed his
request for review the Board issued interim order TEL-91480-18-RV-IN,
issued July 5, 2018, requiring the Tenant to file
with the Board and give the Landlord “medical documentation confirming the
statements made in the review request concerning the Tenant’s medical
condition”.
4.    
The Tenant admittedly failed
to comply with the interim order, but said it was because he had trouble
understanding the order.  I find it difficult to believe the Tenant could not
seek out another person to read the order to him if that is what he required. 
Also, the Tenant was at the Board on July 13, 2018 and he made no attempt to
speak with Tenant Duty Counsel for assistance.  According to the Tenant, he
also has supports in his life to help with his mental illness.  
5.    
Given the number of
opportunities the Tenant had to speak with someone regarding the interim order
or his case in general, and his lack of documentation to support his position,  I
am not satisfied that there is a serious error in the order or that a serious
error occurred in the proceedings.
6.    
As a result, the request for
review is denied.
7.    
During the proceedings the
Landlord’s representative expressed issue with the way the hearing was
conducted.  
8.    
Firstly, it is obvious the
Landlords were disagreeable to the hearing being reconvened after the Tenant
did not show when the hearing was called at 10:06 a.m. on July 13, 2018.  
9.    
The Statutory Powers Procedure Act (the ‘SPPA’) applies to all proceedings before the Board
(see section 184 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')).  Section 21 says,
A
hearing may be adjourned from time to time by a tribunal of its own motion or
where it is shown to the satisfaction of the tribunal that the adjournment is
required to permit an adequate hearing to be held.  
10.  In this case, when the Tenant attended the
hearing on July 13, 2018 I found the most appropriate course of action was to
reconvene the hearing and chose the quickest date to hearing, which was August
20, 2018.
11.  Secondly, the Landlord’s representative
expressed dismay at the way the hearing was held in that I reserved my decision
regarding the review and proceeded to hear the merits of the application as if
I had granted the review.  As I stated at the hearing, the reason for allowing
this to happen was to ensure the parties did not have to attend the Board again
if I granted the request for review.  
12.  The hearing was held and during submissions the
Landlord’s representative stated that had he known the merits were to be heard
at this hearing he would have requested an adjournment.  It was evident the
Landlords expected the review to be dismissed outright and were not ready to
proceed if it was determined at the hearing that the review be granted and
heard de novo.
13.  Section 183 of the Act states,
The
Board shall adopt the most expeditious method of determining the questions
arising in a proceeding that affords to all persons directly affected by the
proceeding an adequate opportunity to know the issues and be heard on the
matter.
14.  This hearing was conducted to ensure the process
was expeditious based on the request and application before the Board.
15.  Lastly, the Landlords request costs in the
amount of $400.00 because the Tenant attempted to deliberately delay the
process and wasted the Board’s, and the Landlord’s, time.  For the reasons
stated below that request is granted.
16.  
The Board’s Interpretation
Guideline 3 on Costs says a Member has the discretion to require a party to
pay, as costs, representation or preparation expenses where the conduct of that
party was unreasonable. The Interpretation Guideline states in part:
Conduct is unreasonable if it causes undue expense or delay
and includes the following:
2.Initiating an application or any procedure in bad faith;
…
7.Asking for adjournments or delays without justification;
8.Failing to prepare adequately for the hearing…
 
17.  
Although the Interpretation
Guideline is not binding on a Member I see no reason not to follow it in this
instance. 
18.  The Tenant was clearly put on notice in TEL-91480-18-RV-IN that failing to comply with the interim order by
filing his medical documentation may order the Tenant to pay costs.  When this
was put to the Tenant he asked for more time to obtain the documentation he was
ordered to file.  This request was denied.
19.  The Tenant’s failure to comply with the interim
order in tandem with his lack of evidence before the Board at the time of the
hearing on August 20, 2018 in support of his request for review, I find he
failed to prepare for the hearing and asked for an adjournment without
justification.
20.  
Given all of the above, this
is an appropriate instance for the ordering of costs to the Landlord. 
21.  This order contains all of the reasons for the
decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The request to review order
TEL-91480-18 issued on June 20, 2018, is denied. The order is confirmed and
remains unchanged.
2.    
The interim order issued on July
5, 2018, is cancelled. The stay of order TEL-91480-18 is lifted.
3.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $400.00 in costs.
4.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing on or before September 29, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
September 30, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
