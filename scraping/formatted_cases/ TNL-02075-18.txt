            Order
under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-02075-18



 


 


 



 
 
JZ
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict VB
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the
Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage; and because the
Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in
the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another
tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
 
This
application was heard in Newmarket on March 28, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from January 1, 2018 to March 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination.
 
2.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $950.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
3.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from February 1, 2015
to April 3, 2018.
 
 
4.      The
Tenant or an occupant of the rental unit or a person permitted in the
residential complex by the Tenant has
wilfully or  negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit 
by permitting a dog to urinate on the floor, walls and doors of the rental
unit.
This has
caused a strong odour to permeate the rental unit and the residential complex.
 
5.      The
Landlord has incurred and will incur costs of $1,638.50 including HST to repair
the damage.
 
6.      The
Tenant or an occupant of the Tenant's rental unit or a person permitted in the
residential complex by the Tenant  has interfered
with the Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex and the
Landlord’s rights by storing goods and scattering debris in the laundry room,
common areas and stairwells of the basement, outside the Tenant’s rental unit.
 
7.      The
Tenant did not correct the problem within the time period set out in the Notice
of Termination.
 
8.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before April 14, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $285.36*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to April 3, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $32.88 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting April 4, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,638.50, which represents the reasonable
costs of repairing the damage caused by the Tenant..
 
5.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
6.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before April
14, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from April 15, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
7.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 14, 2018, then starting April 15,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 15, 2018.
 
April 3, 2018                                                                     _______________________
