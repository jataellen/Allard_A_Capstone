F.P.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict B.M.
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on February 14, 2018. Only the Landlord’s
Agent, D.L. attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent he was required to pay for the period from
December 1, 2017 to February 28, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective December 27, 2017.
2.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,246.62 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
3.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2017
to December 27, 2017.
4.      The
Tenant paid $2,720.00 after the application was filed.
5.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before March 4, 2018.
2.      As
of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation
the Landlord is entitled to by $527.51*.
3.      However,
the Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the
Landlord owes the Tenant:
$41.90 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 22,
2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit, and
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
4.      The
Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as
a result of this order.
5.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before March 4, 2018, then starting March 5,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
6.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 5, 2018.
7.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, he must pay to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $1,273.46 if the payment is made on or before February 28, 2018, or
ii)       $2,548.01 if the payment is made on or before March 4, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after March 5, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
