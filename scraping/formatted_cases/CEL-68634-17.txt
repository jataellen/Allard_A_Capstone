Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006

W M I (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict J B (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did
not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (L1 Application).
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because she has been persistently
late in paying her rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date (L2 Application).
 
This application was heard in Mississauga
on August 22, 2017.
 
The Landlord's Agent,
E. M and the Tenant’s Agent, A. O attended the hearing.
 
Determinations and
Reasons:
 
Regarding L1 rent
owing application 
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent she was required to pay for the period from June 1, 2017 to August
31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective June 7, 2017.
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,555.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from November 1, 2011 to June 7, 2017.
4.     
The Tenant paid $3,393.00
after the application was filed.
5.     
The Tenant's Agent does not
dispute the amount of rent owing.
Regarding L2 persistent late rent application
6.     
On July 24, 2017 the
Landlord served the Tenant with an N8 notice of termination pursuant to
subsection 58(1)(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2006 (the 'Act'). 
The notice is effective September 30, 2017 and alleges that the Tenant
persistently paid rent late.
7.     
The Tenant's Agent does not
dispute that rent is due on the 1st day of each month.
8.     
The Tenant has persistently
failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.  
9.     
Rent is due on the first day
of each month. The Tenant paid rent late 12 times out of the last 12 months. The
Landlord's Agent submitted a copy of the Tenant’s rent ledger which indicates
the rent payments were made on the dates set out in the N8 notice.
Relief from
eviction
10.   The Landlord is seeking termination of the
tenancy.  The Landlord's Agent testified that this is the 9th
application at the Board and the second persistent late rent application.  The
latest termination date sought by the Landlord is October 15, 2017.
11.   The Tenant's Agent said he could pay the amount
of rent owing by August 25th, 2017 and agreed that rent is due on
the first day of each month.  He said that he is juggling bills because he
lives with 4 children and a barrier to paying rent on time is due to tuition
payments for his child who is completing their last semester. He requests three
months if the tenancy is terminated.
12.   I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it
would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the conditions
set out in this order pursuant to subsections 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. The Landlord's
Agent did not provide sufficient details regarding prior applications such as
whether the Tenant complied with any relief provided. This is a longer term
tenancy, six years in length.  To balance any prejudice to the Landlord, the
Tenant is required to void the rent arrears portion of the order to benefit
from a condition to pay the rent on time with a section 78 provision where the
Landlord can file for eviction if a payment of rent is late without notice to
the Tenant. 
It is ordered that:
 
L1 rent owing
application:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before September
10, 2017.
2.     
As of the date of this
order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the Landlord is
entitled to by $23.57*.
3.     
However, the Landlord is
authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the Landlord owes
the Tenant: $56.41 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
August 31, 2017 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit, and $190.00 for
the cost of filing the application.
4.     
The Landlord or the Tenant
shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
5.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before September 10, 2017, then starting September 11, 2017, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
6.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after September 11, 2017.
7.     
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, she must pay to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust:
i)        $1,904.95 if the payment is made on or before August 31, 2017, or
ii)       $3,620.64 if the payment is made on or before September 10, 2017**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after September 11, 2017
but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
L2 persistent late rent application:
9.     
If the Tenant pays the
amount required to void the rent arrears portion of this order, then the
tenancy will continue subject to the following condition:
10.   The Tenant shall pay the Landlord the full monthly rent on or before
the first day of each month for a twelve month period commencing October 1,
2017 through to and including September 1, 2018.
11.   If the Tenant fails to make any one of the payments
ordered in paragraph 10, in full and on time, the Landlord may apply under
section 78 of the Act, without notice to the Tenant for an order terminating
the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord must make this application no
later than 30 days after the Tenant’s failure to make a payment.
