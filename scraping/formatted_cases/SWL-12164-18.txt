Order
under Section 87(1)
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: SWL-12164-18
[Number
Company] (the 'Landlord') applied for an order requiring KM (the 'Tenant') to
pay the rent that the Tenant owes. (L1)
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy because the Landlord has entered into an agreement of purchase and
sale with a purchaser who intends to occupy the premises for residential use
for at least one year. (L2)
 
This application was heard in Windsor on
March 29, 2018.
 
AA, the Landlord’s Agent, attended the
hearing.  The Tenant attended the hearing and spoke with Duty Counsel prior to
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
Application to Evict
a Tenant for Non-payment of Rent and to Collect the Rent the Tenant Owes (L1)
 
1.     
 The Tenant was in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
2.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from January 1, 2013
to March 31, 2018.
 
3.      The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
 
4.      The monthly rent is $765.00.
 
5.      The parties agree that if the Tenant can find a receipt for the last
month's rent deposit, the Landlord will credit the Tenant with that amount.
 
6.      The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed. 
7.     
The Tenant agreed that she
did not pay the rent for January, February and March 2018, and that she owes
$2,295.00 for that period. 
 
8.     
The Tenant said that during
the months of July and August 2016, she paid her rent to JM because he came to
the premises and showed her a legal document that convinced her that he was the
legal owner and he promised her that if she paid him the rent, he would
re-invest the funds in the house.  
 
9.     
The Landlord argued that the
Tenant had no legal right to pay the funds to JM because he was the owner from
whom the Landlord had purchased the property in a power of sale proceeding and
although he retained the equity of redemption it was the numbered company from
whom the Tenant rented the premises that was entitled to the rent.  She
produced a Notice to Attorn dated August 10, 2016, instructing the Tenant to
pay the rent to the [numbered company].
 
10.   The Notice to End a Tenancy Early for
Non-payment of Rent (N4) stipulates that the monthly rent is $765.00 and that
the Tenant paid $15.00 only in each of July and August 2016, and gives the
Tenant until May 10, 2017, to void the notice by paying $1500.00.  The
testimony of both the Landlord and the Tenant was that the Tenant had paid the
rent for those two months to JM. The Landlord did not produce any evidence to
support the accuracy of the Notice to End a Tenancy Early for Non-payment of
Rent (N4) which says the Tenant paid $15.00 in each of July and August 2016, in
contradiction of the testimony of both parties that the Tenant had paid the
full rent for those months to JM.  I would have dismissed the N4 for that
reason but the Landlord withdrew the claim for the arrears for July and August
2016, during the hearing, without prejudice to her right to claim it from the
Tenant in the future.
 
11.   The Application to Evict a Tenant for
Non-payment of Rent and to Collect the Rent the Tenant Owes (L1) is therefore
converted to an Application to Collect Rent the Tenant owes (L9) for arrears
only.
 
Application to Terminate a Tenancy and Evict a Tenant (L2)
12.   The Landlord served the Tenant with a Notice to
Terminate at End of the Term for Landlord’s or Purchaser’s Own Use (N12) with a
termination date of February 28, 2018.  The Landlord testified that she and her
partner are retiring and ceasing to be Landlords so they have sold most of
their rental properties.  She said that they have agreed to sell this property
to their son because it is a convenient location for him to live in while
completing his university studies.  The Landlord filed an update affidavit in
which the son attested to his intention to live in the rental property for at
least one year.
 
13.   The Tenant said that she had attempted to secure
alternate accommodation but believed the Landlord was giving her a bad
reference.  She then entered into an agreement with the Landlord to rent
another unit from the Landlord but that fell through when she attempted to move
in and found someone already living in the unit.
 
14.   I am satisfied that the Landlord has entered
into an agreement of purchase and sale with her son and that he in good faith
intends to live in the premises for at least one year.
 
15.   The Tenant requested an extension of time to
move.  The parties attempted to negotiate a payment schedule by which the
Tenant would pay the arrears she admits to owing and vacate by May 31, 2018. 
However, they failed to reach a resolution with respect to the dates of payments.
 
16.   I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
delay the eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. 
 
It is ordered that:
                                          
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before May 31, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $4,000.00, which represents the rent owing from January 1, 2018,  to May
31, 2018, and the cost of filing the application. 
3.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlords the full amount owing on or before May 31,
2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from June 1, 2018, at 3.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
4.     
The Landlord’s application
to evict the Tenants on an earlier date than May 31, 2018, is denied on the
condition that:
(a)  The Tenants shall make the following payments to the
Landlord in respect of the monies owing under paragraph 2 of this order:



Date Payment Due


Amount of Payment




April 20, 2018


$2,000.00
(arrears and costs) 



 
(b)  The Tenant shall also pay the Landlord the rent
for the month May 2018, in full, on or before the first day of May 2018.
5.      If the Tenants fail to make the payments in
accordance with paragraph 4, and by the dates required, then:
(a)  The Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenants on an earlier date than May 31, 2018, and for the
payment of any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not already ordered under
paragraph 2 of this order. The Landlord must make the
application within 30 days of a breach of a condition set out in paragraph 4 of
this order. If the Landlord obtains an order under section 78 of the Act, then
the Landlord may choose which eviction order to enforce. 
(b)  The balance owing under paragraph 2 of this
order shall become payable on the day following the date of default. The monies
owing shall bear interest at the post-judgment interest rate determined under
subsection 207(7) of the Act.
6.     
Notwithstanding paragraphs 4
and 5 of this order, if the unit is not vacated on or before May 31, 2018, then
starting June 1, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced. 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 31, 2018.
