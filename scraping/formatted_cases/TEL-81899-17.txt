Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-81899-17
 
 










 
 

O.I.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict M.L.
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Lindsay on December 5, 2017, and March 19, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s corporate owner, D.V., the Landlord’s
representative, L.W., and the Tenant attended the hearing. The Tenant’s
representative, M.P., also attended the second day of the hearing. S.C.
testified on behalf of the Landlord. 
 
Preliminary Issue:
 

By
     way of background, the residential complex is a mobile home park and the
     Tenant rents three separate units in the complex. The applications and
     issues for the three units are the same and all three applications were
     heard together. 
On
     the first day of hearing, December 5, 2017, the Tenant requested an
     adjournment so that he could seek legal counsel. The Tenant says that he
     thought he could receive assistance from Duty Counsel, but he now
     understands that is not possible. 
During
     the hearing, tenant duty counsel, SC, provided testimony regarding what
     instructions she had given to the Tenant when this matter previously came
     before the Board on September 12, 2017. SC says that she specifically
     advised the Tenant at that time that she was prohibited from representing
     him due to a conflict of interest. 
SC
     also clarified that, when the previous landlords filed for bankruptcy, she
     assembled the majority of the tenants into an association. The association
     collected rent and maintained the park while they waited for a new owner
     to purchase the property. SC says the Tenant was not part of the
     association and he did not contribute to the collection of monthly rent.
     This fact also prohibited SC from representing the Tenant at the hearing. 
SC
     says the notices of termination were served in May 2017, the application
     was filed in June 2017 and the Tenant was told in person in September 2017
     that she could not assist him. SC says the Tenant has had more than enough
     time to find legal representation. 
The
     Tenant says that he did not understand the SC could not represent him
     because he did not understand what a “conflict of interest” was. 
Based
     on the evidence before me at the hearing, I am satisfied that the Tenant
     was properly informed months prior to the hearing that SC could not
     represent him. The Tenant admits that he was told there was a “conflict of
     interest” but I find that he failed to act on that information to either
     get clarification or to seek legal representation elsewhere. 
As
     this matter had already come before the Board three months prior and as
     the Tenant had an opportunity to seek legal counsel, I denied the Tenant’s
     request for an adjournment. 

Determinations:
9.    The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from October 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective May 31, 2017.
10. The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending March 31, 2018, total $15,375.00.
11. The
Landlord incurred costs as a result of filing the application in the amount of
$175.00 and is entitled to reimbursement for those costs. 
12. There
is no dispute between the parties as to the chronology of events in this
matter. The previous landlord declared bankruptcy on January 19, 2016. The
residential complex was essentially abandoned for an entire year. During that
year, the Trustee in Bankruptcy (the ‘Trustee’) refused to collect rent from
any of the tenants on the property. Indeed, when rent cheques were sent to the
Trustee, he returned them to the appropriate tenant.  
13. The
current Landlord purchased the mobile home park in April 2017 and the Landlord
is now seeking rental arrears for all outstanding rent from the tenants, including
any rent that was owing before the previous landlord declared bankruptcy.  
14. There
is no dispute that the Tenant purchased this unit from the previous landlord in
August 2015. The application before me claims outstanding arrears beginning in
October 2015. 
15. The
Tenant and his representative make several arguments including:
•       
The new Landlord is not permitted to collect rent that was owing
before they bought the property;
•       
The Trustee should have collected rent from the tenants and any
claim for that rent now is “unjust enrichment”;
•       
The notice of termination is invalid because it claims an increase
to the monthly rent that is above the guideline; 
•       
The notice of termination is invalid because the Tenant had an
arrangement with the previous landlord in which he provided work in exchange
for rent; and
•       
The notice of termination is invalid because the Tenant had an
agreement with the previous landlord for different monthly rent amounts.   
The New
Landlord’s Rights  
16. As
I explained several times at the hearing, the new Landlord is permitted to
claim any and all outstanding rent that became due for the period before they
bought the property. 

Pursuant to section 18 of the Act, covenants “run with the land”
     which means when there is a transfer of title the new landlord
     steps into the shoes of the old landlord and they must
     accept the terms and conditions of the tenancy as they
     find them. In other words, the new Landlord must accept any debts or
     credits in the tenancy and is entitled to claim any outstanding arrears of
     rent. 
Based on the evidence before me, I find that the new
     Landlord is entitled to collect any amount of rent that may be
     outstanding, including rent arrears for the period prior to the sale of
     the property.

 The Trustee in Bankruptcy
19. The
Tenant’s representative says that the Trustee failed in his duty of care
towards the Landlord and he should have collected and retained any monthly rent
that was offered to him by any of the tenants. 
20. It
is useful to note that the Tenant’s representative led no evidence regarding
whether the Tenant actually tried to pay rent to the Trustee, but that issue is
not particularly relevant to my analysis. 
21. As
I explained at the hearing, whether or not the Trustee fulfilled his or her
duty of care to the Landlord is not a matter within my jurisdiction. If the
Landlord has concerns about how the terms of the bankruptcy were handled, they
can pursue a remedy in a court of competent jurisdiction. I have no
jurisdiction to determine whether the Trustee was required to collected and
retain the monthly rent. 
22. Based
on the evidence before me, I am satisfied that, even if the Trustee should have
collected the monthly rent, that does not change the wording of the Act which,
as stated above, requires the new Landlord to step into the shoes of the
previous landlord and collect any rent that may be outstanding. 
 
Above
Guideline Increase
23. The
Tenant’s representative says that the Landlord is claiming a rent increase that
is above the legislated guideline amount. The Tenant’s representative sites
subsection 6(2) of the Act which was repealed and which limited the “rent
control” provisions to certain properties. The Tenant’s representative says
that this mobile home park is now subject to the rent control provisions and
the Landlord was not permitted to increase the rent above the guideline. 
24. In
support of his position, the Tenant’s representative provided the Board with a
copy of an N2 notice of rent increase which says that the monthly rent for Unit
#2 will increase to $980.00 on August 1, 2017. 
25. The
difficulty with this argument is two-fold. First, the section of the Act in
question was not repealed until May 30, 2017. The Act includes “grandfathering”
provisions in subsection 120(1)(3) which outline which notices of rent increase
will be valid and which will be invalid. The notice before me is dated April
25, 2017. Neither the Tenant nor the Landlord led any evidence regarding how or
when the notice was served. However, if I assume that the notice was served on
or after April 25th, the transitional provisions of the Act say that
this notice is valid and any increase that is implemented must be reduced to
the guideline amount. This means there is nothing inherently flawed regarding
the notice of rent increase. 
26. The
second problem with the argument is that it appears the Landlord did not
actually implement the rent increase listed in the notice. I say this because
the N4 notice of termination lists the monthly rent for Unit #2 as $512.50
dating back to October 2015, and the application and two hearing update sheets
since the application all list the monthly rent for Unit #2 as $512.50. 
27. Based
on the evidence before me, I am not satisfied that the Landlord actually
increased the monthly rent or that it increased the monthly rent in a way that
was not in keeping with the requirements of the Act. 
The Work
for Rent Arrangement
28. The
Tenant says that he was “unofficially employed” by the previous landlord and
had been for 12 years. As part of this informal arrangement, the landlord would
trade portions of the monthly rent in exchange for the Tenant performing
various tasks on the property including shoveling show. 
29. The
Tenant says he offered to make a similar arrangement with the new Landlord but
they refused. 
30. When
questioned regarding the terms of his agreement, the Tenant could not provide
any documentary evidence or any other corroborating evidence to explain the
precise terms and conditions of this arrangement. The Tenant could not provide
a statement of account showing work that he had performed over the years or the
amount of rent that was deducted in exchange for that work. The Tenant could 
also not provide an exact explanation regarding what precise work he did on the
property, other than that he periodically shovelled snow. The Tenant’s
testimony regarding this issue was vague and he provided very few details. 
31. The
previous landlord did not attend the hearing to provide any testimony regarding
the nature of the alleged arrangement he had with the Tenant for the last 12
years. 
32. Based
on the evidence before me, I am not satisfied that the Tenant had a verbal
agreement with the previous landlord in which he performed work in exchange for
a deduction on his rent. 
The
Monthly Rent is Incorrect
33. The
Tenant says that the amount of arrears the Landlord is claiming is incorrect.
The Tenant says he had a written lease agreement with the previous landlords
and the amount of monthly rent they agreed to is different than the amount of
rent the new Landlord is charging. 
34. On
the first hearing day, the Tenant provided the Board with a copy of a scanned
document called a “lease agreement” (‘Document A’). This document
contains one single paragraph that describes two Commodore park model homes and
identifies them each as Unit #2 and Unit# 24. Document A says that the Tenant
was the owner of Unit #2 as of August 14, 2015, “in the amount of $348.72”.
Document A also says that the Tenant was the owner of Unit #24 as of August 27,
2015, “in the amount of $338.26”. The Tenant says the document was signed by
himself, his partner and the two previous landlords on August 27, 2015. 
35. Even
though the word “rent” is not listed anywhere in Document A, the Tenant says it
confirms that the monthly rent for Unit #2 is $348.72. The Tenant says he had a
discussion with the new Landlord and sent this “lease agreement” via email to
her on October 17, 2017, as proof that the $512.50 she was charging for Unit #2
was incorrect. 
36. On
the second day of hearing, the Tenant provided the Board with a copy of a
second document with the title “lease amount” (‘Document B’). This
document is dated and signed on August 14, 2015, and contains one single
paragraph that describes a Commodore park model home identified as Unit #2. 
However, the description of the Unit #2 model home in Document B does not match
the description in Document A. The Tenant says that this is simply a
typographical error. 
37. Also,
Document B is dated and signed on a different date than Document A, even though
the subject of both documents is the same. The Tenant had no explanation for
this discrepancy. 
38. Finally,
the monthly rent listed for Unit #2 in Document B is $338.26 while the amount
listed in Document A is $348.72. The Tenant provided no explanation for this
discrepancy. 
39. The
Tenant also had no explanation regarding why these documents, which he
purported to be “lease agreements” did not contain any other terms or
conditions regarding the tenancy arrangement. 
40. The
Tenant provided the Board with a third document which he called a “bill of
sale” (‘Document C’) for Unit #2. This document is dated August 27,
2015, identifies Unit #2 and confirms that the Tenant paid $3,000.00 for the
unit on August 27, 2015. However, Document C has a different sale date for Unit
#2 than is listed in Document A. The Tenant had no explanation for this
discrepancy. 
41. The
Landlord says that she is not aware of any agreement the Tenant had with the
previous owners, and she doubts the veracity of the documents before me. The
Landlord says that the Trustee called her and told her that the monthly rent is
$512.50 for Unit #2, $359.09 for Unit #19 and $435.79 for Unit #24. 
42. The
Landlord says she has no reason to doubt these figures because all of the
tenants in the association described above had no dispute regarding the monthly
rent figures she obtained from the Trustee. She saw no reason to view the
amounts for the Tenant any differently. 
43. The
Landlord says she gave the Tenant every opportunity to provide her with the
alleged lease agreement but the Tenant only emailed her Document B and C and a
third “bill of sale” document. The Landlord forwarded the documents to her real
estate lawyer who suggested they were not legitimate lease agreements. The
Landlord says when she tried to discuss the documents with the Tenant and ask
questions, the Tenant was evasive and would not explain the documents or answer
her concerns. 
44. At
the hearing, the Landlord showed the Board an exchange of text messages in
which she asks the Tenant to print out the “lease agreements” for the three
units because the documents are difficult to read. The Tenant tells her that he
is out of town, and then he does not respond any further.  
45. Based
on the evidence before me, I find the Tenant’s evidence on this point is not
credible. I am not satisfied that the Tenant had a lease agreement with the
previous landlords that contains a different amount of monthly rent than what
is being claimed in the applications before me. The documents the Tenant
provided at the hearing were vague, unclear and contained numerous
discrepancies. The Tenant could not provide a valid explanation for the various
errors and inconsistencies. I am satisfied that these documents are not valid
lease agreements and the monthly rent amounts the Landlord obtained through the
Trustee are accurate and valid. 
46. I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Act. In particular, I have considered that the Tenant
is living in Unit #19 and his older children live with him on a part-time
basis. The Tenant says that, due to a rental housing shortage in his area, it
will likely take him one year to either find a new place to live or to sell the
units and move. I have also considered that the Tenant has failed to make any
payments towards the rent since October 2015 and the arrears are now quite
substantial. I have also considered the fact that the Tenant furnished
documents to the Board which were, at best, misleading, and at worst,
fraudulent. As such, the Tenant comes to the Board with “unclean hands” and
disentitles himself to any discretion the Board may exercise to grant relief
from eviction. For these reasons, I find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
47. This
order contains all the reasons for the decision within it. No further reasons
shall be issued. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before April 2, 2018.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $15,733.25*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to March 22, 2018.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $16.85 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting March 23, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before April
2, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from April 3, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 2, 2018, then starting April 3,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 3, 2018.
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $15,550.00 if the payment is made on or before March 31, 2018, or
ii)       $16,062.50 if the payment is made on or before April 2, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after April 3, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
