Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-11933-19










 

J
H (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict J T
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges and related administration
charges. (L1 Application) 
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's
rent. (L2 Application)
 
This
combined L1/L2 application was heard in Toronto on February 7, 2020.
 
The
Landlord; the Landlord’s representative, A M I; and the Tenant attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 Application 
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from October 1, 2019 to February 29, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective November 21, 2019.
2.     
The Tenant did not dispute the amount the
Landlord claims he owes. Therefore, I am satisfied on a balance of
probabilities that the Tenant owes the Landlord $3,497.00, including arrears of
rent to February 29, 2020, NSF-related charges and the application filing fee. 
 
L2 Application 
 
3.     
The rent is due in the first day of the month.
The parties did not dispute that the Tenant paid his rent late in six of the
eight months between February 2019 and September 2019. Therefore, I am
satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Tenant persistently paid his
rent late.
 
Section 83 considerations
 
4.     
The Landlord requested a non-voidable
termination order pursuant to the L2 application. The Landlord asked me to
consider that throughout the tenancy, which began on December 1, 2018, the
Landlord has had to serve the Tenant with nine N4 Notices of Termination and
the Tenant has caused the Landlord to repeatedly incur NSF-related charges. The
Landlord also asked me consider that since the application was filed, the arrears
have more than doubled and the Tenant has not corrected his rent-paying conduct
even while knowing his tenancy was at stake.
 
5.     
On the other hand, the Tenant asked for another
chance to maintain his tenancy. He testified that the reason he accumulated arrears
and paid his rent late is that he was laid off twice over the past year. The
Tenant also testified that he was waiting for a lump-sum payment from EI to pay
his arrears, which he recently received. The Tenant presented this cheque at
the hearing and I am satisfied that it is sufficient to cover the arrears he
owes. The Tenant testified that he is prepared to pay his arrears immediately.
The Tenant also testified that he will be starting a new job soon and, in the
meantime, he will be receiving bi-weekly payments from EI.
 
6.     
Based on the Tenant’s testimony about his
financial situation, I find that the Tenant should be able to bring his rent
account into good standing and pay his rent on time going forward. The lump-sum
payment from EI will help him get back on his feet. I understand the Landlord’s
frustration with the Tenant’s pattern of non-payment and late payment of rent
but in the circumstances, I find it appropriate to give the Tenant another
chance to maintain the tenancy. The Landlord will also have a remedy if the
Tenant misses any payments toward his arrears or rent going forward.
Accordingly, I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to the conditions set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
L1
Application 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before March 7, 2020.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,961.81*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to February 25, 2020 and the total charges
related to 6 NSF cheques tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the
Tenant, less the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $36.79 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 26, 2020 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March
7, 2020, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from March 8, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before March 7, 2020, then starting March 8,
2020, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 8, 2020.
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)  $3,497.00 if the payment is made on or before February 29, 2020, or
ii)  $4,616.00 if the payment is made on or before March 7, 2020**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after March 8, 2020 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
L2
Application 
10.   If
the Tenant voids the L1 Application in accordance with paragraph eight above,
the tenancy shall continue on the following terms. 
11.   The
Tenant shall pay the Landlord the monthly rent due on or before the first day
of the month for the period April 1, 2020 to March 1, 2021. 
12.   If
the Tenant fails to make any of the payments in paragraph 11 above, the
Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Act, within 30 days of the breach
and without notice to the Tenant, for an order terminating the tenancy and
evicting the Tenant.
