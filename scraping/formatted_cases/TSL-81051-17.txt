Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-81051-17










 

C.P.A.I.C
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict V.P
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on July 3, 2018.
 
The
Landlord’s representative, M.Z, and the Tenant attended the hearing. The Tenant
left the hearing before it was concluded.
            
Determinations:
 
Issues
under s.82
 
1.      This
matter is related to TST-82136-17, which is an application filed by the Tenant
against the Landlord. This matter and TST-82136-17 were directed to be heard
together.
 
2.      These
matters were originally heard by a different Board member, whose appointment at
the Board abruptly ended when he was appointed elsewhere. The other Board
member had not issued an order.
 
3.      The
parties were notified that the original Board member was no longer at the Board
and they were asked if they consent to a new Board member continuing the
proceedings after listening to the hearing recordings. The Tenant consented to
this but the Landlord did not. Because both parties did not consent, by
Endorsement dated May 8, 2018 these matters was directed to be heard de novo
(anew) by a new Member. 
 
4.      At
the outset of the hearing on July 3, 2018 the Tenant objected to these matters
being heard de novo. I pointed out to her that it had already been
directed that these matters proceed de novo and so that is how I would
proceed. The Tenant continued to object to a de novo hearing. 
 
5.      Early
in the hearing the Tenant requested an adjournment because she was confused.
She did not clearly articulate what she found confusing but it may be that she
was confused about how the hearing of this matter de novo affected the
limitation period that would apply to her s.82 issues raised as part of the
Landlord’s application. 
 
6.      Later
in the hearing I asked the Tenant to give submissions on what she disagreed
with in the Landlord’s ledger. I gave her five minutes to review the ledger
before giving submissions. At that time the Tenant became very upset and she
indicated that she wished to leave the hearing and appeal whatever order
resulted from it. The Tenant indicated that there is a large volume of evidence
for this matter and that she cannot give her submissions so quickly. I pointed
out that the evidence to which she refers is relevant only to the s.82 issues
and I repeated that I would give her five minutes to review the ledger. (I note
that this is not the first time she has seen the ledger, which was provided to
her on previous hearing dates.) The Tenant then indicated that she did not
bring relevant evidence (such as her own records of payment) to the hearing. I
offered the Tenant an opportunity to consult with Tenant Duty Counsel. I told
the Tenant that I would hold the matter down for 30 minutes or a longer period
if requested. The Tenant indicated that she did not intend to consult with
Tenant Duty Counsel but she would like time to consult her lawyer. I held the
matter down for 30 minutes.
 
7.      After
the hearing resumed, the Tenant took issue with describing application TST-82136-17
as the Tenant’s application. The Tenant’s objection was disruptive and
unnecessary so I directed the Tenant not to object to small inconsequential
issues. The Tenant became very belligerent and
abruptly left the hearing room. As she was leaving I strongly recommended that
she stay and continue the proceedings and I told her that the hearing would
continue without her. 
 
8.      Notwithstanding
that I warned the Tenant that the hearing would continue without her, I held
the matter down for approximately five minutes, after which the Tenant
returned. 
 
9.      Later
in the hearing the Tenant renewed her objection to these matters being heard de
novo. Then, when I attempted to administer an oath to the Tenant before she
was to give testimony in support of her application and her s.82 issues, she
became belligerent again and refused to give the oath. Raising her voice and
speaking in an aggressive manner, she asked where the Landlord’s witnesses are
because she wished to cross-examine them. I told her that the location of the
Landlord’s witnesses is irrelevant at this stage. It was 3:30pm at the time and
we would certainly not reach the Landlord’s witnesses before we broke for the
day. The Tenant persisted in her objection based on the Landlord’s witnesses
not being present at the hearing at that time. I indicated that having the
Landlord’s witnesses available for cross-examination is not a pre-condition to
the Tenant giving testimony. The Tenant then stated that she wished to leave
the hearing. I warned her that both the Landlord’s application and the Tenant’s
application would be decided in her absence if she leaves the room. I also
warned her that these matters would not be held down further. The Tenant left
the hearing without giving any evidence.
 
10.   Since
the Tenant did not appear at the hearing to support her issues under s.82 of
the Act, application, I find that the Tenant has abandoned her issues under s.
82 of the Act.
Arrears
11.   The
Tenant has not paid the total rent she was required to pay for the period from
October 1, 2013 to October 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective January 5, 2017.
12.   The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
13.   The monthly rent as of the date of the hearing is $1,104.50. 
14.   The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,019.45 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
15.   The
Tenant paid $17,009.28 after the application was filed.
16.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before July 17, 2018.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,387.56*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to July 6, 2018, less the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $36.31 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting July 7, 2018 to the date she moves out of the unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $170.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before July
17, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from July 18, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before July 17, 2018, then starting July 18,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 18, 2018.
8.      If,
on or before July 17, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $4,937.67** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after July 18, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
