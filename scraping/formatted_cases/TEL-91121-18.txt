Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-91121-18
 











 
 
 

W.F.P. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict E.P. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on June 6, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s agent, J.X., and
the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Preliminary Issue:
 

The Tenant says that she did not receive the notice of
     termination and she was not properly served. 
The certificate of service before me confirms that one of the
     Landlord’s staff members sent the notice to the Tenant in the mail. The
     Landlord’s agent confirmed at the hearing that he personally called the
     staff member before the start of the hearing and she confirmed that she
     mailed the notice to the Tenant. 
Subsection 191(3) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
     (the 'Act') and Rule 5.4 of the Board’s Rules of Practice state that a
     notice sent in the mail is deemed to be given 5 days after mailing. Based
     on the certificate of service before me, which is a sworn legal document,
     as well as the Landlord’s agent’s testimony, I am satisfied on the balance
     of probabilities that the Landlord’s staff member properly served the
     Tenant by placing the notice of termination in the mail. 

Determinations:
4.    The Tenant has not paid the total rent he was
required to pay for the period from March 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.  Because of
the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective April 24,
2018.
5.    The outstanding arrears owing for the period
ending June 30, 2018, total $1,309.48. 
6.    The Landlord paid $190.00 for the costs of
filing the application and the Landlord is entitled to be reimbursed for those
costs. 
7.    The Landlord collected a rent deposit of
$1,140.82 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
8.    Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenant for the period from June 1, 2017 to April 24, 2018, in the amount of
$18.47.
9.    The Tenant paid $2,700.00 after the application
was filed.
10. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act'). In particular, I have considered that the Tenant has lived in the
rental unit for approximately 9 years along with her three children ages 13,
11, and 6 years old. I have also considered that, based on the Tenant’s monthly
income and expenses, the Tenant cannot afford to live in the rental unit. In
fact, the Landlord’s agent confirmed at the hearing that this is now the 16th
application for non-payment of rent that the Landlord has brought regarding
this tenancy. The Board’s records confirm the agent’s statement. 
11. The Tenant says that her mother repeatedly helps her with
her monthly expenses and her mother will help her with any money she needs this
month. The Tenant says she can pay the full amount of outstanding arrears by
June 10th when both of her social assistance cheques have arrived.
Although this leaves the Tenant with no money for any of her monthly expenses,
the Tenant is confident that her mother can help her with whatever she may
need. 
12. The Landlord says this tenancy needs to end. The Tenant
clearly cannot afford the rental unit and the Landlord should not be forced to
repeatedly come to the Board in order to chase the Tenant for the monthly rent.
I agree with the Landlord’s position. 
13. Based on the evidence before me, I find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
The Tenant cannot afford the rental unit, but she refuses to move to a more
affordable location. Instead, she relies on her mother’s help and delays paying
her rent until the Landlord is forced to file an application with the Board.
This pattern of conduct is unfair to the Landlord and the tenancy must be
terminated. 
14. For these reasons, I find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction, subject to the mandatory requirement that the Tenant pay
the arrears within 11 days in order to void the eviction order. As the standard
11 day order requested by the Landlord actually gives the Tenant more time than
she says she needs to pay the arrears, there is no reason to grant any further
relief in the form of a delay. A standard order will issue accordingly.
 
 
It is ordered that:
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before June 24,
2018.
2.     
As of the date of this
order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the Landlord is
entitled to by $542.82*.
3.     
However, the Landlord is
authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the Landlord owes
the Tenant:
$37.51 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting June 14, 2018
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit, and
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
4.     
The Landlord or the Tenant
shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
5.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 24, 2018, then starting June 25, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
6.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 25, 2018.
7.     
If, on or before June 24,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $1,499.48** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after June 25, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
