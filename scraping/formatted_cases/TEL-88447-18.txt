Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-88447-18










 
 

M.P.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict R.G.
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on March 7, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, G.P., and the Tenant attended the
hearing. 
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent he was required to pay for the period from
November 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective November 27, 2017.
2.      The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending March 31, 2018, total $4,395.94.
3.      The
Landlord incurred costs as a result of filing the application in the amount of
$190.00 and is entitled to reimbursement for those costs. 
4.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,099.17 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from December 1, 2017
to November 27, 2017, $0.14.
6.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). The
circumstances here are that the Tenant lives alone in the rental unit and has
lived there for approximately 3 years. The Tenant says he fell into arrears
because he did not work enough hours this winter at his seasonal job. The
Tenant says was ineligible to collect Employment Insurance because he did not
work enough hours to qualify. 
7.      The
Tenant says he recently started working again, but he was unable to provide the
Board with any documentary evidence to confirm his testimony. The only document
the Tenant provided to the Board was a pay stub receipt from 2017. However, the
Tenant admits that this receipt was an advance that he obtained from his
employer. The Tenant is currently making $200.00 each month from his pension
and, based on his monthly expenses, he simply cannot afford the rental unit. 
8.      The
Landlord says this is now the fourth application they have filed with the Board
since September 2015. Each of those applications was for non-payment of rent.
The Landlord is no longer able to work with the Tenant towards a payment plan
because the arrears are now quits substantial. 
9.      The
Tenant has not begun looking for another place to live and he does not know how
long it will take him to find a new place. 
10.   Based
on the evidence before me, I am not satisfied that the Tenant can afford the
monthly rent or that he can afford to pay the outstanding arrears. It appears
that the Tenant has not worked consistently for quite some time and I am not
satisfied that this pattern will change in the near future. 
11.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) and I find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It
is ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before April 3, 2018.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $3,518.59*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to March 23, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $36.14 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting March 24, 2018 to the date he moves out of the unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before April
3, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from April 4, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 3, 2018, then starting April 4,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 4, 2018.
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, he must pay to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $4,585.94 if the payment is made on or before March 31, 2018, or
ii)       $5,685.11 if the payment is made on or before April 3, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after April 4, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
