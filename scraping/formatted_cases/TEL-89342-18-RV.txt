Review
Order
 
C.L.R.I. (the 'Landlord') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict R.L. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved by order
TEL-89342-18 issued on May 1, 2018.
 
On May 11, 2018, the Tenant requested a
review of the order.
 
The request was heard in Toronto on May 25,
2018 and June 6, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s agent, A.M.-L.,
and the Tenant attended the hearing. The Tenant was represented by T.A. 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
As I explained at the
hearing held on May 25, 2018, the order that is the subject of this request for
review contains a serious error of law on its face that resulted in a serious
and material error of fact. 
2.     
When this application
initially came before the Board on April 11, 2018, the Member identified for
the parties the fact that the Landlord’s application indicates the Landlord
illegally increased the rent from $990.00 to $1,008.00 effective February 1,
2018. The reason this is an illegal rent increase is because the guideline
amount in 2018 is 1.8%. If the Landlord had served proper notice of rent
increase (‘NORI’) on the Tenant the maximum rent the Landlord could charge
would be $1,007.82.
3.     
The problem that arises here
is that the Member then amended the application to change the rent charged from
the $1,008.00 the Landlord was claiming as of February 1, 2018, to the maximum
lawful rent the Landlord could have charged if the Landlord had given proper
notice. Her order then orders the Tenant to pay rent arrears based on this new
monthly rent. 
4.     
That was actually a
jurisdictional error. The Member had no right to increase the rent in this
manner. 
5.     
Pursuant to subsection
116(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) an increase in
rent is void if the Landlord has not given proper notice and the Landlord must
give a new notice before the Landlord can take the increase. So the NORI the
Landlord served here for February 1, 2018 was invalid and void. The Landlord is
not entitled to increase the rent until and unless it serves a valid NORI. 
6.     
This means that what the
Member should have done is declare that the rent increase was invalid and the
lawful monthly rent continues to be $990.00. Because the order requires the
Tenant to pay more than that the order contains a material and serious mixed
error of law and fact. On this basis the review must be granted. 
7.     
After informing the parties
that the review must be granted and the lawful monthly rent continues to be
$990.00, the Landlord asked that the review be disposed of by simply varying
the order to reflect the correct amount owing. 
8.     
As I stated at the hearing,
in the normal course of events when a review is granted the application is
typically re-heard. However, the Board does have the power under the Board’s
Rules of Practice to simply vary the order as the Landlord asks. In this
particular instance I am not prepared to do that. 
9.     
I say this because the
Tenant’s review complains about more than simply the amount he has to pay the
Landlord. The record indicates that the Tenant represented himself at the
initial hearing held on April 11, 2018. With his request for review he filed a
letter from his treating physician that states he was not competent to
self-represent himself. As a result, simply varying the order to correct the
amounts payable would arguably result in a denial of natural justice. 
10.   Given all of the above the review was granted
and a hearing de novo ordered. 
11.   The review hearing was then adjourned at the
request of the Tenant’s representative on the basis that the Tenant had just
been released from the hospital and was too ill to attend. 
12.   Pursuant to a suggestion made by the Tenant’s
representative, the adjournment was conditional. The Board issued interim order
TEL-89342-18-RV-IN2 requiring the Tenant to pay the rent due for the month of
June into the Board in trust on or before June 1, 2018. The interim order
indicates that if the Tenant fails to comply with the interim order the Board
may refuse to consider his evidence and submissions pursuant to s. 195(4) of
the Act.
13.   When the review hearing reconvened to re-hear
the application on June 6, 2018, I discovered the Tenant had not complied with
the interim order but he had paid the Landlord $1,200.00 directly on June 4,
2018. The Landlord did not ask the Board to refuse to consider the Tenant’s
evidence or submissions. 
14.   There is no dispute that the Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from January 1,
2018 to June 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective January 29, 2018.
15.   The Tenant argues that the lawful monthly rent
is actually less than $990.00 based on income tax receipts provided to the
Tenant by the Landlord. As I stated at the hearing, the definition of “rent”
under the provincial income tax legislation is not the same as the definition
under the Act. Under the Act the lawful monthly rent is the rent charged at the
start of the tenancy plus any legal increases or decreases permitted by the
Act. Here the initial rent charged when the Tenant moved into the rental unit
was $990.00. As the Landlord has not increased or decreased the rent in
accordance with the Act that is still the lawful monthly rent for Board
purposes. 
16.   The Tenant paid $1,200.00 after the application
was filed so the arrears of rent owing for the period ending June 30, 2018 as
of the date of the hearing on June 6, 2018, total $3,690.00.
17.   The Landlord incurred costs of $175.00 for
filing the application and is entitled to reimbursement of those costs.
18.   So the only real issue between the parties is
the Tenant’s request for relief from eviction in the form of more time to pay.
The Tenant wants more time to pay because he believes his income is about to
change and he will be able to pay the arrears of rent and the monthly rent
going forward. He asks that he be given until July 31, 2018 to pay the amount
outstanding. The Landlord opposes the Tenant’s request for relief.
19.   The residential complex here is a for profit
care home with 152 beds and 100 employees. The Tenant’s rent is subsidized by
the local municipality. Non-subsidised individuals pay between $3,000.00 and
$4,500.00 a month.
20.   The Tenant moved into the residential complex in
January of 2017 into a different rental unit. He was subsequently moved to the
unit he now occupies in the spring of 2017. 
21.   The Tenant says he was born and raised in the
local area and he wants to stay. 
22.   The Tenant has multiple serious medical
conditions. The letter from his physician states he is an insulin dependent
diabetic and as a result of complications related to diabetes had a below the
knee amputation. He has impaired executive functioning, a history of mild
cognitive impairment, cirrhosis/end stage liver disease and a number of other
health challenges. 
23.   The Tenant says that when he moved into the
rental unit he did not plan to stay long term but his healing has not been
going well and he ran out of funds. He says the only service he receives from
the Landlord is food for $260.00. He applied for long-term care but was
informed his condition was such that he is not yet eligible. He also applied
for social housing. 
24.   The Tenant says that he has exhausted his
savings. Part of the reason why he has not paid the rent to the Landlord is
because he had to pay $3,000.00 for a prosthetic. He also had to pay for
transportation home from the hospital more than once. 
25.   The Landlord provided a ledger that shows the
last time the Tenant had a zero balance was December 5, 2017. Between August
and December 2017 the Tenant was late paying the rent every month. 
26.   The Tenant is in receipt of Canada Pension Plan
(‘CPP’) benefits and Old Age Security (‘OAS’). Together those total about
$1,150.00 monthly. As the total charged for rent and food is $1,250.00 the
Tenant cannot currently afford the rental unit. 
27.   About two months ago the Tenant says he applied
for the guaranteed annual income supplement (‘GIS’) but has not yet been
approved. He says that he tried to apply for GIS earlier but did not complete
the application process correctly. He has been told that he should be approved
and his entitlement would be about $400.00 to $600.00 monthly with an arrears
back payment coming to him of $5,000.00. He has also been told he would be
eligible for a supplement from the City’s Eviction Prevention in Community
(‘EPIC’) program. 
28.   The Landlord says the other residents of the
home have expressed resentment over the Tenant’s failure to pay rent as they
are aware that the amount he has to pay is considerably less than the market
rent they pay. Dealing with that resentment can be challenging. In addition,
this is a for profit business so the Landlord must cover its overhead. The
Tenant is also in arrears of his service fees for food. 
29.   Given the unavoidable passage of time that has
occurred since the hearing was held, the Tenant’s request for relief is moot.
In other words, the Tenant has gained the delay he seeks merely because of the
delay in issuing this order. So having considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, I find that it
would be unfair to grant additional relief from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act. The Tenant has either obtained the funding he was seeking by
now and will be able to void this order, or he has not, and has received the
time he asked for to find a new place to move to. Further delay would be unfair
to the Landlord. So the Board’s standard order shall issue. 
30.   This order contains all of the reasons for the
decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.
It is ordered that:
1.     
Order TEL-89342-18 issued on
May 1, 2018 is cancelled and replaced by the following: 
2.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before August 7,
2018.
3.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $4,520.34* (less any payment made by the Tenant to the Landlord after
the hearing held on June 6, 2018), which represents the amount of rent owing
and compensation up to July 27, 2018.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $32.55 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
July 28, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
5.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before August 7, 2018, then starting August 8, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after August 8, 2018.
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $4,855.00
(less any payment made by the Tenant to the Landlord after the hearing held on
June 6, 2018) if the payment is made on or before July 31, 2018, or
ii)       $5,845.00
(less any payment made by the Tenant to the Landlord after the hearing held on
June 6, 2018) if the payment is made on or before August 7, 2018**.
9.     
If the Tenant does not make
full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline,
then the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
10.   The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after August 8, 2018 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to
make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
