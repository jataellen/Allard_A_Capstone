Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-86908-17
 










 
 

Landlord’s
L1 application.
B. B. H. C.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict S. H.
and J. H. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe. The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges and related
administration charges.
 
Landlord’s
L2 application.
B. B. H. C.
(the 'Landlord') also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict S.
H. J. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants have paid their rent in a
persistently late manner. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
These
applications were heard in Peterborough on January 25, 2018.
 
Only
the Landlord attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      With
respect to the Landlord’s L1 application, the
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from September 1, 2017 to January 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective December 7, 2017.
2.      The
Landlord incurred charges of $14.00 for cheques tendered by or on behalf of the
Tenants, which were returned NSF and $40.00 for related administration charges.
3.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,000.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
4.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2017
to December 7, 2017.
5.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
6.      With
respect to the Landlord’s L2 application, the
tenants have persistently paid their rent late over the past 6 months. 
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act.
8.      The
reasons contained in this order constitute all of the reasons used in making my
decision. 
It
is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before February 12, 2018.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $3,711.40*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to February 1, 2018 and the total charges
related to NSF cheques tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenants,
less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $32.88 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 2, 2018 to the date they move out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
February 12, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from February 13, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 12, 2018, then starting February
13, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 13,
2018.
8.      If,
on or before February 12, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $5,844.00** to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. 
This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could
remain in the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that
the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after February 13, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to
the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
10.   If
the Tenants void this order as in paragraph # 8 or 9, then the Tenants will pay
to the Landlord the monthly rent when it comes due on the first day of each
month starting on March 1, 2018 and continuing until August 1, 2018 inclusive.
11.   Failure
to do as directed in paragraph # 10 will allow the Landlord to apply to the
board under Section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act (2006), without
notice to the Tenants, for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenants. The Landlord must make this application no later than 30 days after
the Tenant’s failure to make a payment. As part of this application, the Landlord
can also request an order for arrears, damages, NSF cheque fees and related
administrative charges and the cost of filing the application.
