Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: TNL-02875-18
 










 
 

TMS (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict JAH (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also
claimed NSF cheque charges and related administration charges.
 
This application was
heard in Newmarket on June 4, 2018.
 
SFL
(Monique) for the Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
SJ
represented the Landlord.
 
Determinations:
 
Preliminary
issues:
1.      This
matter and the Tenant’s application, HOT-02033-17 came before the Board on
April 9, 2018. The matter was adjourned because the Tenant was injured. 
2.      I denied
the Landlord’s requests for costs related to the adjournment because the Tenant
provided sufficient evidence to support the reason given for the adjournment
request.
3.      The Member
issued an interim order on April 9, 2018 with respect to both matters requiring
that the Tenant pay the rent to the Landlord from May 1, 2018, and each month
by the first until these matters were resolved. The interim order also provided
that a Member may refuse to accept or consider the Tenant’s evidence and
submissions if the Tenant did not comply.  
4.      I
determined that the Tenant did not comply with the interim order. Her evidence
that she paid the Landlord by putting two money orders through a garage door at
an address of a house that the Landlord no longer owns is not sufficient. The
Landlord denies receiving the rent for May on the first or on any other day.
5.      As such, the
Tenant’s application was not heard with the Landlord’s application and is
adjourned to be heard on a date to be set by the Board
L1
application:
6.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from January 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective February 27, 2018.
7.      The
Landlord incurred charges of $28.00 for cheques tendered by or on behalf of the
Tenant, which were returned NSF and $80.00 for related administration charges.
8.      The Tenant
stated that she paid the rent for June 2018 by delivering a cheque to the
Landlord’s representative’s office; however, the Landlord’s representative
could not confirm that it was received. As such, this payment is not included
as a payment in this order. There is otherwise no dispute that the arrears are
as claimed by the Landlord.
9.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $3,300.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
10.   Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 21, 2017
to February 27, 2018.
11.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). The Landlord
requested a ‘standard’ 11 day order. The Tenant asked that she have until the
end of August, the termination date in a subsequent notice from the Landlord.
Considering the circumstances, in particular the quantum of the arears, that no
rent has been paid for months and that this is a relatively short tenancy, I find
that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.
It is
ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before June 18, 2018.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,296.73*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to June 7, 2018 and the total charges related to
NSF cheques tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of
the Tenant, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $54.25 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting June 8, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June
18, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from June 19, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before June 18, 2018, then starting June 19,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 19, 2018.
8.      If,
on or before June 18, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $10,198.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after June 19, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
