 (‘CF’) and (‘HF’, the 'Landlords') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict (‘TS’) and (‘DC’, the 'Tenants')
because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe; because the
Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation; and because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone
they permitted in the residential complex have wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises. The Landlords also claimed compensation for each
day the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date. The Landlords
also applied for an order requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlords for
the damage.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on February 25,
2020.
 
The Landlords, the Landlords’
representative, JG, the Tenant TS and the Tenants’ representative, RH, attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
At the hearing, the
Landlords withdrew their applications to terminate the tenancy and claim
compensation for damage to the property and to terminate the tenancy for the
Landlords’ own use.  
 
2.     
The Tenants’ application
TNT-21167-19 was severed from these applications and adjourned to a date to be
set by the Board.
 
3.     
The lawful monthly rent for
the rental unit is $1,400.00.  Although the Landlords claimed at the hearing
that the lawful rent is $1,500.00, the evidence adduced at the hearing shows
that the Landlords at no time during the tenancy served the Tenants a notice of
rent increase under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).  
 
4.     
In Price v. Turnbull’s
Grove Inc., 2007 ONCA 408 (CanLII), [2007] O.J. No. 2177 (C.A.) the Court of Appeal for Ontario
determined that a rent increase is void where the landlord has not served a
proper notice of rent increase under the Act.  Subsection 136(1) of the Act
therefore does not save the illegal rent increase, as the increase is a legal
nullity.
 
5.     
I also find that the Tenants
did not consent to increase the rent from $1,400.00 to $1,500.00.  Despite any
outward appearance of an agreement to increase the rent, the evidence adduced
at the hearing shows that no additional facility or service was provided the
Tenants in exchange for raising the rent by $100.00, pursuant to subsection
123(1) of the Act.  I agree with the Tenants’ representative that subsection
3(1) of the Act prohibits parties from contracting out of the Act’s
provisions.  Accordingly, I conclude that parties to a tenancy may not consent
to increase the rent without the provision of additional services and/or
facilities.
 
6.     
The lawful rent is therefore
$1,400.00.
 
7.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September
15, 2019 to November 30, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a
Notice of Termination effective October 18, 2019.
 
8.     
At the hearing, the Tenant
TS did not dispute that the Tenants did not pay all of the rent they were
required to pay for the period September 15, 2019 to November 30, 2019.  The
Tenants vacated the rental unit on November 30, 2019.
 
9.     
The Landlords collected a
rent deposit of $1,400.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlords.
 
10.  
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from September 16, 2019 to October 18,
2019.
 
11.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.  The Tenants vacated the rental unit on November
30, 2019.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlords and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants moved out of the rental
unit on November 30, 2019.
 
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlords $2,161.05*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to November 30, 2019, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
4.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before March 27, 2020, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from March
28, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
