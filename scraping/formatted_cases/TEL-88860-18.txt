Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-88860-18
 










 
 
 

M.
O. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict R. J
M. and J. A F. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe. The Landlord also claimed administration charges related to
NSF cheques.
 
This
application was heard in Whitby on April 3, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      There
is no dispute between the parties that the Tenants have not paid the total rent
they were required to pay for the period from February 1, 2018 to April 30,
2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective February 16, 2018.
2.      There
is also no dispute that as of the date of the hearing before the Board the
arrears of rent owing totalled $4,000.00. 
3.      The
Landlord seeks consent to amend his application to include charges related to
two NSF cheques tendered by the Tenants after the application was filed. That
request is granted. The Tenants knew of the NSF cheques. The Landlord is
entitled to $40.00 for administration charges related to cheques tendered by or
on behalf of the Tenants, which were returned NSF. Absent evidence of the
amount of bank fees actually charged to the Landlord as a result of these
cheques I am not prepared to order the $40.00 claimed for banking fees. 
4.      The
Landlord incurred costs of $175.00 for filing the application and is entitled
reimbursement of those costs.
5.     The
Tenants put forward two arguments. First, they argue that the Landlord should
not be entitled to the order sought because they did not receive notice of
termination as required by section 59 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act'). Second, and in the alternative, they seek relief from eviction in
the form of a repayment plan.
6.     The
difficulty with the Tenants’ first argument is that although the Act requires
notice be given, subsection 191(1) deems the notice to have been sufficiently
given provided the landlord delivered it in one of the approved methods whether
the tenant received it or not. 
7.     Here,
the Landlord says that on February 2, 2018 he left the notice of termination in
the Tenants’ mailbox. That is one of the permitted methods of service. 
8.     So
the issue is not whether or not the Tenants actually received the notice of termination,
the question is whether or not the Landlord is telling the truth when he says
he placed it in the mailbox. Obviously, the Tenants’ testimony that they did
not receive the notice is one evidentiary factor to be considered, but it is
not the only factor. This is because it is possible that both parties are
telling the truth: namely that the Landlord placed the documents in the mailbox
but it somehow went astray so the Tenants did not actually receive it. 
9.     In
this circumstance that is a possibility as the mailbox is not secure and is
shared with another set of tenants. In addition, the Landlord produced and
entered into evidence text messages between the parties in which he explicitly
refers to the notice of termination. Those texts were written prior to the
application being filed. No responding texts from the Tenants were produced in
which they say they did not receive any notice. So the texts support the
Landlord’s evidence that he delivered the notice of termination by placing it
in the mailbox. 
10.  The
Tenants argue the Landlord has lied before and should not be found to be
credible. I asked them for particulars. In response to that question they
alleged that the Landlord lied to them about the utilities company cutting off
service. In response to that the Landlord produced a shut off notice from the
municipality. Although the Tenants offered other examples of the Landlord being
untruthful, the evidence is simply insufficient to make a finding that the
Landlord has a propensity for lying. 
11.  As a
result, I am satisfied that the Landlord’s evidence regarding the notice is
credible and I find that the Tenants were given notice of termination as
required by the Act.
12.  That
leaves the Tenants’ request for relief in the form of a repayment plan. As I
explained at the hearing, pursuant to s. 83(1) of the Act the question the
Board must answer is whether or not it would be unfair in all of the
circumstances to grant the relief requested.
13.  This is a
relatively new tenancy having started in June of 2017. This is the second time
the Landlord has filed application with the Board for non-payment of rent since
the tenancy began. The Tenants live in the rental unit with one adult son.
14.  According
to the Tenants they fell behind due to illness and lack of work. 
15.  They say
that in December of 2017 the second named Tenant above was hospitalised for two
days due to an abscess. No other details or corroborating documentation was
provided. 
16.  He runs
an HVAC company and jobs slowed down after Christmas. According to the Tenants
he has five jobs lined up so they should be able to afford the proposed
repayment plan. The first named Tenant also works and earns about $500.00 a
week doing day care outside the home. Again no corroborating documentary
evidence was provided. 
17.  The
Landlord says that he is a real estate professional and not a full-time
Landlord. He owns one rental property with two units of which this is one. He
says he is experiencing financial hardship as his real estate business is down.
He is late paying the mortgage, has been charged penalties by the municipality
for late payment of taxes, has $22,000.00 owing on his credit cards as well as
a similar sum owing on his lines of credit. He has five children, two of whom
are in university. They are late with their school fees. His spouse does not
work. He is concerned that the Tenants lack of payment of utilities will result
in a cut off that will impact the other tenants in the residential complex. The
Landlord also provided no corroborating documentary evidence. 
18.  Given all
of the evidence before the Board and having considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, I find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
the Act. 
19.  I say
this for two reasons. First and most importantly, the Tenants’ behaviour in the
past indicates their promises to pay cannot be believed. They freely
acknowledge they have broken various promises to pay in the past. There is no
evidence before the Board except the Tenants’ assurances that indicates this
behaviour is more likely than not to change in the future. Second, the Tenants’
non-payment appears to be causing the Landlord financial hardship. He needs
prompt payment of the amount outstanding or the unit back immediately so he can
rent it out to someone else. 
20.  As a
result, the Tenants’ request for relief in the form of a repayment plan must be
denied. 
21.  Given the
amount of time that has passed since the hearing of this application and the
Tenants’ further alternative request that they be allowed to stay to the end of
the current month, relief in the form of further delay is not warranted. The
Board’s standard voidable eviction order shall issue. 
22.  The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,500.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
23.  Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from June 1, 2017 to
February 16, 2018 totalling $19.31.
24.  If the
Tenants do not void this order by paying the amount outstanding then the
deposit and the interest shall be applied to the rent arrears owing. 
25.  This
order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further
reasons shall be issued.
It
is ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before May 18, 2018.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $2,755.33*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to May 7, 2018 and the total charges related to
NSF cheques tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenants, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $49.32 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting May 8, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May 18,
2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from May 19, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before May 18, 2018, then starting May 19, 2018,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 19, 2018.
8.      If,
on or before May 18, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $5,715.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after May 19, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
