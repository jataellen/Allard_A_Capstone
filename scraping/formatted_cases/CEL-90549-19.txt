Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-90549-19
 











 
 
 

C.S. and D.M. (the 'Landlords') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict I.W. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did
not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Mississauga on January
22, 2020.
 
The Landlords and the Tenant
attended the hearing.  The Landlords were represented by J.P.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from August 15, 2019
to February 14, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of
Termination effective November 13, 2019.
2.     
The Tenant says she does not
agree with the arrears the Landlords have claimed on their update sheet
provided to the Board at the hearing.  The Tenant says she has had issues with
the rental unit at which point I asked if she was prepared with all of her
evidence of these issues to have them heard under section 82 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').  She is not.  As I said at the hearing,
her claims will not be heard at this time, but this does not prevent her from
filing her own application.
3.     
The Tenant further states
that she does not agree with the amount because she made payment to the
Landlord in August, 2019 for the August 15, 2019 rent.  The payment was made in
cash at the Landlords’ convenience store while she was on her way to drop off
her children to school.  After she dropped off her children she had an absent
seizure, which she gets often, and these seizures tend to effect her memory.
4.     
Before making the payment,
she took the full amount of $2,100.00 out of her bank account.  The Tenant did
not submit any bank statements to substantiate this withdrawal from her
account.
5.     
Given the lack of evidence
provided by the Tenant regarding the payment, I find that she did not make the
payment as she claims.  The amount noted on the notice of termination is
correct and this order reflects the proper amount owed to the Landlord.
6.     
The Tenant seeks relief of
eviction by way of a repayment plan.  The plan would consist of a payment of
$500.00 beginning February 1, 2020 and rent on the fifteenth until the arrears
are paid in full.  
7.     
The Tenant receives a
$3,180.00 income of assistance and child tax credits each month.  Her expenses
are between $650.00 and $750.00 depending on how much is spent on food.  This
leaves the Tenant approximately $430.00 to $330.00 a month left over after rent
is paid.  
8.     
When I asked why the Tenant
had not made any partial payments to mitigate the situation the Tenant response
that she di did not want to pay and then be forced to leave.
9.     
The Landlords oppose the
Tenant’s request for a repayment plan stating it is too long at 22 months.  The
Landlords also state that the Tenant has not attempted to help her situation by
holding on to the rent.
10.  
The problem with the
Tenant’s request is that if I believe she has not been paying because she does
not want to pay and leave, it would mean that she has the money and would be
able to pay the Landlords in full and void any order.  This does not seem to be
the case.  
11.  
Also, based on the Tenant’s
own numbers, her monthly amount after expenses is not adequate to meet the
proposed repayment plan of $500.00 a month.  
12.  
In the alternative, the
Tenant asks for a delay in termination to January 31, 2020.  Although this
delay would only be an extra ten days, I find that any delay would be
detrimental to both parties financially.  As of January 15, 2020, a new month
of rent comes due putting the arrears at $12,600.00.  
13.  
As a result, I find any
delay would be inappropriate in this circumstance and an order with standard
terms shall issue.
14.  
The Landlords collected a
rent deposit of $2,100.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlords.
15.  
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from December 12, 2018 to November 13,
2019.
16.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
17.  
This order contains all of
the reasons for the decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before January
21, 2020.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlords $8,140.53*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 10, 2020, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $69.04 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
January 11, 2020 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before January 21, 2020, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
January 22, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 21, 2020, then starting January 22, 2020, the Landlords
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlords, on or after January 22, 2020.
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlords or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $10,690.00 if the payment is made on or before January 14, 2020, or
ii)       $12,790.00 if the payment is made on or before January 21, 2020**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after January 22, 2020 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlords.
