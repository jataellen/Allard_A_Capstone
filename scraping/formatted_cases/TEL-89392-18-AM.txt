P.M.L.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict N.A.D.A.
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes and
has been persistently late paying the rent.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on May 15, 2018. Only
the Landlord attended the hearing. The Landlord was represented by S.A.A..
 
This amended order is issued to correct a clerical error in the
original order issued on May 17, 2018.
 
Determinations:
THE
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from December 1, 2017 to May 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective February 28, 2018.
2.      The
lawful monthly rent is $1,157.10. The Landlord served a notice of rent increase
(‘NORI’) purporting to raise the rent from $1,157.10 to $1,177.93
effective March 1, 2018. This rent increase is more than the guideline amount of
1.8%. It appears that the Landlord rounded up the increase to the next cent.
Rounding up rent increases is not permitted under the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act') as it inevitably results in an increase that is in
excess of the guideline amount. As a result, the NORI served here is invalid
and the lawful monthly rent remains at $1,157.10 until the Landlord serves a
valid NORI.
3.      The
Tenant paid $1,157.00 after the application was filed. As a result, the rent
arrears owing for the period ending May 31, 2018 total $3,471.50.
4.      The
Landlord incurred costs of $190.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
5.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,140.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
6.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from February 15,
2016 to February 28, 2018 totalling $38.43.
THE APPLICATION
FOR PERSISTENT LATE PAYMENT OF RENT
7.      The
Tenant has persistently paid the rent late. Since April of 2017 the Tenant has
never paid rent on time. 
RELIEF
FROM EVICTION
8.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Act. The Landlord asks that the Tenant be given an opportunity to
preserve the tenancy by paying the rent arrears owing and new rent on time and
in full for the following year. As a result and absent any other evidence of
the Tenant’s circumstances, I find that it would be unfair to grant relief from
eviction with respect to the non-payment of rent application beyond the Board’s
standard voidable eviction order but it would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction if the arrears are paid in full subject to the conditions set out
in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.

9.      This order
contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
It
is ordered that:
THE
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated for non-payment of rent.  The Tenant must move out
of the rental unit on or before May 28, 2018.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,788.89*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to May 17, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $38.04 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting May 18, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May 28,
2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from May 29, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before May 28, 2018, then starting May 29, 2018,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 29, 2018.
8.      If,
on or before May 28, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $3,661.50** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this part of the order for eviction will be
void.  This means that the tenancy would not be terminated for non-payment of
rent and the Tenant could remain in the unit subject to the conditions set out
below.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after May 29, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
THE
APPLICATION FOR PERSISTENT LATE PAYMENT OF RENT
10.   If
the Tenant voids the eviction order above pursuant to paragraph 8 or 9 then:
(1)  The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord new rent on time and in full for the period
June 1, 2018 to May 31, 2019. 
(2)  If the
Tenant fails to make any one of the payments in accordance with subparagraph
10(1) of this order then the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant, apply
to the Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the
tenancy and evicting the Tenant and requiring that the Tenant pay any new
arrears, NSF fees and related charges that became owing after May 31, 2018.
