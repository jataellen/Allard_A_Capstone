Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-20735-19
 











 
 
 

SP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict SM (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed NSF
cheque charges.
 
This application was heard in Newmarket on January 6,
2020.
 
The Landlord, the Tenant, and the
Tenant’s legal representative, GO, attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from August 29, 2019
to January 28, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination.
 
2.     
The Landlord incurred
charges of $28.00 for cheques tendered by or on behalf of the Tenant, which
were returned NSF.
 
3.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,750.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
 
4.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from March 8, 2019 to January 29, 2020.
 
5.     
The Tenant moved into the
rental unit in March, 2019 with her children.  Upon request by the Tenant to
change the rent period to the end of the month, the Landlord agreed in May,
2019, to make the rent payable on the 29th day of the month.
 
6.      The Tenant requests a payment plan.  She said
that she has been the victim of domestic violence, and this has caused trauma
to her and her family.  She also said that she has constantly been in criminal
and family court over the last few months to sort out her domestic problems.
 
7.      The Tenant said that she was working when she
moved into the rental unit, but she had to leave her job in October, 2019.  She
said that she will return to work on January 21, 2020.
 
8.      The Tenant testified that her monthly income
from work will be about $2,600.00, and that she receives a child tax benefit of
$1,600.00 per month.  She said that she was supposed to receive child support
of $987.00 per month, and that she is also supposed to receive proceeds from
the sale of her marital home.
 
9.      The Tenant proposed paying $1,000.00 towards
arrears in addition to the full rent going forward.  She said that if she is
evicted she will be homeless.  The Tenant testified that she has been in a
shelter with her family, and that there is a long wait list for family
shelters.
 
10.   The Tenant said that she will be able to pay up
all the arrears by the end of February, 2020, if she receives the money that
she is owed by her husband.
 
11.   The Landlord is seeking eviction.  She said that
the Tenant has failed to pay the rent on time since she moved into the rental
unit in March, 2019.  She said that she agreed to accept the rent at the end of
the month in May, 2019, because the Tenant told her she had lost her job at
that time.
 
12.   The Landlord said that she relies on the rent to
pay her mortgage, and that she has already had to acquire a further loan to
cover her mortgage payments because the Tenant has failed to pay the rent.
 
13.   I find that, although the Tenant has had many
unfortunate circumstances in her life, she failed to explain why she has only
paid $950.00 towards the rent in six months.  She has not made any good faith
payments towards the rent at all since the beginning of November, 2019.  The tenancy
has not been a long one, and the Landlord has already suffered prejudice
because of the Tenant’s inability to pay the rent.  There is also no certainty
about when the Tenant will have work income, or when she will be paid the
amounts she is owed by her husband.
 
14.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find, based on the above, that it
would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 28, 2020, pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.  The postponement of the eviction date
permits the Tenant a little more time to receive the funds she is expecting
from her husband, or to find an alternative place to live.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before February
28, 2020.
 
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $6,653.71*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to February 11, 2020 and the total charges related to NSF cheques tendered
to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $43.15 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
February 12, 2020 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 22, 2020, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
February 23, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 28, 2020, then starting February 29, 2020, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 29, 2020.
 
8.     
If, on or before February
28, 2020, the Tenant pays the amount of $9,753.00** to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after February 29, 2020 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
