Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-22453-19
 











 
 

GHL (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict EW (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on February 25,
2020.
 
The Landlord’s representative, MB
and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from November 1, 2019
to February 29, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective November 20, 2019.
2.     
The monthly rent as of the
date of the hearing is $1,138.91.
3.     
There was no dispute that
the Tenant owes the Landlord $4,745.11, which represents the arrears of rent to
February 29, 2020 ($4,555.11) and the application filing fee ($190.00).
4.     
The Tenant moved into the
unit on September 15, 2017. 
5.     
The Tenant testified that he
has not been working since November 24, 2019 and has no income. The Tenant
stated that he anticipates having an interview for an employment position soon.

6.     
The Tenant requested relief
and stated that he was going to sell some of his belongings to get half of the
arrears and will try to get a loan for the balance of the arrears. The Tenant
did not have the funds to pay March 2020 rent.
7.     
The Landlord opposed any
relief, and submitted that this is the third time the parties have been before
the Board on this tenancy.  
8.     
At this time, I am not
persuaded that the Tenant has the financial means to sustain this tenancy and
pay the arrears or the monthly rent. The Tenant does not have a source of
income and there are no guarantees that the Tenant will obtain employment. I
also considered that the Tenant cannot pay the monthly rent when due, which
means the Tenant will continue to fall further into arrears. 
9.     
As I stated at the hearing,
the Tenant should have taken steps prior to the hearing to either sell some of
his belongings or obtain the loan to pay the arrears. 
10.  
The Tenant requested three
weeks to move out of the unit. 
11.  
The Sheriff’s office
currently takes at least two and usually three weeks to enforce an eviction
order after the enforcement date. What this means is that the Tenant may
already have three weeks before the Sheriff enforces the order.  As such, I do
not have to delay the eviction.
12.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before March 10,
2020.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $4,492.34*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to February 28, 2020.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $37.44 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
February 29, 2020 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March 10, 2020, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from March
11, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 10, 2020, then starting March 11, 2020, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 11, 2020.
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $4,745.11 if the payment is made on or before February 29, 2020, or
ii)       $5,884.02 if the payment is made on or before March 10, 2020**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March 11, 2020 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
