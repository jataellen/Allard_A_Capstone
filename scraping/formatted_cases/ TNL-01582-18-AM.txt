Tenant



 
Oleg
Ovchinnikov and Victoria Ovchinnikova (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Raheb Gholamreza Sadigh (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Newmarket on March 26, 2018.
 
The Landlords, the Landlords’ representative, A.
Bon, the Tenant and the Tenant’s representative (friend) Ardalan Robati,
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from February 15, 2017 to April 14, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective January 25, 2018.
 
2.      At
the hearing, the Tenant’s representative disputed the Landlords’ evidence of
the Tenant’s rental arrears.  The Tenant’s representative testified that he
loaned the Tenant $250.00 in February 2017, to help the Tenant
pay that month’s rent.  The Tenant’s representative gave evidence of his belief
that the Tenant paid the $250.00 balance of February 2017’s rent
to the Landlord.   
 
3.      The
Landlords’ ledger shows that the Landlords credited the Tenant with a $250.00
rental payment in February 2017.  The Landlords also testified
that they received only $250.00 for February 2017.
 
4.      The
Tenant did not give evidence of any rental payment in February 2018.
 
5.      I
prefer the Landlords’ sworn testimony of the Tenant’s $250.00 rental payment in
February 2017 over the Tenant’s representative’s evidence of his
belief of what amount may have been paid to the Landlords in February 2017. 
The Landlords’ testimony was based on their own memories of events in February
2017, and the testimony was supported by the Landlords’ business
record.
 
6.      The
Tenant’s representative confirmed that the Tenant paid $480.00 of the $500.00
monthly rent in April 2017.
 
7.      I
therefore find that the Tenant’s rental arrears for the period ending April14,
2018 are $5,270.00.  The Tenant’s monthly rent is due and payable on the 15th
day of each month.
 
8.      The
Landlords collected a rent deposit of $500.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
9.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 16,
2015 to January 25, 2018.
 
10.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until April 30, 2018,
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
11.   At
the hearing, the Tenant’s representative requested an order requiring the
Tenant to pay the amount that he owes to the Landlord, by paying an additional
$100.00 each month with the Tenant’s rent.
 
12.   The
Landlords opposed relief from eviction.  The Landlords testified that, because
of a seriously ill grandchild, the Landlords have reduced their employment
activities.  The Landlords therefore rely on the Tenant’s rental payments to
meet the Landlords’ regular financial obligations.  Because of the Tenant’s
rental arrears, the Landlords have experienced financial hardship.  
 
13.   I
find that, under the circumstances, the Tenant’s proposal to pay the amount
that he owes to the Landlords is unreasonable.  The Tenant’s proposal would not
bring his account with the Landlords to a $0.00 balance within a reasonable
period of time.
 
14.   However,
the Tenant is a person with a disability, and the Landlords are holding the
Tenant’s last month’s rental deposit.
 
15.   I
therefore find that it is not unfair to postpone the eviction date to April 30,
2018.  This will give the Tenant time to either pay the amount that he owes to
continue the tenancy, or to find new accommodations.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before April 30, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $4,465.74*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to March 29, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $16.44 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting March 30, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before April
30, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from May 1, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 30, 2018, then starting May 1, 2018,
the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after May 1, 2018.
 
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlords or to the Board in trust:
i)        $5,460.00 if the payment is made on or before April 14, 2018, or
ii)       $5,960.00 if the payment is made on or before April 30, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after May 1, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlords. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
