Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-07999-20
 











 
 
 

A.P. Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict D.G. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on March 11,
2020.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant’s friend,
J.C., attended the hearing. The Landlord was represented by S.H. 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from December 1, 2019
to March 31, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective December 26, 2019.
2.     
The Tenant paid $1,275.00 since
the application was filed. 
3.     
The arrears and costs owing to
March 13, 2020 total $3,996.80.
4.     
The Landlord seeks a standard,
voidable eleven-day order.
TENANT’S EVIDENCE
5.     
The Tenant does not dispute the
amount outstanding but is unable to pay the full balance in eleven days. 
6.     
He says the reason he fell into
arrears was because he was off work for two weeks in December 2019 and January 2020
which resulted in the accrual of arrears. In addition, there is a garnishment issued
by the Canadian Revenue Agency (CRA) leaving him with less income to make ends meet.

7.     
The Tenant seeks relief in
the form of a repayment plan where he would pay an additional $1,000.00 this month,
$1,500.00 in April 2020 and the balance in May 2020 on top of the monthly rent to
catch up. 
8.     
His total monthly income is approximately
$2,400.00 after the garnishment takes effect. 
9.     
His monthly expenses total $2,574.36
which is inclusive of his rent, car insurance, gas expenses, grocery and utility
bills, cable and cellphone bills. 
10.  
The Landlord opposes the Tenant
’s repayment plan request as she finds it to be unrealistic. She submits that when
the income is subtracted from the expenses, it appears that the Tenant is already
overspending $174.36 per month. Therefore, it is unclear how the Tenant will be
able to afford a further $1,000.00 – $1,500.00 each month to pay towards the arrears.
Furthermore, this is not the first occasion that the Tenant has been brought to
the Board on an application for arrears of rent.
11.  
The Tenant ’s response was that
the CRA deducted incorrect amounts and that they have been notified and the issue
has been rectified. The Tenant failed to submit documentary evidence to support
this assertion. 
12.  
Based on the evidence before
the Board, I share the Landlord’s concern that the Tenant may not have enough income
to satisfy the arrears and new rent that becomes due. However, if what the Tenant
is saying is true, then there is a potential for more income meaning the Tenant
may well be able to keep to the proposed repayment plan. Thus, to give the Tenant
the benefit of the doubt, his repayment plan is granted. 
13.  
If the Tenant has not done so
already, the first payment of $1,000.00 that the Tenant proposed to pay on March
12, 2020, shall be due and payable within 11 days from the date of this order. 
14.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
15.  
This order contains all of
the reasons for my decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.  
It is ordered that:
1.   
The arrears and costs owing to
March 31, 2020 total $3,996.80.
2.   
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$3,996.80 as follows: 
a)   
$1,000.00 on or before April
11, 2020, if not done so already on March 12, 2020; 
b)   
$1,500.00 on or before April
23, 2020; and
c)   
$1,496.80 on or before May 15,
2020. 
3.   
The Tenant shall also pay
the monthly rent on or before the first day of every month for the months of April
and May 2020. 
4.   
If the Tenant fails to make any
one of the payments in accordance with this order, the outstanding balance shall
become immediately due and owing and the Landlord may, without notice to the
Tenant, apply to the Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order
terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant and requiring that the Tenant
pay any new arrears, NSF fees and related charges that became owing after March
31, 2020.
