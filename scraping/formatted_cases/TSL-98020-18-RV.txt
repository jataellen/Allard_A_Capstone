Order under Section 21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-98020-18-RV










 
 

Review Order
 
P.P.L.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict S.A.M
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was resolved by order TSL-98020-18 issued on September 10, 2018.
 
On
October 30, 2018, the Tenant requested an extension of time for filing a review
request and the request for review of the order.  The extension of time was
granted, interim order TSL-98020-18 -RV-IN was issued staying the order issued
on September 30, 2018, and the Board scheduled a review hearing.
 
The
request to review was heard in Toronto on November 21, 2018.
 
The
Landlord’s representative, S.K, and the Tenant attended the hearing.
            
Determinations:
 
Review
1.     
The Tenant’s request for a review is based on an allegation that
she was not reasonably able to participate in the proceedings.
 
2.     
The hearing giving rise to the order under review took place on September
4, 2018.
 
3.      At
the review hearing the Tenant testified that she was not aware that there was a
hearing on September 4, 2018. The Tenant’s testimony was not particularly
cogent. In her request for a review she stated that she has memory issues and
takes a strong pain medication and as a result she forwards her important mail
to her social worker. I asked the Tenant if she was on this mediation at the
hearing and she said yes.
 
4.      A
worker from the EPIC eviction prevention program attended the hearing and
advised that the Tenant has applied for assistance through EPIC and has been
approved. 
5.      The
Divisional Court has found that the grounds of “not reasonably able to
participate” must be interpreted broadly. I am also required to take the
Tenant’s disabilities into account. Interpreting this situation broadly, and
taking the Tenant’s disabilities into account, I am satisfied, on a balance of
probabilities, that the Tenant was not reasonably able to participate in the hearing.
The Tenant testified that she was unaware of the hearing and this makes sense
given the circumstances. When the Tenant became aware of the order she took
steps to ensure her arrears would be paid by the EPIC program. This
demonstrates a genuine intention to continue the tenancy, and, by extension, to
participate in the proceedings which determine whether the tenancy continues.
6.      For
the reasons given above, at the hearing I granted the Tenant’s request for a
review. The Landlord’s application proceeded de novo.
L1
application
7.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from July 1, 2018 to November 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 25, 2018.
8.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $825.58 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
9.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 1, 2018 to
July 25, 2018.
10.   The
Tenant paid $2,539.93 after the application was filed.
11.   The
Landlord also seeks an order for $324.00 which is the cost the Landlord
incurred to file TSL-98020-18 issued on September 10, 2018 with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) for enforcement. This amount is non-refundable. In
support of his request the Landlord’s legal representative submitted a copy of
board order TEL-82636-17-RV, in which the Vice Chair ordered the tenant in that
matter to compensate the Landlord for the Sheriff’s fee.
12.   Order
TEL-82636-17-RV is very well written and persuasive but is distinguishable from
this case. In TEL-82636-17-RV the Vice Chair found that the tenant in that
matter had a history of appearing at the Board multiple times and so was aware
of the processes of the Board, including the procedure for voiding an order. It
is clear from TEL-82636-17-RV that the tenant is a competent person who was
capable of engaging Board processes. In the case before me, the Tenant does not
have any such history and appears incapable of engaging Board processes without
assistance. 
13.   Under
these circumstances, I find that it would not be fair to order the Tenant to
compensate the Landlord for the non-refundable Sheriff’s fee. 
14.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act. At the hearing the EPIC worker advised that the
Tenant’s arrears would be cleared up well in advance of 11 days from the date
of the order.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
request to review is granted. Order TSL-98020-18 issued on September 10, 2018
is cancelled and replaced by the following order.
2.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before December 15, 2018.
3.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $714.24*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to December 4, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $27.14 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting December 5, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
5.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before December 15, 2018, then starting December
16, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after December 16,
2018.
8.      If,
on or before December 15, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $2,425.76** to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. 
This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain
in the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after December 16, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
