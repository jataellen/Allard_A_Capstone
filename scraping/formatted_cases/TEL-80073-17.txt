Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-80073-17
 










 
 

Landlords’
L1 application.
P.D.
(P.D.) and T.D. (T.D.) (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict T.T. (T.T.) (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes.
 
Landlords’
L2 application.
The
'Landlords' also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
'Tenant' because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the
Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with
the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlords or another tenant. The Landlords also claimed compensation for each
day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
Tenant’s
T2 application.
The
'Tenant' applied for an order determining that the
'Landlords') harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with the
Tenant and substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental
unit or residential complex by the Tenant or by a member of the Tenant's
household.
 
These
applications were heard in Toronto on June 27, 2017.
 
The
Landlords (T.D.), the Landlords’ representative A.L. (A.L.) and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      With
respect to the Landlords’ L1 application, the
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from February 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective April 10, 2017.
2.      The
Landlords collected a rent deposit of $1,000.00 from the Tenant and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlords.
3.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 14,
2016 to April 10, 2017.
4.      The
Tenant paid $1,000.00 after the application was filed.
5.      With
respect to the Landlords’ L2 application, the
Tenant was served with an N5 notice on March 25, 2017.
6.      As
no activity occurred for the next 7 days this notice has been found to be
voided and therefore the L2 application was dismissed.
7.      With
respect to the Tenant’s T2 application, the
Tenant was unable to provide any evidence that there had been any altercations
with the Landlord with the exception of possible noise coming from the tenants
that live above the Tenant.
8.      The
Landlord will be ordered to investigate the problem.
9.      If
the Tenant is still not satisfied with the outcome the Tenant may file another
T2 application.
10.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until July 15, 2017 pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
11.   The
reasons contained in this order constitute all of the reasons used in making my
decision. 
It
is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before July 15, 2017.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $1,183.46*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to June 30, 2017, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $32.88 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting July 1, 2017 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before July
15, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from July 16, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before July 15, 2017, then starting July 16,
2017, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after July 16, 2017.
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlords or to the Board in trust:
i)        $2,390.00 if the payment is made on or before June 30, 2017, or
ii)       $3,390.00 if the payment is made on or before July 15, 2017**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after July 16, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlords. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
10.   The
Landlords will investigate noise complaints that have been levelled against the
tenants that live in the upper unit and take action if required or justifiable.
