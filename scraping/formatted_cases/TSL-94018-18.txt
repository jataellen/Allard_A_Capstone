Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-94018-18
 











 
 

A.S.L and #.O.I (the 'Landlords') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict V.T (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did
not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on April 23,
2018.
 
The Landlords, the Landlords’
legal representative, R.B, and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
 
Preliminary Issue:
Is there a valid tenancy agreement?
 
1.     
The Landlords served a
Notice to End Your Tenancy for Non-payment of Rent on the Tenant on March 1,
2018 (the “N4”) indicating that the Tenant had not paid the monthly rent for 42
Radlett Avenue (the “Radlett property”) for the months from April 5, 2017 to
March 4, 2017, for the total arrears of $18,700.00, with a termination date of
March 22, 2018.
2.     
The Landlords filed an L1
application with the Board on March 26, 2018 for the eviction of the Tenant for
non-payment of the rent and to collect the rent that the Tenant owes.
3.     
The Landlords previously filed
an L1 application with the Board, involving the same Tenant and property, on
the basis of an N4 Notice served on the Tenant on May 1, 2017, indicating that
the Tenant had not paid the monthly rent for the months from April 16, 2017 to
May 15, 2017.
4.     
That application was heard
on June 29, 2017, and the Board issued an order dismissing the Landlord’s
application on July 6, 2017 (TSL-85327). The Board was not satisfied that there
was a tenancy agreement between the parties with respect to the Radlett property.  
The application was dismissed without prejudice to the Landlord so that the
Landlord could apply to the Board, if other matters arose, with documentary
and/or other persuasive evidence to demonstrate that there was a tenancy
agreement between the parties with respect to the Radlett property.
5.     
The Landlord subsequently
filed another application to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant on the
basis that the Landlord required possession of the rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation.  This matter was heard on September 8, 2017 and
February 2, 2018.  On February 26, 2018, the Board dismissed the application,
but found that there was a Tenancy agreement between the parties (TSL-86880-17).
6.     
There is no evidence before
me that Order TSL-86880-17 has been overturned on a review or appeal.  The
issue of whether there was a tenancy agreement between the parties with respect
to the Radlett property has been finally decided, and the legal doctrine of res
judicata would prevent a re-litigation of the same issue before this Board.

7.     
Having perused both Orders
and in light of the evidence before me, I adopt the findings in Order
TSL-86880-17 that there was a tenancy agreement between the parties. Accordingly,
I am satisfied that I have the jurisdiction to consider the merits of the Landlords’
current L1 application before me.
Determinations:
L1
8.     
It is not in dispute between
the parties that the Tenant moved into the Radlett property and has occupied it
since the first week of April 2017 without paying any rent.
9.     
The parties disagree on what
the lawful monthly rent is.  The Tenant takes the position that the parties had
not agreed on the amount of the rent for the Radlett property. 
10.  
As already stated above,
there is a valid tenancy agreement between the parties. The Landlords’ claim
that the monthly rent is $1,700.00 was also confirmed in Order TSL-86880-17. 
11.  
I am therefore satisfied on
a balance of probabilities, that the monthly rent is $1,700.00 and that the
Tenant owes the Landlord rent from April 5, 2017 to April 30, 2018.
Section 82
12.  
 Although the Tenant
indicated that there were some maintenance issues, he was not prepared to provide
evidence with regards to these issues at the hearing.  I advised the Tenant
that he could still raise such issues by way of a Tenant application of his own
and proceeded to determine this application.
Section 83
13.  
The Tenant is a
self-employed mover and resides by himself and his two cats.  He indicates that
it would be difficult to find a new place and would need about 60 days for him
to move out.
14.  
On the other hand, the
Landlords have not received any income from the Radlett property for one year
while they have a mortgage and other expenses to pay.  The arrears owing are
significant.
15.  
The Tenant has been aware of
the Landlords’ efforts to evict him for some time and has had sufficient notice
to find a new place.  
16.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction, pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before May 11,
2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlords $21,049.14*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to April 30, 2018.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $51.59 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
May 1, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before May 11, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from May 12,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before May 11, 2018, then starting May 12, 2018, the Landlords may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlords, on or after May 12, 2018.
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlords or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $22,144.23 if the payment is made on or before May 4, 2018, or
ii)       $23,713.46 if the payment is made on or before May 11, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after May 12, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlords.
