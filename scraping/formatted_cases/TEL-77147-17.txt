Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-77147-17
 










 
 
 

M.M.L.I.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict K.B.
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on March 8, 2017.
 
The Landlord’s representative, R.A., the property manager, L.U.,
and the resident manager, B.N., attended the hearing. The Tenant also attended
the hearing. 
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent he was required to pay for the period from
January 1, 2017 to March 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination effective January 23, 2017.
2.     
The arrears of rent owing for the
period ending March 31, 2017, total $976.15.
3.     
The Landlord incurred costs as a
result of filing the application in the amount of $170.00 and is entitled to
reimbursement for those costs. 
4.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $975.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2017
to January 23, 2017, in the amount of$0.92.
6.      The
Tenant paid $1,348.93 after the application was filed.
7.      At
the hearing, the Tenant raised issues pursuant to subsection 82(1) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 20016 (the ‘Act’). The Tenant says he has withheld the rent
for march 2017 because the Landlord wrongfully had his car towed and he had to
pay $235.00 to retrieve the car. 
8.      For
the reasons that follow, I am satisfied that the Tenant’s s.82 issues must be
dismissed. 
9.      First,
although the Tenant alleges that he is withholding the rent for March, in
actual fact, he fell into arrears two months prior and provided no explanation
for those arrears. The Tenant lives alone in the rental unit, has a monthly
income of $3,000.00 and can easily afford the monthly rent of $957.65. 
10.   In
addition, the Tenant admits that the car in question does not have license
plates and was not parked in the Landlord’s regular parking lot. The Tenant
also admits that he did not have a parking agreement with the Landlord for this
car, and he admits that received the notice that Landlord placed on his car
advising him that the car would be towed if the Tenant failed to register the
vehicle and obtain a parking agreement. 
11.   Based
on the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the Landlord had a positive
obligation to remove the unlicensed vehicle from the property, the Landlord
properly notified the Tenant of the situation, and then was fully justified in
having the vehicle removed when the Tenant failed to respond accordingly.  The
Landlord should not be held financially responsible for the Tenant’s failure to
resolve the situation. As a result, the Tenant’s section 82 issues are
dismissed. 
12.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It
is ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before March 21, 2017.
2.      As
of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation
the Landlord is entitled to by $704.06*.
3.      However,
the Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the
Landlord owes the Tenant:
$31.02 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting March 11, 2017
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit, and
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
4.      The
Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as
a result of this order.
5.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before March 21, 2017, then starting March 22,
2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
6.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 22, 2017.
7.      If,
on or before March 21, 2017, the Tenant pays the amount of $1,166.15** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
8.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after March 22, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
