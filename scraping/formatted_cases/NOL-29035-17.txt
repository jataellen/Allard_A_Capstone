Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-29035-17
 











 
 
 

[NUMBERED COMPANY] (the 'Landlord') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict J. C. (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
L1 application
 
And
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant has been persistently late
in paying the rent. L2 application
 
This combined application was heard in Sudbury on
October 3, 2017.
 
The Landlord’s agent J. K. and the
Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
            L1 application
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from August 1, 2017 to
October 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective August 26, 2017.
2.     
The Tenant testified at the
hearing that the Tenant is not a position to pay any rent arrears and the
monthly rent. The Tenant testified that he is waiting for some money to come
from the insurance company. The Tenant was not sure how much money the
insurance company is going to pay him and when. There was no definite answer
from the Tenant.
3.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
L2 application
4.      I am satisfied with this evidence and the Tenant is persistently
late paying the rent.
5.      I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance
with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction
subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection
83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
            L1 application
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before October
16, 2017.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $1,464.59*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to October 5, 2017.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $22.19 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
October 6, 2017 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before October 16, 2017, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
October 17, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before October 16, 2017, then starting October 17, 2017, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after October 17, 2017.
8.     
If, on or before October 16,
2017, the Tenant pays the amount of $2,215.00** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after October 17, 2017 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
L2 application
10.   If the Tenant voids the part of this order relating to the L1
application as set out in paragraphs 8 above, the Tenant shall pay the monthly
rent on or before 1st day of each month, starting November 1, 2017
and continuing up to and including October 1, 2018.
11.   If the Tenant fails to make any of the payments
as set out in paragraphs 10 above, the Landlord may apply under section 78 of
the Act, within 30 days of the breach, without notice to the Tenant, for
an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant.
