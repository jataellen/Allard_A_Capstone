K.H.T.
and K.D. (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict A.P. and R.R. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent
that the Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard in Lindsay on April 9, 2018.
 
The Landlords and the Tenants attended the hearing.  
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The
Tenants stated that they did not agree with the personal Landlord’s, who is a
director of the company Landlord, listed amount outstanding as noted in the
Update Sheet provided by the individual Landlord.  The first-named Tenant said
that they always paid in cash and never received receipts from the Landlord. 
The Tenants also stated that they had no evidence to support their claim.
2.     The
Landlord presented a text message dated September 18, 2017, from the
first-named Tenant stating she knew they were in arrears and they were
attempting to utilize their supports in order to get back on track.  
3.     The
Tenants further stated that there have been maintenance issues at the rental
unit and the Landlord and his brother, who also deals with the unit, said there
would be no maintenance done on the unit until the rent is paid.  
4.     The
Landlord acknowledged the first-named Tenant had told him about an issue with
the toilet about a month ago, but claims the Landlord cannot afford to fix it. 
Subsection 20(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’)
states, 
A
landlord is responsible for providing and maintaining a residential complex,
including the rental units in it, in a good state of repair and fit for
habitation and for complying with health, safety, housing and maintenance
standards.
5.     I
reminded the Landlord of this obligation under the Act.
6.     The
Tenants also said the Landlord’s brother attended the rental unit and forced
the second-named Tenant into his truck to drive him to collect the rent.  It is
clear by the second-named Tenant’s testimony he felt uncomfortable at the very
least during this situation.
7.     As
I said at the hearing when questioned by the Landlord of why I am listening to
such issues when the application before the Board is for non-payment of rent,
the Tenants have an opportunity to bring forward section 82 issues and the
Board must determine whether the Landlords are in serious breach of its
obligations.  If it is deemed that the Landlords are in serious breach the
Landlords’ application would be dismissed outright pursuant to section
83(3)(a).
8.     Regarding
section 82, when a landlord brings forward an application for non-payment of
rent “the Board shall permit the tenant to raise any issue that could be the
subject of an application made by the tenant under this Act.”
9.     As
the Tenants were not prepared to bring forward any issues under section 82 of
the Act, no maintenance, substantial interference, or harassment concerns were
heard on their merits at this time.
10.  The
Tenants requested a repayment plan for the total owed.  Their preferred
repayment plan is $300.00 a month along with the monthly rent.  In the
alternative, they requested to pay $500.00 a month with the monthly rent.
11.  The
Landlord requested an order with standard terms allowing the Tenants to pay the
full amount within eleven days of when the order is written.
12.  When
determining whether to grant the repayment plan, I have taken into
consideration the positions of both parties.  
13.  The
Landlord stated it cannot financially support a repayment plan; however, failed
to provide evidence to substantiate this claim.
14.  The
Tenants stated they are on a basic income pilot and the second-named Tenant
works for the Boys and Girls Club in Lindsay.  The first-named Tenant is still
in school but will be finished in June 2018 with a designation as a Personal
Support Worker.  She went to school on a government grant.  The Tenants have
also made a substantial payment of $5,000.00 since the application was filed.
15.  Given all
of the above, I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction
subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection
83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.  The Tenants are granted a repayment plan of
$500.00 a month plus their monthly rent.
16.  This
order contains all of the reasons for my decision within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.  
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $4,090.00 for arrears of rent to April 30,
2018 and costs.
2.     The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord the amount above in paragraph 1 in accordance
with the following schedule:
a)    $500.00
on or before May 1, 2018;
b)    $500.00
on or before June 1, 2018;
c)    $500.00
on or before July 1, 2018;
d)    $500.00
on or before August 1, 2018;
e)    $500.00
on or before September 1, 2018;
f)     $500.00
on or before October 1, 2018;
g)    $500.00
on or before November 1, 2018;
h)    $500.00
on or before December 1, 2018; and
i)     $90.00
on or before January 1, 2019.
3.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord the monthly rent on or before the first
day of each month beginning May 1, 2018 until January 1, 2019.
4.     If
the Tenants fail to make any one of the payments in accordance with this order,
the outstanding balance of any arrears of rent and costs to be paid by the
Tenants to the Landlord pursuant to paragraph 1 of this order shall become
immediately due and owing and the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenants,
apply to the Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating
the tenancy and evicting the Tenants and requiring that the Tenants pay any new
arrears, NSF fees and related charges that became owing after April 30, 2018.
