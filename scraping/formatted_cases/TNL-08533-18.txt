Order under Section
21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-08533-18-RV
 
 
 
Review Order
 
OI
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict CVB
and CB (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This
application was resolved by order TNL-08533-18 issued on October 11, 2018.
 
On November 8, 2018, the Tenants requested a review of the order.
 
A preliminary review of the review request was completed without a
hearing.
 
Determinations:
   
1.      On
the basis of the submissions made in the request, I am not satisfied that there
is a serious error in the order or that a serious error occurred in the
proceedings.
 
2.      The
Tenants submit that the Member erred in refusing their adjournment request.
The Board will not interfere with the proper exercise of discretion by a Member
(Guideline 8 of the Landlord and Tenant Board Interpretation Guidelines). 
The Member gave detailed reasons for denying the adjournment request and the
Member’s exercise of discretion (under section 21 of the Statutory Powers
Procedures Act) is reasonable and consistent with Guideline 1 of the Landlord
and Tenant Board Interpretation Guidelines.
 
3.      The
Tenants further submit that CB does not reside in the unit.  The Member
declined to deal with the issue because there was no evidence before her on
that issue. The review process is not intended for parties to litigate issues
that could have been determined at the hearing had the parties been prepared.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
request to review order TNL-08533-18 issued on October 11, 2018, is denied. The order is confirmed and remains unchanged.
