Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: SWL-16478-18
NAR (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict JN and AD (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.  The application is amended to remove AD, who the parties
agree is not a tenant.  
 
This application was heard in Waterloo on
June 25, 2018.  The Landlord’s Legal Representative, GKL, attended the
hearing.  The Tenant, JN, also attended the hearing.  The Tenant declined the
opportunity to speak with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing. 
 
The issue before me was the amount of
arrears owing.  I have reviewed all of the available evidence, including the
receipts and documents provided by the Tenant and the ledger details,
handwritten notes and update form provided by the Landlord at the hearing.  
 
The Tenant requested that I admit documents
after this hearing began which were not served on the Landlord prior to the
hearing.  I excluded these documents from consideration as there was no reason
the documents could not have been provided to the Landlord’s Legal
Representative at the beginning of the day.  The Tenant’s election to bring up
unmentioned documents and evidence in the midst of a hearing was unnecessary. 
The parties were cautioned at the beginning of the hearing date that it is
necessary to serve any evidence on which they intend to rely on the other side
before the commencement of the hearing.  The Tenant’s election not to do so
resulted in the evidence being excluded from consideration.  I require
documentation to be served before a hearing begins to allow the parties to know
the case they must meet and to prepare any necessary reply evidence.  
 
Having considered all properly exchanged
evidence, I find that on the date of the hearing the Tenant owed $1,561.90 in
arrears as well as the costs of filing the application.  This differs somewhat
from the $1,579.10 claimed by the Landlord and is based on a combination of the
evidence before me and the Board’s order (SWL-02708-17-AM) issued June 21,
2018.  That order was not reviewed or otherwise challenged.  The order
determined that the Tenant owed $882.80 to the end of June 2017.  
 
The Landlord’s ledger shows that the
Tenant’s payment of $900.00 was processed on June 27, 2018.  In my view, this
left a credit balance of $17.20 as of July 1, 2017.  The following charges and
payments are described in the evidence before me:

Balance as of the date of the hearing: $1,561.90.

 
I have not made any finding as to when the
payments were received as this made no difference to the calculation of
arrears.  The dates the payments were processed are reflected in the Landlord’s
ledger in all months but March and June 2018.  March’s payment is reflected in
the Tenant’s receipt.  In the month of June there was no evidence of any
payment.  The payments received were applied to the rent owing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant did not pay the
total rent they were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2017 to June
30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective April 25, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
3.     
The monthly rent is $973.18.
4.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $35.06 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by
the Landlord.
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from February 1, 2018 to April 25, 2018.
6.     
The Tenant paid $1,774.00
after the application was filed.
7.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before August
5, 2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $2,316.02*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to July 25, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $31.95 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting July 26, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before August 5, 2018, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
August 6, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before August 5, 2018, then starting August 6, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after August 6, 2018.
8.     
If the Tenants wish to void
this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust:
i)        $2,725.08 if the payment is made on or before July 31, 2018, or
ii)       $3,698.26 if the payment is made on or before August 5, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after August 6,
2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
