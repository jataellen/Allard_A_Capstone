Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-02487-18
 










 

RG
and MG (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict LM (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This
application was heard in Mississauga on April 25, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord, MG,  and the Landlord's Legal Representative, HT,
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from January 20, 2018 to May 19, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective February 27, 2018.
2.     The
Tenant paid $1,550.00 after the application was filed.
3.     I have
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1)
of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before May 8, 2018.
2.     The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $5,067.24*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to April 27, 2018.
3.     The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $83.84 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting April 28, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.     The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.     If the
Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before May 8,
2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from May 9, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     If the unit
is not vacated on or before May 8, 2018, then starting May 9, 2018, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after May 9, 2018.
8.     If, on or
before May 8, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $7,275.00** to the Landlords
or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that
the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit. 
If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this
order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
9.     The Tenant
may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside
this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after
May 9, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords.
The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
