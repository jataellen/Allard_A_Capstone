Order under Section 21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-76211-16-RV
 










 
 

Review Order
Landlord’s
L1 application.
V.K. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict D.V.K. and
S.K. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe.
 
Landlord’s
L2 application.
The
'Landlord' also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
'Tenants' because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they
permitted in the residential complex have substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or
another tenant. 
 
These
applications were resolved by order TEL-76211-16 issued on February 22, 2017.
 
On March
2, 2017, the Tenants requested a review of the order.
 
The
request was heard in Toronto on March 21, 2017.
 
The
Landlord’s agent S.R. and the Tenants S.K. attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      As
the Tenants had a death in family the Tenants were unable to attend the first
hearing. As such the review was granted and the hearing continued.  
2.      With
respect to the Landlord’s L1 application, the
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from October 2, 2016 to April 1, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective December 13, 2016.
3.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,460.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
4.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from September 3,
2016 to December 13, 2016.
5.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
6.      With
respect to the Landlord’s L2 application, as this
portion of the application had all ready been found to be without merit in the
first hearing, this portion of the application was dismissed.
7.      The
reasons contained in this order constitute all of the reasons used in making my
decision. 
It
is ordered that:
 
1.      Order
TEL-76211-16 issued on February 22, 2017 is cancelled and replaced by the
following: Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out
of the rental unit on or before April 4, 2017.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $6,299.76*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to March 24, 2017, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $48.00 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting March 25, 2017 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $170.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 4, 2017, then starting April 5,
2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
6.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 5, 2017.
7.      If
the Tenants wish to void this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $8,930.00 if the payment is made on or before April 1, 2017, or
ii)       $10,390.00 if the payment is made on or before April 4, 2017**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after April 5, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
