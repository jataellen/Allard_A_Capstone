Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-89270-18
 











 
 
 

T. G. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict T. M. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Cobourg on May 22, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent he was required to pay for the period from October 1, 2017 to May
31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective February 19, 2018.
2.    
When asked if she agreed
with the amount outstanding on the Landlord’s update sheet provided at the
commencement of the hearing, the Tenant stated she did not agree, but could not
give a definitive amount she did owe.  The Tenant said that she used to have
her Ontario Disability Support Program payments were direct to the Landlord
until sometime last year.  She then paid the Landlord cash every month and said
it would be given hand to hand.
3.    
The Tenant further stated
that she had her brother give the money to the Landlord.  Her brother was at
the Board and the Tenant intended to use him as a witness; however, changed her
mind when it was time to bring him into the room saying her brother can be
aggressive.  No further evidence was provided by the Tenant regarding alleged
payments to the Landlord.
4.    
The Landlord submitted
copies of receipts where he documented payments and non-payments each month
from the Tenant.  He said the Tenant would give him excuses for not paying and
when he attended her unit she would not answer the door to speak to him.  The
Landlord tried to help the Tenant out, but now feels he is being taken
advantage of in this situation.  
5.    
The Tenant then agreed to
the amount the Landlord has claimed and said that it is obvious her brother has
not been making the payments as he said he was.
6.    
Based on the evidence before
the Board, I am satisfied the amount claimed by the Landlord is accurate.
7.    
The Tenant requested a
repayment plan of $250.00 a month plus the monthly rent.  This would take the
Tenant 16 months to bring her balance to zero.  The Landlord requested an order
with standard terms to pay the amount outstanding within eleven days of when
the order is written.  The Tenant then said she could pay $300.00 a month,
which would take 13 months to pay off the balance.  The Landlord did not agree.
8.    
In this situation, the
Tenant has not persuaded me that a repayment plan is viable.  She failed to
prove that she could sustain any agreement and for this reason, no repayment
plan is granted.
9.    
The Tenant wanted a few
months to move because it is difficult to find a new rental unit.  She has a 16
year old child living with her as well.  The Landlord said he was agreeable to
a delay of 30 days if I were to decide to delay, but would prefer the standard
11 days.  I am not satisfied a delay is warranted in this case and an order
with standard terms will issue.
10.  The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $695.00
from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
11.  Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenant for the period from January 1, 2018 to February 19, 2018.
12.  The Tenant paid $1,390.00 after the application
was filed.
13.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
14.  
This order contains all of
the reasons for the decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before June 8,
2018.
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $2,816.72*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to May 28, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $22.85 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
May 29, 2018 to the date he moves out of the unit.
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 8, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June 9,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 8, 2018, then starting June 9, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 9, 2018.
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, he must pay to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust:
i)       $3,810.00 if the payment is made on or before May 31, 2018, or
ii)      $4,505.00 if the payment is made on or before June 8, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after June 9, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
