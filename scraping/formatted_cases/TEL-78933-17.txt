Order
under Section 21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-78933-17-RV
 
 
 
Review Order
 
VV and ST
(the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict MW
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was resolved by order TEL-78933-17 issued on May 3, 2017.
 
On
June 1, 2017, the Tenant requested a review of the order.
 
A
preliminary review of the review request was completed without a hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     On
the basis of the submissions made in the request, I am not satisfied that there
is a serious error in the order or that a serious error occurred in the
proceedings or that the Tenant was not reasonably able to participate. I say
this for the following reasons. 
2.     The
Tenant’s request for review alleges she was not reasonably able to participate
in the hearing because the Landlords did not serve her with the notice of
hearing. 
3.     Landlords
no longer serve tenants applications and notices of hearing; the Board does.
The Board’s records indicate on April 3, 2017 the Board mailed notice of
hearing and the application to the Tenant. That mail has not been returned to
the Board by Canada Post.
4.     As
a result, I can only assume the Tenant is alleging she was not reasonably able
to participate because she did not get the Board’s mail. 
5.     The
problem with the Tenant’s assertion in this regard is that the contents of the
review request and the Board’s file support the conclusion that the Tenant is
not credible. 
6.     The
rental unit is a single family home and the monthly rent is $2,100.00. At the
time the application was heard the arrears owing totalled $8,400.00 and nothing
had been paid since January 1, 2017. 
7.     The
review says the Tenant found out the rent was not being paid in April of 2017
when she was released from the hospital and she spoke to the Landlords about
purchasing the home. She then got approval for financing of $650,000 and “was
waiting for approval for the $250,000”. In my common sense view it seems
unlikely that someone capable of obtaining that much financing would fall into
arrears of rent and not know that was happening. 
8.     The
review request goes on to say the Tenant was evicted by the Sheriff the day she
filed the review request with the Board “and I never got served any legal
papers”. 
9.     In
addition to the notice of hearing not being returned to the Board by Canada
Post, our records indicate the order was also not returned by Canada Post. The
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) also serves tenants with writs of possession
well in advance of the actual eviction date. Given that all of these documents
appear to have been properly served on the rental unit which is a single family
home, the Tenant’s statement that she has never received anything at all seems implausible. 

10.  Given all
of the above, I am not satisfied that there is a serious error in the order or
that a serious error occurred in the proceedings or that the Tenant was not
reasonably able to participate.
It
is ordered that:
 
1.      The
request to review order TEL-78933-17 issued on May 3, 2017 is denied. The order
is confirmed and remains unchanged.
