Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-80248-17
 










 
 
 

Y.C.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict D.M.
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (the
‘L1 application’) and because the Landlord requires possession of the
rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation (the ‘L2 application’).
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on June 2, 2017.
 
Only the Landlord and the Landlord’s representative,A.G., attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
The L2 Application 
 
1.      The
Landlord says that his in-laws are downsizing; they are selling their own
property and would like to move into the rental unit which is a basement
apartment. 
2.      The
Landlord’s mother-in-law testified at the hearing that, as she and her partner
are of retirement age, they would like to get rid of their mortgage debt and
pay a lower amount of rent to their son-in-law. She says that she plans to do
some minor renovations on her current property, and then list the property for
sale in mid-June. The Landlord’s mother-in-law provided the Board with a sworn
affidavit which confirms her verbal testimony. 
3.      Based on
the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the Landlord’s in-laws genuinely
and in good faith require the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation pursuant to subsection 48(1)(c) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 20016 (the ‘Act’). 
4.      As
the date of termination on the notice is June 30, 2017, the tenancy will
terminate on that date. 
 
The L1
Application 
5.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent he was required to pay for the period from
March 1, 2017 to June 30, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a
Notice of Termination effective May 9, 2017.
6.      The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending June 30, 2017, total $3,800.00.
7.      The
Landlord incurred costs as a result of filing the application in the amount of
$190.00 and is entitled to reimbursement for those costs. 
8.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $950.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
9.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from March 31, 2014
to May 9, 2017, in the amount of $50.05.
10.   As
mentioned above, the date of termination on the N12 is June 30, 2017. Although
the Landlord is seeking a “standard 11 day order” for the L1 application, this
would result in a different termination date and could lead to confusion for
the parties. 
11.   As
a result, I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance
with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until
June 30, 2017, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act, in order to avoid
any confusion regarding precisely when this tenancy has terminated.  
It
is ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before June 30, 2017.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,055.46*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to June 15, 2017, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $31.23 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting June 16, 2017 to the date he moves out of the unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June
26, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from June 27, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before June 30, 2017, then starting July 1, 2017,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 1, 2017.
8.      If,
on or before June 30, 2017, the Tenant pays the amount of $3,990.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after July 1, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
