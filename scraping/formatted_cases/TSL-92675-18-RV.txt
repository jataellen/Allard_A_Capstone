Order under Section 21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-92675-18-RV










 
 

Review Order
 
S.M
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict  and J.J
(the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This
application was resolved by order TSL-92675-18 issued on March 1, 2018.
 
On
March 9, 2018, the Tenants requested a review of the order, and that the order
be stayed until the request for review is resolved.
 
On
March 12, 2018 order TSL-92675-18-RV-IN was issued, staying order TSL-92675-18
issued on March 1, 2018.
 
The
request was heard in Toronto on April 5, 2018.
 
The
Landlord’s legal representative, D.C, and the Tenant J.J, on behalf of both
Tenants, attended the hearing.
            
Determinations:
 
Request
for Review
1.      The
Tenant testified that she had mistaken the date on the Notice of Hearing and
had attended at the Board on February 28, 2018 instead of the date of hearing
on February 26, 2018.  She also testified that she had sought advice from Board
staff on that date and was told to wait for the Board order to issue and then
come to the Board to seek advice from Tenant Duty Counsel about her options and
whether to file a review.  She testified that she attended again at the Board
on March 9, 2018 and filed her request for review.  
2.      The
Landlord’s representative opposed the request for review.  He submitted that
the Board should see the Tenant’s failure to attend as a disregard for the
Board’s proceedings.  He referenced two cases as examples where the Board had
refused requests for review in similar circumstances.  
3.      I
find that the cases referred to by the Landlord are distinguishable from the
case at hand.  I accept the Tenant’s testimony that she attended the Board on
February 28, 2018 and that her failure to attend on February 26, 2018 was by
inadvertence and not disregard for the Board’s process.  The
case King-Winton v. Doverhold Investments, 2008 CanLII 60708 para. 3 (ON
SCDC), encourages the Board to look at the issue of being reasonably able to
participate broadly.  On this basis, the request for review is granted.
 
Application
for Arrears of Rent
4.      The
Tenant indicated that she has issues of lack of maintenance and disrepair to
raise in relation to the application.  It was explained that if she did not
have all the necessary evidence to proceed with making her case for maintenance
and disrepair, that she might prefer to raise the issues in a tenant
application.  The hearing was stood down to give her the opportunity to
consider her options and to show the evidence she had brought to the Landlord’s
representative.  
5.      The
Tenant used the break to consult again with Tenant Duty Counsel and advised
that she would bring a Tenant’s application and would not raise the issues
regarding section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) in the
current application.  
6.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from December 1, 2017 to April 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective February 2, 2018.
7.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,600.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
8.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from March 20, 2017
to February 2, 2018.
9.      The
Tenant agreed that $8,000.00 is owing in arrears of rent to April 30, 2018. 
The Tenant acknowledges that the application filing fee will be paid by the
Tenant.  The Tenant testified that the only way she could pay off the arrears
is through a payment plan, paying current rent monthly with an additional
$500.00 a month towards the arrears on the 22nd day of each month.  
10.   The
Landlord opposed the payment plan on the basis that it would take 16 months to
pay off the arrears at that rate.
11.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Act.  I find that the payment plan proposed by the
Tenant is unreasonable in the length of time it would take to pay off the
arrears.  The Tenant testified that she receives social assistance and the
federal child tax credit for her family.  She is a lone parent with three
children.  The Tenant provided no other information concerning her ability to pay
her monthly rent and address the significant arrears.  I do not see that this
is a sustainable tenancy in the circumstances and considering both the
prejudice to the Landlord and to the Tenant, find that it would not be unfair
to postpone the eviction until April 30, 2018 pursuant to subsection
83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
request to review is granted and Order TSL-92675-18 issued on March 1, 2018 is
cancelled and replaced by the following: 
2.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before April 30, 2018.
3.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $5,151.56*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to April 9, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $52.60 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting April 10, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
5.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 30, 2018, then starting May 1, 2018,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 1, 2018.
8.      If,
on or before April 30, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $8,175.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after May 1, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
