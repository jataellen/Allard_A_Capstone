Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-06025-18

YL
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict JM
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes
(‘L1 application’).
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the
Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with
the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord
or another tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
These
applications were heard together in Newmarket on July 23, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord’s legal representative, JS attended the
hearing.  There was no record before me of a request to adjourn and I was
satisfied that the parties had proper notice of the hearing.  After waiting
more than 30 minutes, I proceeded to determine the applications on the basis of
the materials before me and submissions from the Landlord.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 Application
 
1.     The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from April 1, 2018 to July 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective June 19, 2018.
2.     The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,600.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
3.     Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 1, 2017 to
June 19, 2018.
4.     No
circumstances were disclosed to me to support relief from eviction in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, (2006)
(the ‘Act’) in relation to the L1 application.
L2
Application
5.      The
tenancy agreement, as amended by agreement between the parties, provides that
the Tenant shall pay 50% of the electricity, gas, and water bills.  The Tenant
has substantially interfered with the Landlord’s lawful right or interest by
failing to pay their share of the utility bills.
 
6.      The
Landlord has paid the Tenant’s share of the utility bills in the amount of
$1,769.12 to the hearing date.
 
7.      I have
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Act, and find that, if the Tenant voids the part of this order
relating to eviction for non-payment of rent, it would not be unfair to grant
relief from eviction in connection with the L2 application pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act if the Tenant pays the amount the Tenant owes to
the Landlord for unpaid utility bills as set out in this order.
It is ordered that:
 
L1 application
 
1.     Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before August 6, 2018.
2.     The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4,515.35*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to July 26, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $52.60 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting July 27, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.     The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.     If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before August
6, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from August 7, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     If
the unit is not vacated on or before August 6, 2018, then starting August 7,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after August 7, 2018.
8.     If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)       $6,575.00 if the payment is made on or before July 31, 2018, or
ii)      $8,175.00 if the payment is made on or before August 6, 2018**.
This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could
remain in the unit, subject to the conditions set out below. If the Tenant
does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order relating to non-payment of rent if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after August 7, 2018 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to
make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
L2
Application
10.   If
the Tenant voids the Order for termination as set out in paragraph 8 above, the
tenancy shall continue provided the Tenant pays to the Landlord the full amount
owing to the Landlord for electricity, water and gas bills on or before the 10th
day of August, 2018.
 
11.   If the
Tenant fails to make the payment under paragraph 10, above, the Landlord may
apply under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’), within 30 days of the breach, without notice to the Tenant, for an
order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant.
