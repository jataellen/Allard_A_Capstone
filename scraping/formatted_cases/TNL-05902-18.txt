Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-05902-18











 

EPI (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict MF (the 'Tenant') because she has been persistently late
in paying her rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on July 26,
2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, SH
and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
This is a month to month
tenancy and the rent is due on the first day of each month.
2.     
Initially the Tenant
disputed that she paid the rent late. When questioned what payments in the
Landlord’s ledger she disputes, she indicated that she did not bring her
receipts to the hearing. Later, the Tenant agreed that she has been
persistently late in paying the rent when due.
3.     
There was no dispute that
the monthly rent is $1,165.72. 
 
4.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,169.02 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
 
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.
6.     
The Tenant has lived in the
unit for about two years. She lives in the unit with her two children, ages 2
and 7.
7.     
The Tenant receives monthly
benefits from Ontario Works in the amount of $1,145.00; and monthly child tax
credit of $1,200.00. The Tenant has a total income of $2,345.00.
8.     
The Tenant says that she has
been late paying the rent in the last few months because she is a single mother
and used the money for her children and other expenses. She also claimed that
she was not getting her full child tax credit, but did not provide any
documentary evidence to support her position. 
9.     
The Tenant acknowledged that
she is in arrears of rent and has not paid the rent in full for June and July
2018. The Tenant says that she had important things to do and spent the money
on her children.
10.  
The Landlord submitted that
the Tenant has made little effort to pay the rent on time and is in arrears of
rent, despite having a monthly income of $2,345.00. 
11.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. I considered that
the Tenant appears to have an income that would allow her to pay the rent on
time but she has failed to do so. This leads me to conclude that the Tenant is
either unwilling or unable to pay the rent when due. 
12.  
If the Tenant was not in
arrears of rent, I would have considered issuing a conditional order that she
pay the rent when due. However, the Tenant indicated that she could not pay the
arrears for another 30 days and would need the help of family to do so. It
seems to me that the Tenant cannot sustain this tenancy. 
13.  
The Tenant asked for three
months to move out of the unit. The Landlord submitted that three months is too
long and requested that the Tenant move out within eleven days.
14.  
I considered that this is
not a lengthy tenancy and the Tenant is in arrears of rent and a  delay of
three months would more likely than not mean the Tenant will fall further into
arrears. However, I also considered the Tenant’s family situation, and will
give the Tenant a few additional days to move out of the unit.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated, as of August 13, 2018. The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before August 13, 2018.
2.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before August 13, 2018, then starting August 14, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
3.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after August 14, 2018.
4.     
As of the date of this
order, the amount the Landlord is holding for the rent deposit and the interest
owing on the deposit exceeds the amount the Tenant owes for compensation by
$29.56.
5.     
The Landlord is authorized
to offset from the amount the Landlord owes the Tenant the following amounts:
$38.33 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from July 31, 2018  to
the date the Tenant  moves out of the unit; and $190.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
6.     
The Landlord may collect
from the Tenant any amounts that become owing as a result of this order.
7.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing on or before August 13, 2018, she will start
to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from August 14, 2018
at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
