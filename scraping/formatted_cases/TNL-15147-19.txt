Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-15147-19
 











 
 

 (TCHC )(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict AW (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application came before the Board in Toronto on
May 30, 2019 and was heard on October 31, 2019.
 
At the May 30, 2019 hearing, an interim order was
issued that the Tenant pay the rent to the Board in trust until the matter is
resolved by the Board.
 
The Landlord’s representative, NJ
and the Tenant attended the October 2019 hearing. 
 
The Landlord called as a witness: (JL)
(superintendent). 
 
The Tenant raised issues pursuant to section 82 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').
 
Determinations:
 
Section 82 issue: Substantial
Interference with Reasonable Enjoyment
 
1.     
The issue to be determined
by the Board is whether the Landlord substantially interfered with the Tenant’s
reasonable enjoyment of the unit by not dealing with the Tenant’s complaints
that the tenant in another apartment is smoking marijuana and the smoke is
getting inside the Tenant’s unit through the vents.
2.     
It was the evidence of the
Tenant that on December 2, 2018 the tenant in another apartment told the Tenant
that he smokes marijuana. The Tenant told the tenant in the other apartment that
he finds the smell of marijuana skunky and he is sensitive to it and has his
own allergies. The tenant in the other apartment told the Tenant that he would
go downstairs and smoke. The Tenant states that from afternoon to night he
would smell the marijuana smoke in between 40 minute breaks. 
3.     
On December 3, 2018, the
Tenant sent an email to the Landlord’s Operating Unit Manager, CF asking that
TCHC apartments be declared a marijuana free environment. The Tenant also
complained about the marijuana smoke from the other apartment.
4.     
On December 13, 2018, the
Landlord responded to the Tenant and outlined the policy on smoking in the
unit. On January 4, 2019 the Landlord amongst other things, advised the Tenant
to call the CSU which is available 24 hours a day/7 days a week and to document
the occurrences. 
5.     
The Tenant submitted into
evidence the emails he sent to the Landlord with the dates that he was smelling
marijuana smoke in his unit and a complaint about pounding on a drum. The
Tenant finds the stench unbearable and because of the smell, he says that his unit
is not fit for habitation. As a result, on some occasions he had to stay with
friends. The Tenant says that he wants the tenant in the other apartment to
move out and once the Tenant has his unit back, he will start to pay the rent. 
6.     
The Tenant stated that the
smoke is coming into unit from the vent in the kitchen and as a result he
cannot enter his kitchen to prepare meals. As a result, his health has been
affected. The Tenant did not provide any medical evidence from his doctors that
his health has been affected by marijuana smoke. 
7.     
The Tenant wanted to submit into
evidence a recording of another tenant, who he says was his witness to the
smell of marijuana. The Landlord objected to this recording as the witness was
not present to be cross-examined. 
8.     
The Board did not accept the
Tenant’s recording as evidence, as it would have been procedurally unfair to
the Landlord to do so, since the person on the recording was not at the hearing
to be cross examined. The Tenant could have asked this person to attend the
hearing as a witness. 
9.     
It was the evidence of the
Landlord’s superintendent, JL that he is familiar with the Tenant and the
tenant in the other apartment. JL says that on March 14, 2019 he learned about
the Tenant’s complaint about the smell of smoke. On March 15, 2019 he attended
at the Tenant’s unit to check the ventilation and found the vents in the
bathroom and the kitchen to be in working order.   
10.  
JL testified that the Tenant
continued to complain about the marijuana smell and from March 14, 2019, on a
daily basis he inspected the 3rd floor. He stated that he received
no other complaints about the smell of smoke from other tenants. They also
inspected the other apartment and there was no smell of marijuana. The vents in
the other apartment were inspected and there were no issue with the air flow. 
11.  
JL testified that there was a
recent inspection on October 25, 2019 of the Tenant’s unit and the other
apartment and the ventilation was in working order in both units. 
12.  
During cross examination, JL
testified that when he was in the Tenant’s unit on March15 he did not smell any
marijuana. After he left the Tenant’s unit, he returned, after the Tenant said
he was smelling marijuana. JL stated that when he returned to the unit, he did
not smell any marijuana. He also knocked on the other apartment’s door but
there was no answer. 
13.  
JL also stated that once a
day, from March 14, 2019 he would do random checks on the 3rd floor
during different times of the day. He has never smelled marijuana on the 3rd
floor. 
14.  
Based on the evidence
adduced at the hearing, I do not find that the Landlord has substantially
interfered with the Tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of the unit by failing to
address the Tenant’s complaints about the smell of marijuana in the unit. The
evidence before me indicates that the Landlord investigated the Tenant’s
complaints. I accepted the evidence of JL that he has been doing daily checks
on the 3rd floor and has not smelled marijuana. I would expect that
if the smell was unbearable as the Tenant claimed, that JL would have smelled
it in the hallway. 
15.  
I also do not find that the
Tenant provided sufficient evidence to establish that the unit is uninhabitable;
or that there is the smell of marijuana in the unit. The Tenant sends the
email(s) to the Landlord usually a day or more after experiencing the alleged
marijuana smell. The Tenant was told to call the 24 hour line, and he should
have done so when he smelled the marijuana so that a Special Constable could
attend the unit. Or the Tenant could have also contacted JL so that JL could
attend the unit immediately.  
16.  
The Tenant did not provide sufficient
evidence that the Landlord failed to address his complaint about the drum
pounding. The Tenant only submitted into evidence one instance on January 20,
2019 of hearing a drum pounding. 
17.  
Based on the above, the
Tenant’s claim pursuant to section 82 of the Act is dismissed.
 
L1 arrears of rent:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from February 1, 2019
to October 31, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective March 1, 2019.
2.     
The monthly rent as of the
date of the hearing is $713.00. 
3.     
The Tenant has paid
$3,588.00 to the Board in trust since the application was filed. **
4.     
The Tenant takes the
position that he does not owe the rent because his unit is not habitable. 
5.     
The Tenant’s claim under
section 82 has been dismissed. 
6.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. I say this
because the Tenant has been withholding the rent and should have the funds to
void the order.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before February
11, 2020.The amount of $3,588.00 plus accrued interest shall be paid out to the
Landlord.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $5,024.28*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to January 31, 2020.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $23.44 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
February 1, 2020 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 11, 2020, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
February 12, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 11, 2020, then starting February 12, 2020, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 12, 2020.
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $5,143.00 if the payment is made on or before January 31, 2020, or
ii)       $5,856.00 if the payment is made on or before February 11, 2020**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after February 12, 2020 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
10.  
The Board shall pay to the
Landlord the amount of $3,588.00 together with any accrued interest. **
