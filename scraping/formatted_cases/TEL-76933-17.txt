Order under Sections 69 and 89
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-76933-17
 










 
 
 

A.W.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict J.S., C.W.
and E.C. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe (the ‘L1 application’). The Landlord also claimed
administration charges related to NSF cheques.
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants
because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in
the residential complex have wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the
premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenants to
compensate the Landlord for the damage (the ‘L2/N5 Damage Claim’).
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy because the Tenants,
another occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the
residential complex have substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant (the ‘N5
Interference Claim’).
 
This
application was heard in Lindsay on March 28, 2017.
 
The following people attended the hearing: 
•        
The Landlord
•        
The Landlord’s witness, R.G.;
•        
The Landlord’s witness, M.S.; 
•        
The first-named Tenant, ‘CW’; 
•        
The third-named Tenant, ‘JS’; and 
•        
The Tenants’ witness, H.R.. 
 
 
 
Preliminary Issues:
 
The Tenants’ Concerns
 
1.    This
matter was previously adjourned on February 28, 2017, in order to give the
Tenants an opportunity to file their own application. 
2.    The
Tenants attempted to file their own application, but were unsuccessful due to
an administrative error. The Tenants are entitled to proceed with their claims
by way of section 82 but request additional time to obtain legal
representation, gather evidence and contact potential witnesses. 
3.    As
the Tenants were not ready to proceed with their claims by way of section 82,
the parties agreed that the Board would address only the Landlord’s
applications.  
The
Monthly Rent
4.    At
the hearing, there was a dispute regarding the amount of the monthly rent. The
Landlord says the monthly rent is $1,400.00 and the Tenants say the monthly rent
is $1,200.00.
5.    According
to the lease, the parties agreed that the monthly rent is $1,400.00, but the Tenants
are entitled to a discount of $200.00  if the Tenants avoid having pets in the
house. 
6.    The
tenancy began on April 1, 2016, and the Tenants paid $1,200.00 per month until
November 2016. In November 2016, the Landlord determined that the Tenants were
housing various animals and he unilaterally raised the rent to $1,400.00.
7.    The
Tenants deny having any pets of their own in the house. However, they agree
that animals periodically visit the house. 
8.    Based
on the contents of the lease, and based on the fact that the Tenants paid
$1,200.00 for the first 8 months of their tenancy, the Board determined at the
hearing that the Landlord could not unilaterally change the monthly rent based
on his assumption that the Tenants had pets. As a result, the Board found that
the monthly rent is $1,200.00 and the outstanding arrears are based on that
amount. 
Determinations:
The
L1 Application
9.    The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from November 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective January 16, 2017.
10.
There is no dispute between the parties that the arrears of rent
owing for the period ending March 31, 2017, total $3,600.00.
 
11. The
Landlord incurred costs of $190.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs. 
12. The
Landlord incurred charges of $30.00 for administration charges related to
cheques tendered by or on behalf of the Tenants, which were returned NSF.
13. The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,200.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
14. Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from April 11, 2016
to January 16, 2017, in the amount of $13.85.
15. The
Tenants admit that they have been withholding the rent due to various
maintenance concerns. However, the Tenants agree that they will raise those
concerns in their own application at a later date. The Tenants agree that they
can pay the outstanding arrears within the standard 11 day time period. 
16. I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
The
L2/N5 Damage Claim
17. The
Landlord filed an application to terminate the tenancy because he says the
Tenants wilfully or negligently flushed baby wipes down the toilet and damaged
the septic system. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the
Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the damage
18. The
Tenants admit that they hosted a guest from the city for several days who was
unfamiliar with how a septic system works. The guest repeatedly flushed baby
wipes down the toilet every time she used the washroom and washed her hands. The
Tenants admit that it was the guest’s actions that caused damage to the septic
system and required the system to be pumped. 
19. According
to subsection 62 (1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 20016 (the
‘Act’), “A landlord may give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy if
the tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person whom the tenant
permits in the residential complex wilfully or negligently causes undue
damage to the rental unit or the residential complex.” [Emphasis added]
20. While
it is true that some baby wipes are flushable, a reasonable person knows or
ought to know that not all baby wipes are flushable and the Tenants’ guest
should have known that flushing wipes down the toilet can clog any toilet,
particularly a toilet that runs on a septic system.  
21. Based
on the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the Tenants’ guest negligently
damaged the septic system and the Tenants have breached their obligations under
the Act. 
22.
However, I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
23.
This is clearly a situation where the Tenants’ guest caused damage
to the septic system through no fault of her own. The Tenants’ guest was
unfamiliar with the system and did not realize the damage she was causing. 
 
24.
In addition, because the guest’s actions took place in the privacy
of the washroom, the Tenants had limited knowledge of what she was doing and
did not have an opportunity to correct their guest’s behaviour. 
 
25.
Based on these circumstances, I find that it would not be unfair
to grant relief from eviction. 
 
26.
However, I am satisfied that the Tenants should reimburse the
Landlord for the costs associated with their guest’s actions. 
 
27.
The Landlord says that he had to pay a septic system company
$175.00 to have the tank pumped in order to remove all of the baby wipes. 
 
28.
The Landlord provided the Board with a copy of a receipt from the
company who pumped the tank and the Landlord also called a witness to testify
as to why it was necessary to pump the tank. 
 
29. Based
on the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the septic system had to be
pumped in order to remove the baby wipes and I am satisfied that this service
cost the Landlord $175.00. The Tenant should compensate the Landlord for these
costs and an order will issue accordingly. 
The N5 Interference Claim
30. The
Landlord says that the Tenants have substantially interfered with his lawful
right, privilege or interest because CW has been damaging another tenant’s corn
crops by driving his ATV through the farmer’s field. 
31. The
Landlord owns the rental unit, which is a house and a yard. The Landlord also
owns many acres of farmland which surround the house and which he has rented to
a tenant farmer. 
32. The lease
between the parties clearly states that the Tenants rent only the house and the
yard. The corn fields around the house are not “common areas” and the Tenants
are not permitted to access those fields. 
33. According
to subsection 64(1) of the Act, “A landlord may give a tenant notice of
termination of the tenancy if the conduct of the tenant, another occupant of
the rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the tenant
is such that it substantially interferes with the reasonable enjoyment of
the residential complex for all usual purposes by the landlord or another
tenant or substantially interferes with another lawful right, privilege or
interest of the landlord or another tenant.” [Emphasis added.]
34.  Based
on the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the corn fields surrounding the
residential complex do not form part of the residential complex. The Tenants do
not rent the corn fields, they are not permitted to access the corn fields and
the corn fields are rented by another tenant. 
35. As
the corn fields do not form part of the residential complex, subsection 64(1)
does not apply to this situation and, even if it is true that the Tenants are
trespassing in the fields or damaging the corn, the Board has no jurisdiction
to address that situation. The Landlord’s remedy with respect to this issue
lies elsewhere.  As, a result, the part of the Landlord’s application for
eviction that is based on the allegations concerning the corn fields is denied.

36. This
order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further
reasons shall be issued.
It
is ordered that:
The
L1 Application 
1.      Unless
the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before April 10, 2017.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $2,327.23*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to March 30, 2017 and the total charges related to
NSF cheques tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenants, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $39.45 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting March 31, 2017 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application. 
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before April
10, 2017, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from April 11, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 10, 2017, then starting April 11,
2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 11, 2017.
8.      If
the Tenants wish to void this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $3,820.00 if the payment is made on or before March 31, 2017, or
ii)       $5,020.00 if the payment is made on or before April 10, 2017**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after April 11, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
The
L2/N5 Damage Claim
10.  The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $175.00, which represents the reasonable
costs of repairing the damage.
11.   If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing in paragraph 10 on or
before April 10, 2017, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be
simple interest calculated from April 11, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
