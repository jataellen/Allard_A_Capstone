Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-20505-19
 











 
 
 

SSDC (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict RLM and JB (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on December 10,
2019.
 
The Landlord’s legal
representative, SH, and the Tenant, RM, attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from June 1,
2019 to December 31, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a
Notice of Termination.
 
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,678.34 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
 
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2019 to December 31,
2019.
 
4.     
The Tenant has been living
in the rental unit with his wife and three children for five years.  The Tenant
said that he works as a contractor, and that work is slower during the winter. 
He said that his wife started working, and that she is expecting her first
paycheque on December 27, 2019.
 
5.     
The Tenant’s evidence with
regard to his income and expenses was not consistent.  However, he said that he
believes business will pick up around Christmas.  He proposed a payment plan of
$2,000.00 in addition to the rent, commencing in December, 2019.  He said that
he wants to preserve his tenancy and remain in the rental unit.
 
6.     
The Landlord is seeking a
standard termination order.  The Landlord’s legal representative submits that
the Tenant did not provide any documentary evidence of his income or his wife’s
employment, and that his own evidence with regard to income and expenses was
contradictory.
 
7.     
I find that the Tenant did
not provide evidence that proves, on a balance of probabilities, that the
Tenants will be able to pay the rent, in full, going forward.  The Tenant’s
evidence was contradictory, and he did not provide any documentation of the
income he is expecting, nor of his wife’s employment.  The Tenants have not
made payments towards the rent for four months, except in October, when they
did not pay the rent in full.
 
8.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.  In particular, I
find that the Tenants have not proved that they are able to meet their proposed
payment plan, nor that they will be able to pay the rent in full.  It is
prejudicial to the Landlord for the tenancy to continue.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before January
28, 2020.
 
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $5,102.14*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to January 17, 2020, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $54.35 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting January 18, 2020 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 28, 2020, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
January 29, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 28, 2020, then starting January 29, 2020, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 29, 2020.
 
8.     
If, on or before January 28,
2020, the Tenants pay the amount of $7,714.78** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after January 29,
2020 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
