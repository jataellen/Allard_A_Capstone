Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-06180-18










 

AM
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict KH
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's
rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on August 2, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord  attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from May 1, 2018 to August 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination.
 
2.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,475.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
3.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 20,
2016.
 
4.      The
Tenant has been persistently late in paying the monthly rent as it comes due.
 
5.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before August 18, 2018. If the Tenant voids the order, the tenancy will end
on August 31, 2018 and the Tenant must move out by that date.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,443.92*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to August 7, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $48.49 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting August 8, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before August
18, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from August 19, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before August 18, 2018, then starting August 19,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after August 19,
2018.
 
8.      If,
on or before August 18, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $2,769.47** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated until August 31, 2018 and the
Tenant could remain in the unit until August 31, 2018.  The voiding amount
applies the last month rent deposit to the rent for the month of August 2018
and gives the Tenant credit for the interest owing on the last month rent
deposit. If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after August 19, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
10.   If
the Tenant voids the eviction portion of this order as permitted by paragraphs
8 or 9 of this order, the following provisions will apply:
 
a)    The
tenancy terminates on August 31, 2018. The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before August 31, 2018
b)    If
the Tenant does not vacate the rental unit by August 31, 2018 the Tenant shall
pay the Landlord $48.49 from September 1, 2018 to the day the Tenant vacates
the rental unit.
 
c)    If
the unit is not vacated on or before August 31, 2018, then starting September
1, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
d)    Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after September 1,
2018.
