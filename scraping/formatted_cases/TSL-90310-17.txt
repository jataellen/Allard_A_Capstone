Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-90310-17
 










 
 

M.M
(the 'Landlord') applied, to the Landlord and Tenant Board (the “Board”), for
an order to terminate the tenancy and evict F.M.M and J.T (the 'Tenants')
because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe. The Landlord
also claimed administration charges related to an NSF cheque.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on January 15, 2018.
 
The
Landlord was represented by M.Y, licensed paralegal. The Tenants attended the
hearing and were self-represented.
 
Determinations:
 
Preliminary Matter
 
1.     
Midway through the hearing, the Tenants alleged
there was cockroach infestation in the unit.
2.     
The Tenants are within their rights, on an
application such as this, to raise issues pursuant to section 82 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”). However, here, the Tenants
did not have evidence ready to be provided to the Landlord or to the Board and
had not provided the Landlord, prior to the hearing, with notice or disclosure
in relation to the issue(s) they wished to raise at the hearing, although they
claim to have verbally brought the cockroach issue to the Landlord’s attention
in the past.
3.     
It is incumbent parties be prepared on the date
of the hearing. Indeed, the Notice of Hearing, which the Tenants received and
read, states, in part, as follows: 
What
you should bring to the hearing:
You
should be ready to present any evidence you need to support your case. 
Make
sure you bring:
Three
copies of any evidence you wish to use (for example: receipts or pictures). 
If you are
a tenant and you wish to raise any issues that are not in the landlord’s
application (for example: outstanding maintenance or harassment) it is
important that you bring evidence to this hearing to support your claims.
[emphasis added]
4.     
The Notice of Hearing goes on to inform parties
they should be ready to proceed with the hearing and present any evidence they
have to support their case.
5.     
While we declined to hear the Tenants’
submissions and evidence with respect to the section 82 issue(s), as we stated
during the hearing, and on more than one occasion, it is open to the Tenants to
bring to the Board their own tenant application(s) concerning any tenant
issues, in relation to disrepair in the unit or otherwise, they may wish to
raise and to consult with Tenant Duty Counsel for assistance in this
connection.  
The
Landlord’s Application
6.     
The Tenants have not paid the total rent they
were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2017 to January 31, 2018. 
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
November 7, 2017.
7.     
The Landlord incurred charges of $20.00 for
administration charges related to a cheque tendered by or on behalf of the
Tenants, which was returned NSF.
8.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $950.00
from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
9.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenants for the period from February 1, 2017 to November 7, 2017.
10.  
The parties agreed, as at the date of the
hearing, the total amount owing to the Landlord for arrears of rent is
$5,050.00.
11.  
The Landlord’s legal representative requested a
standard order, according the Tenants eleven days to void the order by paying
the stated arrears and the cost of filing the application in the sum of
$175.00.
12.  
The Tenants requested a payment plan. The
Tenants first offered to pay the rent plus $350.00 each month going forward
until their arrears debt to the Landlord is satisfied. As we mentioned to the
Tenants during the hearing, their proposed repayment is unreasonable and unfair
to the Landlord as it would require fifteen months to bring the outstanding
balance to zero. The Tenants later submitted they could afford to pay $550.00
per month plus the rent. This plan would extend over a period of ten months.
13.  
In most cases, the Board will consider a payment plan—even if not
requested by the tenant. However, in ordering a payment plan, we have to be satisfied,
on a balance of probabilities, the imposed payment plan, with respect to the
arrears, would meet with a reasonable chance of success as would the tenant’s
ability to pay the monthly rent, in full and on time, in the future. Here, we
are not so satisfied. A reasonable payment plan, which would necessarily have
to take the considerable amount of arrears into account and formulate a monthly
arrears payment to address the ongoing prejudice to the Landlord would, in our
view, not have a reasonable prospect of success given the evidence presented
and going to Tenants’ current monthly income. 
14.  
The Tenants are a couple. Only the second-named Tenant is
employed. The first-named Tenant is currently unemployed due to physical health
issues and stated she has no income.
15.  
The second-named Tenant testified he is a self-employed software
developer and currently started a cleaning business. He stated the Tenants went
into arrears because, in August 2016, one of his clients in the software
business stopped paying. The first-named Tenant added the couple had
hospital-related expenses due to her medical issues. Notwithstanding the clear
wording in the Notice of Hearing, the Tenants furnished no corroborating
evidence, medical or otherwise, going to their stated reasons for going into
arrears of rent.  
16.  
Even if we accept the Tenants’ evidence about why they went into
arrears, we are nonetheless unable to accept their proposed repayment plan as
reasonable or feasible. The second-named Tenant testified he recently started a
new business, yet when we asked him to provide an estimate of his expected
gross monthly income, he was unable to do so and, when pressed, stated about
$3,300.00. We asked the second-named Tenant how much he could pay to the
Landlord at preset and he said “nothing.” We asked this question because the
Tenants evidence was they wanted to make good faith payments to the Landlord
and were allegedly told to either pay the entire outstanding amount or nothing.
Naturally, we assumed, given the Tenant’s evidence, they had set aside some of
the money they wished to pay to the Landlord in the interim. Apparently, that
was not the case.
17.  
Be that as it may, we are also concerned a fair repayment plan is
untenable given the circumstances. The Tenants’ new business was purportedly
started shortly before the hearing date and the Tenants have no idea what their
monthly income will be in the future and no corroborating evidence was
presented the business exists and has clients. Documents going to the business
registration and a simple client list were documents likely easily available to
the Tenants.  
18.   As stated, we note the Tenants did not make any good faith payments to the
Landlords after August, 2017. Notwithstanding the Tenants’ limited income, it
is not unreasonable to expect the Tenants to have made some payments during the
material time, including even token payments, as a show of good faith and
indicative of their desire to preserve the tenancy. Here, the Tenants paid zero
after August, 2017. If the Tenants did attempt to make good faith payments in
the interim, as they claim, we would expect the Tenants to be in a position to
make a reasonable payment towards arrears shortly after the hearing, or on the
day of the hearing as sometimes occurs. Here the Tenants testified they could
not make a payment in any amount.
19.   As for the Tenants’ proposed repayment plan in the sum of $550.00
per month, such a plan would be unfair and overly prejudicial to the Landlord.
The landlord is a single individual and not a large corporate landlord, which might
be in a position to tolerate the prejudice accompanying a long-term plan and
the significant quantum of arrears. Moreover, given the uncertainty and
vagueness involving the Tenants’ current business and source(s) of income, we
are left unable to find any fair repayment plan would, on a balance of
probabilities, meet with success.
20.  
Having considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and based on fairness to the parties, we
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 28,
2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. While this is not a long-term
tenancy, as the Tenants moved into the unit in late 2016, the first-named
Tenant does, in all likelihood, live with some physical health issues and both
Tenants should have a reasonable amount of time to find new accommodation if it
comes to that.   
21.  
In this way, given the one-week delay in issuing
this order, the relief afforded the Tenants in the preceding paragraph and the
inevitable delay in enforcement by the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff), the Tenants
will have some time to find new accommodation in the event they are unable to
void the order by paying the required amount, as outlined below.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out
below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The
Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before February 28, 2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$3,851.19*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to
January 22, 2018 and the total charges related to an NSF cheque tendered to the
Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenants, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$31.23 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 23,
2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before February 2, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest. 
This will be simple interest calculated from February 3, 2018 at 3.00% annually
on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated on or before February
28, 2018, then starting March 1, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2018.
8.     
If the Tenants wish to void this order and
continue the tenancy, they must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $5,245.00 if the payment is made on or before January 31, 2018, or
ii)       $6,195.00 if the payment is made on or before February 28, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after March 1, 2018 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make
this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
