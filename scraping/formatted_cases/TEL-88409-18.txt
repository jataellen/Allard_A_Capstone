Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-88409-18
 










 
 
 

DRNPHC.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict TV
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Whitby on March 5, 2018. Only
the Landlord's Agent, AH attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent she was required to pay for the period from
December 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective January 29, 2018.
2.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before March 17, 2018.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $411.52*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to March 6, 2018.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $4.41 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting March 7, 2018 to the date she moves out of the unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March
17, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from March 18, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before March 17, 2018, then starting March 18,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 18, 2018.
8.      If,
on or before March 17, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $702.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after March 18, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
