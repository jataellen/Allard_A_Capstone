Order under
Subsection 74(2) and section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006
 
File Number: TEL-76716-17
 
 
 
C.L.P. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict R.F. and M.F.(the 'Tenants') based on arrears of rent.  This
is an L1 application.
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenants because they have been persistently late in paying their rent. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the
unit after the termination date.
 
This
application was heard in Whitby on March 6, 2017.
 
The Landlord’s representative, F.Q., and the first-named Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
L1
APPLICATION
1.      The
Tenants have paid all the rent that was in arrears under the tenancy agreement
up to February 28, 2017, and the filing fee for this application.
2.      As
a result, and pursuant to subsection 74(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), the Landlord's L1 application for an order terminating
the tenancy and evicting the Tenants for non-payment of rent is discontinued.
L2
APPLICATION
3.      The
first-named Tenant agreed the Tenants have persistently failed to pay the rent
on the date it was due.  
4.      The
Landlord submitted that there were four previous applications before the Board
for this tenancy.  The files are the following:
a)    TEL-38905-13
– This application was for non-payment of rent and was heard August 13, 2013
and only the Landlord’s representative attended.  The Board issued a standard
remedial order for arrears of rent.
b)    TEL-44366-14
– This application was for non-payment of rent and was heard February 5, 2014
and only the Landlord’s representative attended.  The Board issued a standard
remedial order for arrears of rent.
c)    TEL-55386-15
– This application was for persistently late rent and was mediated February 27,
2015.  The Tenants breached the agreement and an ex-parte order was issued with
file TEL-59876-15.
d)    TEL-69272-16
– This application was for non-payment of rent and was heard June 20, 2016 and
only the Landlord’s representative attended.  The Board issued a standard
remedial order for arrears of rent.
5.      The
Landlord requested termination of the tenancy based on the above history of this
tenancy.  
6.      The
first-named Tenant stated he lost his job in 2014 and could not get
unemployment.  In October 2016 he began working again in construction but was
laid off after working for 3 months.  He said will be reinstated in this job on
April 7, 2017; however, he did not provide any document confirming his start
date. The second-named Tenant does not work and is on unemployment and is paid
under $1,000.00.  
7.      After
taking into account all of the evidence before the Board, I believe this is not
a situation where conditional relief would not be unfair to the Landlord.  There
have been a number of applications for this tenancy and the Tenants have not
changed their behaviour to ensure rent payments are on time even when the
Landlord had applied to the Board for termination of their tenancy.  I am not
convinced that any conditional order will change that.
8.      As
of the date of the hearing the Tenants had not paid the rent for March 2017. 
The first-named Tenant was told at this time that if March 2017 was paid by the
next day, March 7, 2017, then I would consider extending the termination date
of the order.  The Landlord was verbally directed to notify the Board whether
or not the payment was made.  The Landlord did notify the Board that the
Tenants did pay the rent for March 2017; therefore, the termination date is set
for April 30, 2017.
9.       The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,122.69 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
10.   Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from November 1,
2016 to March 31, 2017
11.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until April 30, 2017
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
12.  This
order contains all of the reasons for my decision within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.  
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The
Landlord’s L1 application for non-payment of rent is discontinued.
2.     The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated, as of April 30,
2017. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before April 30, 2017.
3.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $36.91 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting May 1, 2017 to the date they move out of the unit. 
4.     If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 30, 2017, then starting May 1, 2017,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
5.     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after May 1, 2017.
