Order
under Section 16.1 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TST-90349-17-IN
TSL-91513-17-IN
 
 
INTERIM ORDER 
 
GW
and EK (the 'Tenants') applied for an order determining that JW and WFP (the
'Landlords') or the Landlords' superintendent or the Landlords' agent harassed,
obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with them and substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential
complex by the Tenants or by a member of their household.
 
The
Tenants also applied for an order determining that the Landlords breached their
maintenance obligations under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') or failed to comply with health, safety, housing or maintenance
standards.
 
The
Landlords applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant
because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
These
applications were set to be heard in Toronto on February 7, 2018.
 
The
Tenants attended the hearing and were self-represented. The Landlords were
represented by JX.
 
The
parties requested an adjournment on consent, which was granted. However, as a
significant amount of the Board’s already strained hearing time was set aside
for these matters, the adjournment is peremptory on all parties.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The
hearing of this application is adjourned, peremptory on all parties, to a date
to be set by the Board.
2.    The
Landlords’ legal representative shall provide their unavailable dates for the
months of March, April and May 2018, to the Board no later than February 14,
2018.
3.    The
parties shall attend a hearing on the merits of the Landlords’ application, and
the Tenants’ applications, as set out in the new Notice of Hearing that will be
mailed by the Board to the parties.
4.    As
soon as possible, and no later than 15 days before the next hearing date, the
Tenants shall give to the Landlord a copy of any document, photograph, receipt,
recording, or like thing the Tenants intend to rely on at the hearing.
5.    As
soon as possible, and no later than 10 days before the next hearing date, the
Landlord shall give to the Tenants a copy of any document, photograph, receipt,
recording, or like thing the Landlord intends to rely on at the hearing.
6.    Pursuant
to Rule 19.1(3) of the Board’s Rules of Practice a party that does not comply
with an order for disclosure may not be permitted to rely on any evidence not
properly disclosed. 
7.    Starting
March 1, 2018, and on the first day of each month thereafter, the Tenants shall
pay the rent into the Board, in Trust, as it comes due and owing to the
Landlords, until these applications are disposed of or the Board orders
otherwise. 
8.    I
am not seized of these matters.
