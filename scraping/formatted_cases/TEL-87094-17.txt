L.C.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict C.H.
and C.S. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe and because they have been persistently late in paying their rent. 
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on February 22, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord and the Landlord’s representative, S.B., attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
THE APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from November 1, 2017 to February 28, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective December 21, 2017.
2.      The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending February 28, 2018, total $4,800.00.
3.      The
Landlord incurred costs as a result of filing the application in the amount of
$190.00 and is entitled to reimbursement for those costs. 
4.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,200.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from July 15, 2017
to December 21, 2017, in the amount of $7.89.
6.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
THE APPLICATION FOR PERSISTENTLY
LATE PAYMENT
7.      At
the hearing, the Landlord requested the consent of the Board to withdraw their
application. 
8.      In
accordance with subsection 200(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the ‘Act’), I consent to the withdrawal of the application.  
It
is ordered that:
THE
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before March 6, 2018.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $3,345.40*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to February 23, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $39.45 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 24, 2018 to the date they move out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March
6, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from March 7, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before March 6, 2018, then starting March 7,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 7, 2018.
8.      If
the Tenants wish to void this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $4,990.00 if the payment is made on or before February 28, 2018, or
ii)       $6,190.00 if the payment is made on or before March 6, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after March 7, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
THE APPLICATION FOR
PERSISTENTLY LATE PAYMENT
10.   The
Landlord’s application is dismissed as withdrawn.
