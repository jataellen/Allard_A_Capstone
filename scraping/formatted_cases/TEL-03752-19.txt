Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-03752-19
 











 
 
 

J. S. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict J. H. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes. This is the L1 application. 
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the
Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in
the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another
tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date. This is the L2 application. 
 
These applications were heard in Peterborough on
August 29, 2019.
 
Only the Landlord attended the hearing. The Landlord was represented by R. B. 
 
Also, in attendance was the
Landlord’s Witness and superintendent, Dee Gibbs. 
 
Determinations:
 
L1 APPLICATION
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from June 1, 2019 to
August 31, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective June 16, 2019.
2.     
Since the application was
filed, the Tenant made no payments.
3.     
The arrears and costs owing
to August 31, 2019 total $1,990.00.
L2 APPLICATION
4.     
The Landlord’s L2
application is based on a first N5 notice of termination served to the Tenant on
May 28, 2019 with a termination date of June 17, 2019. The N5 notice of
termination claimed damages of $600.00 due to a broken window.
5.     
This notice was served
pursuant to subsection 62(1) of the Act which states:
          62(1) A landlord may give a tenant
notice of termination of the tenancy if the tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or a person whom the tenant permits in the residential complex
wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to the rental unit or the
residential complex.        
6.     
As this was a first N5
notice of termination, the Tenant had seven days to void the notice by
refraining from the behaviour outlined on the notice and repairing the damage
or paying the Landlord $600.00 for the damages. 
7.     
The Landlord testified that
the Tenant did not pay the Landlord $600.00 for the damage nor did the Tenant repair
or replace the damaged items.  
8.     
The Landlord’s witness is a
superintendent of the residential premises. She testified that on May 1, 2019
she called the police with respect to damage that was caused by the Tenant as
he shattered the glass of the window and knocked it out of the frame. A copy of
the police report was filed confirming this.  
9.     
The Landlord also submitted
photographs of the damage which show the glass window screen shattered and the
frame knocked out into the grass yard of the residential premises. 
10.  
The Landlord also submitted
a quote for an estimate to repair the damage to the window and replacement of
the window screen dated May 3, 2019. The quote estimates a cost of $310.00 +
HST for each glass window.
11.  
The superintendent testified
that the Tenant was the only resident left in the building when the damage
occurred. Further, she had seen the Tenant exit and enter through the broken
window which led to his bedroom. Finally, the other former occupants of the
residential premises had told her that the Tenant had forgotten his keys and
asked them to let him in but as they were all asleep the Tenant opted to break
the window and enter his room. 
12.  
The superintendent testified
that she had spoken to the Tenant in regard to the damaged window to which he replied,
“add it to my bill.”
13.  
As such, the Landlord seeks
termination of the tenancy and repayment of the $600.00. 
ANALYSIS 
14.  
Based on the uncontested
evidence before the Board I am satisfied that the Tenant did not void the N5
notice of termination by either repairing the broken window or by paying the
Landlord $600.00 for the damages. 
15.  
I also find the Tenant responsible
for the damages based on the uncontested evidence provided by the Landlord’s
witness. I say this based on the Tenant’s
response to her when she inquired about the cause of the damage. 
16.  
With respect to the Landlord’s
request that the Tenant be ordered to also pay the $600.00, as there the L2
application does not include such a claim pursuant to subsection 89(1) of the
Act, this request must be dismissed. 
17.  
In terms of the rent
arrears, I am satisfied that the arrears and costs owing to August 31, 2019
total $1,990.00. 
18.  
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $600.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by
the Landlord.
19.  
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 1, 2018 to June 16, 2019.
20.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Landlord is unaware
of any circumstances that would justify relief from eviction. Based on
the L2 application, the tenancy is terminated in a full and final way. 
21.  
Since the hearing date the
rent has come due for the period from September 2019 through to March 2020. 
22.  
An order shall issue
accordingly.
23.  
This order contains all of
the reasons for my decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.  
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before March 21, 2020.
2.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 21, 2020, then starting March 22, 2020, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
3.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 22, 2020.
4.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $4,994.71, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to March 10, 2020, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
5.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $19.73 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
March 11, 2020 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
6.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
7.     
The total amount owing under
this order is $5,184.71.
8.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing on or before March 21, 2020, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from March 22,
2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
