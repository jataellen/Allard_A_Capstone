Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-23727-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


408, 2 OLD MILL DRIVE TORONTO ON M6S0A2


 




Between:


Mona Mohammadnamazi


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Vanessa
Cresnjar


Tenant



 
 
 
L1 Application
Mona Mohammadnamazi (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Vanessa Cresnjar (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that
the Tenant owes.
 
L2 Application
Mona
Mohammadnamazi (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Vanessa Cresnjar
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the
Tenant's rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
 
This application was heard via videoconference on December 7, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative Arya Fereidooni and the Landlord
attended the hearing. As of 1:12 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented
at the hearing although properly notified of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 Application
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period
from July 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective August 3, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant
is in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The monthly
rent s $2350.00.




 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $2,350.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period from September 1, 2020 to August 3,
2021.
 
6.    
The Tenant
paid $5,000.00 after the application was filed.
 
L2 Application
 
7.    
The Landlord
testified regarding the history of late payments
by the Tenant over the 12
months prior to the application. In
all the Tenant made payments late 8 times in the months prior to the
application.
 
8.    
The Tenant
has persistently failed
to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
Section 83
 
9.    
The Landlord testified
regarding efforts to negotiate a repayment plan. The Tenant had indicated she would make payments and then failed
to do so and then indicated she would be vacating
and then did not. This was not the first
time the Landlord
had to bring an L1 application for this tenancy.
 
10. 
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
In light of my findings for the L2 application, the Tenancy is terminated, even if the Tenant
voids the L1 application.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 23, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $7,745.74*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
12, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$77.26 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 13, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
6.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
January 23, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from January 24, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.




 
7.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 23, 2022, then starting January
24, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 24, 2022.
