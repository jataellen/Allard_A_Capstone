Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-92227-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


21, 2805 RICHMOND ROAD OTTAWA ON K2B6S4


 




Between:


Girts Sipolins


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Sergio
  Aiello


Tenant



 
 
Girts Sipolins
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sergio Aiello
(the 'Tenant') on the basis of substantial interference. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on October 27, 2021.
 
The Landlord
and the Landlord’s legal representative David
Lyman attended the hearing.
 
The Tenant
was not present
or represented by 10:13 a.m. although properly
served with notice
of the hearing by the Board.
 
Reasons:
 
Background
 
1.    
The Landlord
issued a first voidable N5 Notice of Termination with a termination date of October 31,
2020. This notice was given to the Tenant on October 6, 2020. This notice
asserts that on September 14, 2020:
 
As per the
attached photos taken September 14, 2020, your unit is extremely dirty,
cluttered, and filled with a huge volume of garbage blocking pathways
throughout the unit. The unclean state of your unit is causing odours
which is disturbing to your neighbours, is damaging the rental unit, and is interfering with the ability
to respond to maintenance and
pest control issues.
 
2.    
The Landlord
issued a second non-voidable Notice of Termination with a termination date of November 8, 2020. This notice was given to the Tenant on
October 19, 2020. This notice states that the Landlord inspected the unit on
October 14, 2020 and that the
Tenant’s unit is “still
extremely dirty, cluttered, and filled with huge volume of garbage”.
 
3.    
The Landlord
filed the application on October 20, 2020.




 
Application Basis
 
1.    
The Landlord’s first N5 was given under
subsection 64(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’):
 
64 (1) A
landlord may give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy if the conduct
of the tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the tenant is such
that it substantially interferes with the
reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex for all usual purposes by the
landlord or another tenant or substantially interferes with another lawful
right, privilege or interest of the landlord or another tenant.
 
2.    
Pursuant to paragraph
68(1)(b) of the Act, the Landlord was only entitled to issue a second non-voidable N5 under subsection 64(1) of the Act if conduct occurs
or a situation arises “more than
seven days but less than six months” after the first N5
was given to the Tenant.
 
3.    
In this case, the substance of the Landlord’s second N5 is not a further contravention but a continuation of the alleged contravention from the first
N5. In other words, as nothing new occurred after the first N5 was given to the
Tenant, the Landlord was not entitled to give the second non-voidable N5 and
the Landlord’s application cannot rely on the second N5 notice of termination.
 
4.    
However, since
subsection 69(2) of the Act provides that there can be no application later than 30 days after the termination
date specified in the notice, and since the Landlord filed this application
within 30 days of the termination date specified on the first N5, the
Landlord’s application can proceed on the basis of the first N5.
 
Analysis
 
5.    
Ms. Sipolins testified
and I accepted that the rental unit was initially provided to the Tenant in a
clean state but that the Tenant has had ongoing issues with maintaining the
cleanliness of the rental unit for 4-years. Although the Landlord has asked the
Tenant to address this issue the Landlord’s efforts to persuade
the Tenant have been unsuccessful.
 
6.    
With respect to the
specific allegation on the first voidable N5, Ms. Sipolins introduced
photographs of the Tenant’s rental unit that she took on September 14, 2020.
These are the photographs attached to the first N5. These photographs
demonstrated that many if not all of the rooms in the rental are extremely
cluttered. This includes papers, boxes, food and beverage packaging and a large
pile of at least several hundred beer cans. There appears to be food matter baked into the surface
of the stove-top and the stove-top
itself is covered in paper, sponges and bags. The Tenant’s sink is filled with
uncleaned dishes and the kitchen counter is covered in foodstuffs, cutlery and empty
food cans. The Tenant’s toilet as well as the bathroom floor are covered in
human waste. Ms. Sippolins also testified that smell emanating from the rental
unit is terrible and that she was concerned about the potential that the
Tenant’s unit could spread bugs and other pests through the building.




 
7.    
Based on the photographs provided by the Landlord, I am satisfied
that the Tenant
was in breach of section 33 of
the Act – which provides that tenants are responsible for the ordinary
cleanliness of the rental unit, except to the extent that the tenancy agreement
requires the Landlord to clean it – on September 14, 2020.
 
8.    
I am also satisfied that the amount
of clutter, including flammable material on the stove, and its distribution throughout
the rental unit constitutes a substantial interference with the Landlord’s
rights and interests on September 14, 2020. As noted in TSL-56403-14
(Re), 2014
CanLII 71667 (ON LTB) at paragraph 11, landlords
have a legitimate interest in ensuring
that a rental unit is not overly
cluttered for fire-related reasons:
the more stuff there is in a rental unit the
greater the fuel load; the greater the fuel load the greater damage a fire can
cause. The Landlord’s photographs demonstrate that there is a very significant
fire load in the Tenant’s rental unit and in my view this degree of clutter
substantially interferes with the Landlord’s interest in controlling the
clutter.
 
9.    
Additionally, Landlords
must also be able to enter the rental unit under paragraph 26(1)(a) of the Act
in the case of an emergency and landlords must be able to provide and maintain
their rental units
in a good state of repair under subsection 20(1) of the Act.
In my view, the
degree of clutter demonstrated by the Landlord’s photographs substantially interferes with the Landlord’s ability to safely
enter the rental
unit and the Landlord’s ability to attend to any
maintenance issues. The smell, also, constitutes a substantial interference
with the Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex.
 
10.  The first N5 is a voidable notice and the
voiding period is October 7-13, 2020. I queried whether there had been any
change to the cleanliness of the rental unit during this time. On this issue,
Ms. Sippolins introduced photographs that she took on October 14, 2020. These photographs demonstrate no material
improvement to the cleanliness of the rental unit. This evidence satisfies me
on the balance of probabilities that the Tenant did not void the N5 notice of
termination.
 
Relief from
Eviction
 
11.  I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. In particular, the Tenant did not
attend the hearing and did not present evidence on this issue and the Landlord
was unaware of any circumstances that would favour refusal of or postponement
of eviction.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 22, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$11,144.67, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from November 9, 2020
to January 11, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit. The Landlord must give credit to the Tenant for any payments
already received.




 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $28.43
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from January 12, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before January
22, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 23, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 22, 2022, then starting
January 23, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 23, 2022.
