Tenant



 
 
 
Hood Property Management (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Bruce Ford (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 20, 2021. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative Tim Currie attended the hearing. As of 10:14 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented
at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the
Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from March 1, 2021 to October
31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective September 10, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant
vacated the rental
unit on October 31, 2021. The Tenant was in possession
of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     
The lawful
monthly rent was
$950.00.
 
4.     
The Tenant
has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.     
The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $950.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
 
6.     
Interest on the rent
deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 1, 2020 to September 10,
2021.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenancy
is terminated as of October 31, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.

2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $2,853.76*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to October 31, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 17, 2022, the
Tenant will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 18, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
