Order under Sections 30 and 31
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOT-38092-19
 
 
The EOPB (the 'Tenant') applied
for an order determining that RVPI, HD and JD (the 'Landlords') failed to meet
the Landlords' maintenance obligations under the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), that the Landlords
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or
residential complex by them and that the Landlords withheld or deliberately
interfered with the reasonable supply of a vital service that the Landlords are
obligated to supply under the tenancy agreement.
 
This application was heard on June 17, 2021 in VC75 and on
July 22, 2021 in Passcode 215 965
491 VC 75. (‘AM’), being daughter of
the Tenant whose estate is named as the applicant, KO, being a former case
worker on the application, and the Tenant’s representative, (‘AB-S’),
attended the hearing
on June 17, 2021 and only the
Tenant’s representative, AB-S, attended the hearing on July 22, 2021.
 
This application is one of 16
related tenant applications against the Landlords concerning the effective shut down of a mobile
home park (the ‘Park’)
and certain maintenance and repair issues leading up to the time of the
effective shut down.
 
Refer to order NOT-33990-18-HR (the ‘Base Order’)
issued February 1, 2022, concurrently with this and the other 14 related individual Tenant
applications. That order sets out my
determinations on the liability of the Landlords pertaining to events
leading up to the Park’s closure and the availability of
remedies related to the closure itself.
 
The application under file number NOT-33990-18 was a
multi-tenant T2 application brought
on behalf of fifteen
tenants identified in Schedule 1 to that order (‘Park
Tenants’), seeking relief for
the discontinuance of power to the Park. A
separate T6 application and/or T2 application was brought by each of the
fifteen Park Tenants, seeking relief for the Landlords’ actions and inactions
pertaining to the Park’s water supply, the Park’s sewage system and the
effective closure of the Park. This application under file NOT-38992-19 is one
of those applications.




 
The hearing of issues common to
all of the applications, meaning common to the application under file number NOT-33990-18 and the fifteen
individual applications, proceeded
to completion on July 22,
2022 in Passcode 215 965 491 VC 75 following a number of earlier appearances.
The hearing of the Tenant’s individual issues under file number NOT-358092-19 proceeded on June 17,
2019. The procedural history is set out in the Base Order.
 
For clarity, this order will refer to the E. applicant as the ‘Tenant’
and to the individual P.B as the ‘Tenant PB’.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
As set out in the Base Order, I find that that:
 
a)    
The Landlords withheld or interfered with the provision
of electricity, a vital service;
 
b)     The Landlords failed
to repair or maintain the Park’s sewage
system, allowing problems with sewage discharges and
significant odours over a period that extends back prior to one year prior to
the Tenant’s application filing in September 2019;
 
c)      The Landlords failed
to repair or maintain the Park’s water
system such that the supply of potable water was compromised
for roughly two weeks at the beginning of
March 2018 and throughout the period June through October 2018;
 
d)     The Landlords’ failures
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the units and the Park by the Tenants,
both prior to and after October 2018; and
 
e)    
The above failures, combined with
the Landlords’ decision to cease providing all services at the Park as of October, 2018, attract various
remedies, some pertaining to events leading up to the October 2018 effective closure and
pertaining to events following that effective closure.
 
2.    The Tenant claims for two classes of remedies: first,
those attributable to the wrongdoing of the Landlords prior to the
Park’s effective closure in October 2018; and second; those attributable to the
closure.
 
3.   
I
find the following
facts on the basis of the uncontroverted testimony of the AM, the daughter of the Tenant PB;
 
a)     The Tenant lived
at the Park for eight years before she vacated
in September 2018;
 
b)     The Tenant contributed $45.00 to the cost of repairing a transformer at the Park in
early September 2018;
 
c)     
The Tenant vacated further
to the notice from the Landlords that the Park was to close
at the end of October 2018 and further to the water and sewage problems
at the Park;
 
d)     The Tenant incurred
$200.00 in moving
costs;




 
 
 
e)     The Tenant paid $165.00 for the removal
of a heater from the
trailer;
 
f)       The Tenant suffered
a loss of roughly $15,000.00 in the value
of the trailer;
 
g)     The Tenant’s new rent was $678.00 higher per month
than the Park rent;
 
h)     Departure from the Park bothered
the Tenant greatly. She loved the location
of the Park and of her trailer
and did not want to move from the Park; and
 
i)       
The Tenant passed away in February
2019.
 
 
First Type of Remedies
- for the Period Prior
to October 30 2018
 
4.   
No remedies are available to
the Tenant for the first type of remedies. The
Tenant’s application was filed on September
30, 2019. No remedy is available to the Tenant for
events prior to that date and she vacated the Park on that date.
 
Second Type of Remedies - Pursuant to the Park Closure
 
5.   
For the second type of remedies,
as set out in the Base Order, I find
the following:
 
a)     The Tenant is not entitled
to compensation for the loss of value of the value of the
mobile home;
 
b)    
The Tenant is entitled
to compensation for the increased costs of rent,
over and above the rental rate at the Park, for
the five month period following September 30,2018, when she vacated the Park,
through to February 2019 when she passed away.
 
c)     
The Tenant is entitled
to compensation for costs of moving; and
 
d)    
The Tenant may be entitled to damages for interference with reasonable enjoyment.
 
6.    I find that the Tenant is entitled
to payment of the $3,390.00 increase in rent for a period of
five months.
 
7.   
I
find that the Tenant is entitled to $200.00 for the costs of moving.
 
8.   
I
find that the Tenant is not entitled
to payment for the costs
of removing the heater. As set
out in the Base Order, I find that certain costs would have been incurred by
the Park
Tenants regardless of whether the
Landlords complied with the Act’s requirements for proper closure
of the Park. The lost value of the mobile home is one such cost, for which
the Tenant is not entitled to
recovery. The cost of removing the heater when the Tenant PB
vacated the Park is another.




 
9.   
I
recognize that it is likely
that the months leading up to the Tenant PB’s decision to vacate
would have been difficult for the Tenant PB, particularly in light of her
medical problems. However, the Tenant PB mitigated the impacts by moving to new
accommodation in advance of receiving confirmation of the Park’s closure. She has
been awarded compensation for the increased rent. I find that a damages award is not warranted in the circumstances.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlords shall pay to the Tenant a total of $3,590.00, representing payment for the following:
 
a)     $3,390 for the increase in rent for 5 months
following the departure of the Tenant
PB from the Park; and
 
b)     $200.00 for the costs of moving.
 
2.    
The Landlords shall pay the Tenant the full amount owing by March 31, 2022.
 
3.    
If the Landlords do not pay the
Tenant the full amount owing by March 31, 2022 the Landlords will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from April 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
