Anis Malam and Sabiha Malam (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jason Barter (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 2, 2022. Only
the Landlord's Legal Representative, Yasmin Van Maurik, attended
the hearing. As of 10:58 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period from December 1, 2020 to February 28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords
served a Notice of Termination
effective September 15, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on
January 2, 2022. The Tenant
was in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,000.00.
 
4.    
The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $775.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlords.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from November 1, 2011
to December 31, 2020.
 
6.    
The Tenant paid $1,000.00
after the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on

2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $7,143.68*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 2, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing* on or before February 25, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually
on the balance outstanding.
