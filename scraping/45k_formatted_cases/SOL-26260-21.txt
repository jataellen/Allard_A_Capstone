Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26260-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


2(UPPER), 79 BURGAR STREET WELLAND ON L3B2S9


 




Between:


2537782 On Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Michael Jacob Curtis Sarah Johanna Koekoek


Tenants



 
 
 
2537782 On Inc. (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sarah Johanna Koekoek
and Michael Jacob Curtis (the 'Tenants') because
they have been persistently
late in paying their rent.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 956 0593 7653#
on February 9, 2022.
Only the Landlord’s Representative, Judith Callender attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have persistently failed
to pay the rent on the date it was due
twelve times before the N8 Notice was
given.
 
2.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would
not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection
83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. The
Landlord requested a conditional order for the
duration of the tenancy to allow the Tenants to preserve the tenancy. A twelve- month conditional order ought to be enough
for the Tenants to change their habit and pay rent on time.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall pay the Landlord rent on
time and in full on the first day of each month for a twelve-month period starting
March 1, 2022 to February 1, 2023.
 
2.     If the Tenants fail to make any one of the payments on
time and in full pursuant to paragraph 1 of this order the Landlord
may, without notice to the Tenants apply to the




File Number: SOL-26260-21
 
Board pursuant to section
78 of the Act for an order
terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenants.
