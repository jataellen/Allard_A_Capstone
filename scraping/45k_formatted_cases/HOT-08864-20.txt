In the matter
of:


375077 6TH LINE AMARANTH ON L9W0M8


 




Between:


Tom Andrews Shannon Cork


Tenant




 


 
and


 




 


Mohinder/Sandeep Singh


Landlord



 
 
 
Tom Andrews and Shannon Cork (the
'Tenants') applied for an order determining that Mohinder/Sandeep Singh (the 'Landlord') failed to meet the Landlord's maintenance obligations
under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') or failed to
comply with health, safety, housing or maintenance standards.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 14,
2022.
 
Only the Tenant, Tom Andrews
attended the hearing. The matter was called at 10:51 am, and neither the Landlord nor anyone representing the Landlord had attended.
The hearing proceeded uncontested.
The Tenant spoke with Tenant Duty Counsel ahead of the hearing.
 
Chimney & Heat
 
1.    
The Tenant testified that he had moved into the unit, which he described as being a farmhouse in April 2020.
 
2.     In May of 2020 a fire had occurred in the chimney
filling the house with smoke. The Tenant testified that on the same day of the
fire, the chimney repair person who had attended to repair the damage had advised him that he had repaired
the same chimney
in September of 2019 and that the Landlord
was aware of the issues
with the chimney
as he had to repair it back
then. The Tenant notified the Landlord was made aware of this issue the day of the fire but did
not conduct any repairs to the chimney.
 
3.     The House was heated by multiple methods, including a
wood stove that was connected to the damaged chimney. As a result of the fire,
the house had no heat. The Landlord suggested that the Tenant use space
heaters. The home also had a furnace, but the furnace was not working. The
Tenant had advised the Landlord of this issues the same day of the chimney
fire but refused
to complete any repairs
of the chimney or the furnace.




 
4.    
The Tenant testified that the
space heaters had cost him about $325.00 in
electricity costs a month to run. He would use the space heaters even during
the summer months on colder evenings.
He is seeking $2,600.00 in compensation for out of pocket expenses, which represents using the space
heaters for a total of 8 months, at $325.00 per month.
 
5.    
I
accept the Tenants
uncontested evidence and find that the Landlord
failed to maintain the rental unit. The Landlord having been promptly made aware of the damage and not
conducting or arranging for any repairs whatsoever, I find that the Landlord breached section 20(1) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”).
 
6.     The Tenant never
submitted any evidence to support these expenses. That said, I find on a balance of
probabilities that the costs incurred by the Tenant are reasonable. While the
Tenant sought costs for the 8 months
spanning from when he moved into the unit until he filed this
application in November of 2020, I
find that the expenses are reasonable
for the months of May, June 1st to 15th, September, October and 10 days in November including the day he filed application on
November 10th, 2020 for a total of $1245.83.($325/30 x 25 days + $325 x 3 = $1245.83). Section
4(1) of Ontario Regulation 516/06 states that heat is a vital service
during the above-noted time duration, and the Landlord
had an obligation to provide this service.
 
Water
 
7.     The Tenant further testified that when he took possession of the unit on April 6th 2020, that he had issues with accessing
water for the unit as the house
was on a well system and it appeared as though the well
pump was broken. He had advised the Landlord of this issue on
April 6th, 2020, but the Landlord refused to fix any defects
with the water.
 
8.    
As a result of the Landlord’s refusal to conduct
any repair, the Tenant had to arrange for his own repairs of the
well system. The Tenant
had to install a well pump to get water
to the house at a cost of $700.00.
 
9.     On September 21st, 2020, the Tenant
had noticed that water pipes had been broken in the unit. He contacted the Landlord
that day about the issue however, the Landlord refused to conduct any repairs.
 
10.  The Tenant had to pay out of pocket expenses
to replace the defective water tank which had caused the issue with the pipe.
The labour cost was $600.00. There was an additional cost of $230 for various
parts as well.
 
11.  I accept the Tenants uncontested evidence on the issue with the water and find that the Landlord failed to maintain
the rental unit. The Landlord having been promptly made aware of the damage and not conducting or arranging for any repairs
whatsoever, I find that the Landlord breached section
20(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”).
 
12. 
The total out of
pocket expense for the Tenant was $1430.00. Despite not having submitted any receipts for this work, I find the expenses
to be reasonable. The repair




 
work of the well system
was successful and as such, the repair work that was arranged by the Tenant on September 21st,
2020 is authorized.
 
Determinations:
 
13.  Therefore, I find that the Landlord failed to meet the
Landlord's obligations under subsection 20(1) of the Act to maintain the rental unit and failed to comply with housing
maintenance standards.
 
14. 
The Tenant provided the Landlord with reasonable notice of the issues with the chimney and heating as well as the water, yet the Landlord
took no action to repair these defects.
 
It is ordered that:
 
15.  The Landlord shall pay to the Tenant
$1,430.00, which is the cost of the work.
 
16.  The Landlord shall also pay to the Tenant $1,245.83
which is the reasonable out-of- pocket expenses the Tenant
has incurred for the utility costs
of space heaters.
These expenses were incurred because of the Landlord's failure to repair
and maintain the rental unit’s heating system.
 
17.   
The total amount the Landlord owes the Tenant
is $2675.83.
 
18.  The Landlord shall pay the Tenant the full amount
owing by February
22, 2022.
 
19.  If the Landlord does
not pay the Tenant the full amount owing by
February 22, 2022 the Landlord will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February
23, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the outstanding balance.
