Tenant



 
 
 
 
This order originally issued
on February 1, 2022. It subsequently came to this Member’s attention that the payment due date had
the incorrect year and the enforcement clause
was omitted. Although these errors have absolutely no effect on the
outcome of the hearing, the order is
amended to correct this clerical error. The amended portions are bolded and underlined for ease of
reference.
Crystal-Lynn Beland (the
'Tenant') filed a motion to set aside order EAL-95073-21 because, before the eviction order
was enforced, the Tenant paid the amount
required under subsection 74(11) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') to void the order.
 
This motion was heard
by videoconference on December 21, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Lorrie
McCullough, attended the hearing. As of 1:26 p.m., the Tenant was not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
For the reasons that follow, the Tenant’s motion to void is granted,
if the condition is met.
 
2.    
The Landlord's Legal Representative does not dispute
that the Tenant has paid
$5,786.00 to the Landlord which technically voids the order. However,
the Landlord I still
seeking termination of the tenancy because the Tenant is not present to present
her motion plus, she did not pay by September 28, 2021, the date specified in
the order.
Further, it is prejudicial to the Landlord
because the Tenant paid the final amount owing, the $186.00 filing fee, after the
Landlord had filed with the Sheriff.
 
3.    
Section 74 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) provides that a tenant may
avoid an eviction in three circumstances: before the order is
issued, section 74(2);
after the order is issued, section 74(3); and, after the order is
enforceable, section 74(11).




 
 
 
4.    
The sections at play here are with respect
to the Tenant voiding the order “after the order is enforceable”, sections 74(11)
through (18), which say:
 
(11)   A tenant may
make a motion to the Board, on notice to the landlord, to set aside an eviction order
referred to in subsection (3) if, after the order
becomes enforceable but before
it is executed, the tenant
pays an amount to the landlord or to the Board and files an affidavit
sworn by the tenant stating that the amount, together with any amounts
previously paid to the landlord or to the Board, is at least the sum of the
following amounts:
1. 
The amount of rent that is in arrears under the tenancy
agreement.
2.  
The amount of additional rent that would have been due under the
tenancy agreement as at the date of payment
by the tenant had notice
of termination not been
given.
3.
The amount of NSF cheque
charges charged by financial institutions to the landlord in respect of cheques
tendered to the landlord by or on behalf of the tenant,
as allowed by the Board in an
application by the landlord under section 87.
4. 
The amount of administration charges
payable by the tenant for the NSF cheques,
as allowed by the Board in an application by the landlord under section 87.
5. 
The costs ordered
by the Board.
(11.1) The Board shall refuse to accept for filing a motion under subsection (11) if the tenant
has not complied with all the requirements of that subsection.
(12)   Subsection (11)
does not apply if the tenant has previously made a motion under that subsection
during the period of the tenant’s tenancy agreement with the landlord.
(13)   An order under
subsection (3) is stayed when a motion under subsection (11) is accepted for filing by the Board and shall not be enforced under this Act or as an order
of the Superior Court of
Justice during the stay. Application
of subs. (13)
(13.1) For greater certainty, subsection (13) applies only if the
affidavit filed by the tenant in support of the motion under subsection (11)
complies with all the requirements of that subsection. (14) Subject to subsection (15), if a tenant
makes a motion under subsection (11), the Board shall, after a hearing,
(a) 
make an order declaring the order under subsection (3) to be
void, if the tenant has paid the amounts set out in subsection (11); or
(b) 
make an order lifting the stay of the order under subsection (3),
if the tenant has not paid the amounts set out in subsection (11).
(15)   If, on a motion
under subsection (11), the Board determines that the landlord has paid any
non-refundable amount under the Administration of Justice Act for the
purpose of enforcing the order under subsection (3), the Board shall specify
that amount in the order made under clause (14) (a) and shall provide in the
order that it is not effective unless,
(a) 
the tenant pays the specified amount into the Board by a date
specified in the order; and
(b) 
an employee in the Board issues a notice under subsection (16).
(16)   If subsection
(15) applies to an order made under clause (14) (a) and the tenant pays the
amount specified in the order into the Board by the date specified in the
order, an employee in the Board shall issue a notice to the tenant
and the landlord
acknowledging that the
eviction order is void.
(17)   If subsection
(15) applies to an order made under clause (14) (a) and the tenant does not pay
the amount specified in the order into the Board by the date specified in the
order, the stay of the order under subsection (3) ceases to apply and the order
may be enforced.
(18)   If the Board makes an order under clause
(14) (b), the Board may make an order that the tenant pay to the landlord any
non-refundable amount paid by the landlord under the Administration of
Justice Act for the purpose of enforcing the order under subsection (3).




 
5.     It is undisputed that the Tenant payed the required
amount, therefore, she has complied with section 74(11) and pursuant to section
74(11.1) there is no reason for the Board to deny the Tenant’s motion.
I am granting the motion
based on the properly filed
paperwork and the fact that the proper amount was paid; it is not
necessary that the Tenant be present for me to grant this motion under these
circumstances.
 
6.     As the Landlord's Legal Representative did not raise
that the Tenant had made such a motion before, I find the Tenant has not
previously made a motion under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside an eviction order during the period of the Tenant's
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
7.    
I find the Landlord has paid
$316.56 under the Administration of Justice Act for the purpose of enforcing the Landlord's eviction
order EAL-95073-21 dated September
14, 2021 and this amount is non-refundable.
 
8.     This order contains
all the reasons
for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order EAL-95073-21 is void and cannot be enforced by the Landlord if the terms set out
in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this order are met.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay$316.56 to the Board on or before
January 21, 2022. This amount represents the non-refundable
amount the Landlord paid to enforce the eviction order.
 
3.    
If the Tenant pays the amount set out in paragraph
2 on or before January 21, 2022, then an
employee of the Board will issue a notice acknowledging that the eviction order issued
on September 14, 2021 is void.
 
4.    
If the Tenant complies
with paragraph 2, then the amount of $314.56
paid into the Board by the Tenant shall be paid out
to the Landlord.
 
5.    
If the Tenant
does not pay the amount set out in paragraph
2 on or before January
21, 2022, then the stay of order EAL-95073-21 issued on January 6, 2022
and amended on February 8, 2022
ceases to apply and the order may be enforced.
