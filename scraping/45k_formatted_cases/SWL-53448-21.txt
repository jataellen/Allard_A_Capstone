Gordon Gibb


Tenant



 
On July 30, 2021, Hood Property
Management (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Gordon
Gibb (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by
the Board on June 17, 2021 with respect to application SWL- 45790-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the
Tenant did not meet certain
condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenant
or his guests or occupants
of the rental unit was not to tamper with or
disable the smoke detector in the rental unit.
 
On
July 23, 2021, upon inspection of the unit and a fire prevention order to deal
with a breaker panel, the assistant building
manager and the electrician found the
hardwired smoke detector was taken off the ceiling mount, one of the wires was
not connected and the censor was covered with tape.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
Order SWL-45790-20 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 15, 2022.
 
3.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
