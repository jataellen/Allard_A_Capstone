Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-36612-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


BASEMENT, 318 OSIRIS
DRIVE RICHMOND HILL ON L4C2P5


 




Between:


Hang Hua Lin


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Paul Richard Harcus Paul William Smith


Tenants



 
 
 
Hang Hua Lin (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Paul William
Smith and Paul Richard Harcus (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the
Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on December 30, 2021 with respect to
application TNL-34594-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants
have not met the following
condition specified in the order: The Tenants did not pay $1,100.00 rent
on or before January 15, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $4,686.00 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order TNL-34594-21. The amount that is still owing from that
order is $4,686.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order TNL-34594-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from January 1, 2022 to February 28, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,100.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from March 15, 2021 to
February 10, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order TNL-34594-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 21, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$5,047.64*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to February 10, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$36.16 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 11,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
21, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 21, 2022, then starting February
22, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 22, 2022.
 
 
February 10, 2022

The tenant has until February 20, 2022
to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by February 20, 2022 the order will be stayed and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of
