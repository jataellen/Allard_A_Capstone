In the matter
of:


12, 15 ARBOR DELL
ROAD TORONTO ON M9W4C6


 




Between:


Toronto Community Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Ivan Lavrik


Tenant



 
 
 
Toronto Community
Housing Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Ivan Lavrik (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did
not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on July 5, 2021.
The Landlord was represented
by Rahel Abera. The Tenant
checked in at the hearing
block but did not respond
when called at 11:10 a.m. although properly
served with notice of this hearing as it appears
from the Certificate of Service.
 
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
February 1, 2020 to July 31, 2021. Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination
effective March 13, 2020.
 
2.    
The Tenant
is in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $ 475.00.
 
4.    
The arrears
of rent owing
for the period
ending July 31, 2021 as of the date of hearing
were $2,750.00.
 
5.    
The Landlord
incurred costs of $186.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
 
6.    
The Tenant paid $975.00
after the application was filed.




 
 
 
7.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including whether the Landlord attempted to
negotiate a repayment plan with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to
grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
 
 
It is
ordered that:
 
 
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 16, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$5,234.07 (less ay payments
made to the Landlord after July 5, 2021) *,
which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to
January 5, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $15.62
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 6, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
16, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January
17, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 17, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 16, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $3,411.00(less ay payments made
to the Landlord after July 5, 2021)** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust,
this order for eviction will be void. This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit. If this payment is not made
in full and on time,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
17, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is




 
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.

located.
