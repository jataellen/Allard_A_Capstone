Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-43761-21
 



In the matter
of:


UNIT #1, 359
PIM STREET NORTH SAULT STE MARIE ON P6B2T9


 




Between:


Robert Higgins


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Devon
Walsh


 
Tenant



 
 
Robert Higgins
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Devon Walsh
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 16, 2021. The Landlord and the
Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord served the Tenant with a
Notice to End your Tenancy for Non-payment of Rent (N4) with a termination date of July 4, 2021.
The Landlord testified that the notice
was served on June 11, 2021.
 
2.    
As the
notice is dated June 18, 2021, I find the service of the notice improper
because it was not in existence on the date it was presumably served.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1. The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
