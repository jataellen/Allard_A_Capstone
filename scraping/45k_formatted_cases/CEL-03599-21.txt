In the matter of:      FRONT, 40 REGENT
STREET

Between:                  David Brown                                    Landlord
 
 
and
 




Crystal Vermee David Patrick


Tenants




 
 
 
David Brown (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict David Patrick
and Crystal Vermee (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord requires possession of
the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard
via videoconference on January 6, 2022.
 
The Landlord, the Tenants,
and the Tenants’ legal representative, Meghan MacDonald, also attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
At the hearing, Landlord
requested the consent
of the Board to withdraw
their application.
 
2.     
In accordance with subsection 200(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), we consent to the withdrawal of the application
 
3.     
The Tenants’ representative is seeking costs in the amount of $450.00 because
she says the Landlord brought
a frivolous or vexatious application and initiated a procedure in bad faith.
For the following reasons, we find the request for costs to be warranted.
 
4.     
Rule 23.3 of the Board’s Rules of Procedure states, “A party who engages in unreasonable
conduct which causes undue delay or expense may be ordered to pay costs to
another party.”
 
5.     
Also, Interpretation Guideline 3 states:
 
A Member has the discretion to require a party, a party's agent or a party's legal representative to pay, as costs,
any representation or preparation expenses of another party where the conduct
of the party, a party's agent or a party's legal




 
representative was unreasonable. Conduct
is unreasonable if it causes
undue expense or delay and includes the following:
 
i.     
Bringing a frivolous or vexatious application or motion;
ii.      
Initiating an application or any procedure in bad faith;
 
6.     
The Tenants say that the
application before us is frivolous. The application before
us is the Landlord’s third attempt to evict the Tenants using an N12
notice. The Landlord’s first application was denied by order CEL-00331-21
issued on September 22, 2021, because the Landlord submitted a faulty
affidavit. The Landlord’s second
application was denied by order CEL-01506-21 issued
on November 1, 2021, because
the notice of termination failed to identify the rental unit and
was found to be invalid.
 
7.     
The Landlord filed the application
before us on October 25, 2021, which was before he served the Tenants with the
notice of termination. The Landlord then altered the filing date on the application by physically
changing the 25 to a 26 in order to make it appear that he had served the
notice prior to filing the application. At the hearing, the Landlord did not
deny changing this date. The Tenants’ legal representative says the Landlord
knew or ought to have known that his application would be dismissed, but he decided
to proceed to a hearing anyway. This makes the
application a frivolous one. There is no dispute that the Landlord has had
legal assistance from a representative in the past and he has extensive
experience before the Board and is familiar with the Board’s process. Based on
the evidence before us, we find that the Landlord intentionally attempted to
mislead the Board by manually changing the application filing date and brought
a frivolous application which he knew or ought to have known would be
dismissed. For these reasons, we find that costs are warranted.
 
8.     
The Tenants’ second point is that the Landlord
initiated a procedure in bad faith. After filing the application, the Landlord
submitted a request to shorten time to hearing in which he alleged financial
hardship due to the Tenants withholding utility payments from him. At the time of the
request, the Tenants and their representative submitted documentary evidence
to confirm that they were in fact paying the utility bills as required. At the
hearing, the Landlord admitted that his statement was false and that the
Tenants were actually paying the utility costs to the Landlord, just not on the
day that he preferred. Based on the evidence before us, we find that the
Landlord initiated a procedure in bad faith when he attempted to mislead
the Board into granting
him a shortened time to hearing by giving the Board false information. For these reasons, we find that
costs are warranted.
 
9.     
Regarding the quantum of costs, Rule 23 says, “where the LTB orders a party to pay the representation/preparation fees
incurred by another party, these fees shall not exceed
$100 per hour for the services
of a paid representative to a maximum
of $700.”
 
10. In the matter before us, the Tenants’ legal
representative is seeking $45.00 per hour for 9 hours of hearing preparation and one hour of hearing attendance for a total of $450.00. We find this amount to be reasonable as it
complies with the maximum set out in the Rules.
 
11. This order contains
all the reasons
within it and no further
reasons will be issued.




 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.       
The Landlord’s application is dismissed as withdrawn.
 
2.       
On or before January 28, 2022, the Landlord shall pay to the Tenants
costs in the amount
of $450.00.
 
3.       
If the Landlord fails
to pay to the Tenants
the full amount
owing on or before
January 28, 2022, the
Landlord will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 29, 2022, at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding
