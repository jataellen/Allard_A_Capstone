Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-11875-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


92 WORKMEN'S CIRCLE AJAX ON L1T0N6


 




Between:


Nadeem Lalji


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kevin Walters Michelle Dunn


Tenants



 
 
Nadeem Lalji (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Michelle
Dunn and Kevin Walters (the 'Tenants') The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard in Video Conference Room 122 on January 11, 2022.
 
The Landlord,
Nadeem Lalji, the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Wazchma Afzaly, and the
Tenant, Michelle Dunn, attended the hearing. The Tenant had the authority to
speak on behalf of the other Tenant, Kevin Walters. The Tenant declined the opportunity to speak to Tenant Duty Counsel.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The application is dismissed because the Landlord did
not pay the Tenants the compensation required for this application under the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the “Act”).
 
2.     The Landlord served the Tenants
an N12 Notice of Termination under section 48 of the Act
because he intends to move into the rental unit.
 
3.     Section 48.1 of the Act states that, “a landlord shall
compensate a tenant in the amount equal to one month’s rent or offer the tenant another rental unit acceptable
to the tenant if the landlord gives the tenant a notice of termination of the
tenancy under section 48”.
 
4.    
At the hearing
(held after the termination date in the N12 Notice), the Landlord confirmed
that he did pay the Tenants the required compensation under section 48.1 on
December 21, 2021 and he did not offer the Tenants an alternative
unit. The Landlord did not submit any evidence to prove his
claim that compensation had been paid and he was unable to confirm if the
cheque had been cashed by the Tenant.

5.    
The Tenant testified that she did not receive
a cheque from the
Landlord.
 
6.     Section 55.1 of the Act requires that compensation under section 48.1 be paid to the tenant
no later than on the termination date specified in the notice of termination.
In the present case, the termination date in the N12 Notice of Termination is
September 30, 2021.
 
7.     I find that the Landlord
has not satisfied a statutory
requirement for this application and the
application must therefore be dismissed.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The application is dismissed.
