In the matter of:


607, 99 THE DONWAY
WEST TORONTO ON M3C 0N8


 




Between:


Nela Tesanovic


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Cymone Stacey Hermitt


Tenant



 
 
 
Nela Tesanovic (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Cymone Stacey Hermitt (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes (HOL-09159-20 - L1 Application),
 
AND
 
Nela Tesanovic (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Cymone Stacey Hermitt
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the
residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the
premises; and because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or
someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege
or interest of the Landlord
or another tenant.
The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring
the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage (HOL- 10367-21- L2
Application).
 
This application was heard
via videoconference on November 19, 2021 at 10:43 A.M.
 
The Landlord's Legal
Representative, Mr. Bradford Christakos, the Landlord’s daughter, Ms.Tamara Tesanovic, as the instructing client on behalf
of the Landlord, and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
The Tenant spoke with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The L1 application was filed on December 17, 2020 and the L2 application was filed
on. April 26, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit when the
applications were filed but vacated on June 2, 2021. The tenancy terminated on
that date.




 
2.    
Therefore, the Landlord’s application to terminate the tenancy is
moot.
 
3.    
The lawful monthly rent was $1769.40.
 
4.    
The Tenant paid $200.00
after the application was filed.
 
5.    
A
last month's rent deposit of $1700.00 was paid on March 3, 2019.
 
6.    
The Tenant owes $17,760.76 in rent arrears
and compensation for the period
from March 25,2020 to June 2, 2021.
 
7.    
The L2 application seeks costs for cleaning charges totalling $452.00, because of
costs incurred by the Landlord from the condominium corporation, which the Landlord paid on
February 17, 2021. This was related to dog excrement
on the balcony of the rental unit.
 
8.    
The Landlord's Legal Representative asked to amend
the L2 application at the hearing claiming additional charges
imposed by building management and hydro costs.
 
9.    
At the hearing, the Landlord's Legal Representative submitted
additional invoices and costs
charged by building management (TSCC 2620), totalling $1414.00 for animal
related cleaning at the residential complex. Following a Tenant payment, a
balance outstanding was $962.20.
 
10. 
The Landlord's Legal Representative further requested the sum of $721.95 for hydro
costs outstanding, which he asserted should form part of the damages request,
and stated the total outstanding was $1173.95.
 
11. 
The Landlord's Legal Representative provided detailed evidence
and submissions related to additional damages caused by
the Tenant’s dog on the grounds of the residential complex. Specifically, the
building management charged the Landlord an additional maintenance/cleaning
costs in the amount of $648.75.
 
12. 
The Tenant disputed the additional charges
being claimed by the Landlord, and indicated she wanted to pursue discussions directly with the
building management about the charge, and in her testimony, she submitted that
this request was denied.
 
Damages and utilities cost analysis
 
13. 
On the date the L2 application was filed, the relevant sections
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act) stated, part:
 
89 (1) A landlord may apply to the Board for an
order requiring a tenant to pay reasonable costs that the landlord
has incurred or will incur
for the repair
of or, where repairing is not reasonable, the replacement of damaged
property, if the tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person whom
the tenant permits in the




residential complex
wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to the rental unit or
the residential complex and the tenant is in possession of the rental unit.
 
 
14. 
With regard to the damages claimed
in the L2 application, the Landlord’s evidence establishes that the Tenant’s
dog the defecated on the balcony of the rental
unit, resulting in the
Landlord having to pay cleaning costs in the amount of $452.00. I am satisfied
that that this constitutes negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit,
satisfying the test in section 89 of the Act. Therefore, the Tenant shall be ordered to pay
$452.00 to the Landlord.
 
15. 
With regard to the additional
claims for damages, these were only submitted the day of the hearing,
and the Landlord
did not provide a reasonable explanation for not seeking an amendment to the L2 application prior
to the hearing. . I I find it to be prejudicial to the Tenant to have to
address these additional claims at the hearing without advance notice.
Therefore, I am denying the Landlord’s request to amend the L2 to add the
additional damage claims. I also find that the Landlord’s allegations of additional damage caused by the Tenant’s dog were vague and
ambiguous
 
16. 
With respect to request
from the Landlord
to add hydro arrears into the damages
claim, at time the Landlord filed the L2 application the Board lacked
the jurisdiction to order a tenant to pay
unpaid utility expenses. (The jurisdiction to award such costs
was conferred upon the Board effective September 1, 2021 in new section 88.2 of
the Act.) I therefore dismiss this request.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy terminated on June 2, 2021, the date the Tenant vacated
the rental unit.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$15,932.44*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to June 2, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest
on the deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$452.00 for the cost of cleaning
of the balcony in the rental unit.
 
5.    
The total amount the Tenant shall pay to the Landlord is $16,570.44.
 
6.    
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing* of
$16,570.44 on or before
February 8, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 9, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
