Tenants




 
 
On November
8, 2021, Gateway Residential & Community Support
Services Of Niagara
Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Cory David Leitch and Crystal
Read Aka Leitch (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the
rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the
order issued by the Board on November 2, 2021 with respect to application
SOL-18138-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenants have not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
On or before
October 19, 2021,
the Tenants were to comply
with the Fire Department Inspection Order 21-230
dated September 16, 2021.
 
On October 20, 2021, the Fire Department conducted their inspection. At that time, they found that the Tenants had not
complied with the Order 21-230 dated September 16, 2021 and issued a further
Order 21-250.
 
On October 27, 28 and 29, 2021,
the Fire Chief,
Scott Lawson conducted follow up
inspections and the Tenants still had not complied with the Order.
 
3.    
The Tenants
were ordered to pay $186.00
for rent arrears
in Order SOL-18138-20. The amount that is still owing from that order is $186.00 and
that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order
SOL-18138-20 is cancelled.




File Number: SOL-26366-21
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Order SOL-18138-20 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 15, 2022.

$186.00. This amount
represents the amount still owing from Order SOL-18138-20.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $27.02
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 5, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.

the full amount
owing* on or before January
15, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 16,
2022 at .00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
