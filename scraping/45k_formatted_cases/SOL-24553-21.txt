Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: SOL-24553-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


204, 40 WEST
AVENUE S HAMILTON ON L8N2S1


 




Between:


DMS Property Management Ltd


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kafya
Jameel Esmayl Sabah Tofik
  Ibrahim


Tenants



 
 
DMS Property Management Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Kafya Jameel Esmayl and Sabah Tofik Ibrahim
(the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 14, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Paul Startek,
attended the hearing.
As of 10:16 a.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
The application is amended to show the total arrears
owing is $1,788.00 not $929.00.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from August
1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
August 26, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $894.00.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The NSF cheque
charges were not substantiated. Therefore, the claim was denied.
 
6.    
The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $875.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent
deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from August 7, 2018 to December
31, 2020.




 
8.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenants, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act. The Landlord’s attempts at
negotiating a repayment agreement were unsuccessful as the Tenants made no
payments after the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated. The
Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before January 15, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $3,696.47*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 4, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $29.39 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 5, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 15, 2022, the
Tenants will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January 16, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
January 16, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 15, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $5,550.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or
after January 16, 2022 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant
possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
