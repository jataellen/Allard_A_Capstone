In the matter
of:


BASEMENT, 9 SEDAN COURT WOODBRIDGE ON L4L3W2


 




Between:


Vigithan Sarachandran
  Fenilla Bghwandin


Tenants




 


 
and


 




 


Bajwa Mohamed


Landlord



 
 
 
Vigithan Sarachandran and Fenilla
Bghwandin (the 'Tenants') applied for an order determining that Bajwa Mohamed (the 'Landlord') substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit
or residential complex by the Tenants or by a member of their household.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 21, 2021.
Only the Tenants attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants allege that the Landlord misrepresented their intention to move into the
Tenants’ rental unit as a means
to convince the Tenants to terminate their tenancy and move out of the unit.
After they vacated the unit, they discovered that the Landlord had not moved in but had
re-rented the unit at a much higher rent.
For the reasons that follow, the Tenants’ application must be
dismissed.
 
2.    
The Tenants’ application is
brought under s. 31 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’)
based on a s. 22 allegation that the Landlord had substantially interfered with
the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit by the Tenants. The Board’s
jurisdiction to consider events that
could constitute a breach of s. 22
ends with the tenancy. In short,
a Tenant’s rights application can only be heard based on events that
occurred during the tenancy. The only factual allegation before the Board
during the period
it can consider is that the Landlord
told the Tenants he wanted them to move out because he wanted their unit for his personal use. That
statement alone does not constitute a breach of s. 22.
 
3.     The Tenants should have filed an application under s. 57 of the Act (Bad Faith
Notice).
 
4.    
Given that the fact the Tenants
did not request to amend
the application and the Landlord
did not attend the hearing, the Board does not have the power to amend an
application




File Number: TNT-28489-20
 
on its own motion except on
notice to the parties. As the Landlord did not attend the hearing and the Tenants
did not request
to amend the application prior
to the hearing, the Tenants’ application cannot be
amended.
 
5.     Accordingly, the Tenants’
application shall be dismissed.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant’s application is dismissed.
