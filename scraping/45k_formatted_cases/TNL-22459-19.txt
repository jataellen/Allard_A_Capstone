Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-22459-19











 
 
 

GHI. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict EMC (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on February 25,
2020.
 
The Landlord’s representative, MB
and the Tenant attended the hearing. The Tenant was assisted by DB, Tenant Duty
Counsel. 
 
The Landlord called as a witness,
(ST), the Senior Property Manager.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from November 1, 2019
to February 29, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective November 20, 2019.
2.     
The monthly rent as of the
date of the hearing is $710.15.  
3.     
The Tenant paid $500.00
after the application was filed.
4.     
There was no dispute that
the Tenant owes the Landlord the amount of $2,530.60, which represents the
arrears of rent to February 29, 2020 and the application filing fee.
5.     
The Tenant moved into the
unit in 2013. 
6.     
The Tenant testified that he
stopped working seven months ago because he got sick (hurt his back). The
Tenant claimed that he was in the hospital for five months from April 2019 to
August 2019. While he was in the hospital, he did not have any income and has
lived off his savings.  
7.     
The Tenant stated that he
was supposed to return to work the day of the hearing, but will begin the next
day. The Tenant stated that he will earn $1,400.00 every two weeks. 
8.     
The Tenant requested relief
and proposed a payment plan that would have the arrears paid in full by
November 20, 2020 (9 month plan) and would pay the rent on the 1st
business day of each month. 
9.     
The Landlord called as a
witness, the Property Manager, ST to rebut the Tenant’s claim that he was in
the hospital for five months. ST testified that he is at the residential
premises every day and has seen the Tenant walking around the building at least
two/three times a week. ST stated that there have been previous issues with the
Tenant and the Tenant has not paid rent in four months.
10.  
The Landlord opposed the
Tenant’s payment plan and submitted that the Tenant’s could pay more towards
the arrears but the Tenant is choosing to pay other expenses. Such as keeping
money aside to give to his daughter. The Landlord also submitted that the
Tenant has provided no documentary evidence of his health situation, his
employment or that he was in the hospital.
11.  
The Tenant requested a
standard order with a voiding date of March 31, 2020.
12.  
Over the Landlord’s
objection and that the Tenant provided no documentary evidence that he was in
the hospital, I considered the Tenant’s payment plan. I do not find that the
Tenant’s payment plan is reasonable considering the Tenant’s income and
expenses. I am not of the view that the Landlord should have to wait for 9
months for the arrears to be paid in full, considering that the Tenant has
income to pay the arrears sooner. I am of the view that the amount of $500.00
per month towards the arrears is more reasonable. 
13.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. I considered that the
Act is remedial and will give the Tenant an opportunity to continue the tenancy
by paying the arrears over several months. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Tenant shall pay the
Landlord $2,530.60, which represents the arrears of rent owing up to February
29, 2020 ($2,340.60), plus the Landlord’s application filing fee ($190.00).
2.     
The Tenant shall pay the
amount set out in paragraph 1, above, according to the following schedule:
                                                On or
before March 13, 2020                     $ 500.00
                                                On or
before April 1, 2020                          $ 500.00  
                                                On or
before May 1, 2020                           $ 500.00  
                                                On or
before June 1, 2020                         $ 500.00  
                                                On or
before July 1, 2020                           $ 500.00  
                                                On or
before August 1, 2020                     $   30.60  
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay
the monthly rent for March 2020 on or before March 13, 2020. 
 
4.     
The Tenant shall pay the
monthly rent for April 2020 to August 2020 on or before the 1st
business day of each month.
 
5.     
If the Tenant fails to make the
payments under paragraph 2, above, in full, the Landlord may collect the entire
outstanding balance from the amount set out in paragraph 1, above, immediately.

6.     
If the Tenant fails to make
payments under paragraphs 2, 3, or 4, above, in full and on time, the Landlord
may apply under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (‘the
Act’) within 30 days of the breach, without notice to the Tenant, for an order
terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant; and requiring that the Tenant
pay any new arrears and NSF fees and related charges that become owing after
February 29, 2020.
