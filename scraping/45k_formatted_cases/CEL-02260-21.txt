Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-02260-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


MAIN/LOWER UNIT, 597 CURZON AVENUE MISSISSAUGA ON L5G1P8


 




Between:


Cindy Wennerstrom


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Bledar Toma


Tenant



 
 
Cindy Wennerstrom (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Bledar Toma (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent.
The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 2, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord attended
the hearing. The Tenant was not present
or represented as of 10:37
a.m. despite being served
with the notice
of hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord served the Tenant with an N8 Notice
for persistent late payment of rent on August 19, 2021. The termination date in the notice is October
31, 2021.
 
2.     The Landlord testified that this is a monthly
tenancy and that rent is due on the first
day of the month.
 
3.     The Landlord further testified that the Tenant had
been late paying rent ten times in the last
seventeen months and late seventeen times over the past 24 months. The Landlord
also testified that the Tenant has
been served seven N4 Notices for non-payment of rent within the last 18 months.
 
4.     Since the Tenant
was served the N8 Notice,
the Tenant continued
to pay the rent late.
 
5.    
The Landlord
testified that the rent for September 2021 was paid on September 3rd. The rent for October was paid on the 2nd, but the November rent was paid on
time.
 
6.     I find that the Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due by
failing to pay the rent consistently on the first day of the month as it became
due.




 
7.    
The Landlord testified that it causes
financial hardship when the Tenant
does not pay rent
on time.
 
8.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $2,060.13 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
9.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period from April
21, 2018 to October 31, 2021.
 
10.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of March 5, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the
rental unit on or before March 5, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$5,575.42, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from November 1, 2021
to February 22, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit. The Landlord shall also deduct any payments the Tenant has
made during this period.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$67.73 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from February 23, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing on or before March 5, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from March 6, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 5, 2022, then starting
March 6, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 6, 2022.

81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction

unit is located.
