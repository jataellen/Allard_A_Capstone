Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-43996-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


06, 715 DOUGLAS STREET SAULT STE MARIE ON P6C1V5


 




Between:


Williams & Mcdaniel Property Management


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Tammy
Bovingdon


Tenant



 
 
 
Williams &
Mcdaniel Property Management (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Tammy Bovingdon (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 988 4914 7021# on January
10, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s representative, John Anderson, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant
has persistently failed
to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
2.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $950.88 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
3.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from March 9, 2021 to November 30, 2021
 
4.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated, as of {Date required}. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 24, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$395.27, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from December 1, 2021 to January 13, 2022, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.




File Number: NOL-43996-21
 
 
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$30.61 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from January 14, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
January 24, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from January 25, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 24, 2022, then starting January
25, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 25, 2022.
