and


 




 


Gail Russel


Tenant



 
 
 
Quratulain Chaudhry (the 'Landlord') applied in this L1 application for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Gail Russel (the ‘Tenant’) and Ryan Dakin
due to rent arrears.
 
This application was heard
by telephone/video-conference on December 2, 2021. This hearing
had been previously adjourned from March 8, 2021 with an Interim Order issued
on March 26, 2021 providing disclosure deadline dates for both sides.
 
The Landlord attended today’s
hearing with his legal representative Leon Presner. The Tenant Gail Russel attended with her legal representative Veronica Jimenez Munoz.
Ryan Dakin did not attend although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board. Ms. Russel
advised that Ryan Dakin was her
son and he had moved out in 2016. The
hearing continued in Mr. Dakin’s absence as per section 7 of the Statutory
Powers Procedure Act.
 
 
Determinations:
 
Preliminary Issue – L1 Application Amended to L9 Application
 
1.       
The parties agreed that the rental
unit was vacated on November 19, 2020. Since
eviction was no longer necessary, the application was amended as per Rule 15.4 of the
Board’s Rules of Procedure to an L9 Application for rent arrears.
 
Preliminary Issue – Application Amended
to Remove Ryan Dakin
 
2.       
Ms. Russel submitted that Ryan
Dakin should be removed from this application because he moved out in 2016 and found his own
place in February 2017. She said she
told the Landlord about it by telephone
and the Landlord offered
to email a reference
letter to any new prospective landlord if Mr. Dakin
required.




 
3.       
The Landlord submitted he did not receive
notice of termination from Mr. Dakin who
should have taken proper steps such as signing an N9 Tenant’s Notice to End the
Tenancy to remove himself off the rental contract.
 
4.       
During the hearing, I was leaning
in favour of keeping Ryan Dakin as a party to this application, based
on the fact that he was an
adult throughout the tenancy
and he did not give proper notice of termination to
end the contract. Despite my obiter remarks during the hearing, upon
reflection after the hearing and in reviewing the documents the Landlord filed to
support this application, I have changed
my mind and believe it would be fair to remove Mr. Dakin.
 
5.       
Although the N4 Notice of Termination (the ‘N4 Notice’) lists both Ryan Dakin and Gail Russel as Tenants, there was no evidence that Mr. Dakin had been served with the N4 Notice. Only one Certificate of Service was filed with the Board which
stated that Gail Russel was served by handing the document to her.
 
6.       
If the Landlord was trying to
serve Ryan Dakin through Gail Russell, he should have included Mr. Dakin’s name on the Certificate of Service, and also indicated
the method of service how Mr. Dakin was served (ie:
leaving the N4 Notice with an adult person [aka Ms. Russel] at the rental
unit); or the Landlord should have filed a second Certificate of Service with
the Board indicating how Ryan Dakin was served with the N4 Notice.
 
7.       
Even though eviction was moot at
this hearing, at the relevant time when the Landlord initiated the N4 Notice due to rent arrears,
it would be expected that he would have tried to evict and collect arrears from
all tenants.
 
8.       
I
find on a balance of probabilities that the Landlord
knew or ought to have known that Dr.
Dakin had abandoned or vacated the rental unit before he took steps to evict. If he had believed that Mr. Dakin still lived at the rental unit, he would
have sought eviction against him; however, his actions of only serving Ms.
Russel with the N4 Notice reveal he likely knew only Ms. Russel lived there,
only Ms. Russel needed to be evicted, and only Ms. Russel owed rent.
 
9.       
This is further corroborated by
the letter the Landlord sent to Ms. Russel dated August 19, 2020. While this letter was not referenced during the hearing,
it was submitted to the Board
as disclosure. I note the letter is only addressed “Dear Gail”. There
were no other letters or evidence submitted that the Landlord intended
to serve the N4 or seek rent or eviction from Mr. Dakin.
 
10.    In accordance with Rule 15.4 of the
Board’s Rules of Procedure, I find it would be fair and
expeditious to amend the application to remove Ryan Dakin as a party. Any prejudice the Landlord may face in having only one person to try to
enforce or collect against is overshadowed by the prejudice Mr. Dakin would
face if he remained a co-tenant to a tenancy he had abandoned (which the
Landlord likely knew about based on his own actions of not serving Mr. Dakin)
long before the N4 Notice or L1 Application were initiated.




 
Preliminary Issue – Admissibility of Late Evidence
 
11.   
There was some dispute
between the parties
whether some evidence
emailed November 24, 2021
should be admitted. Certain documents
such as a police report, emails (regarding rent arrears and notices of entry),
a witness statement, and an updated contract for storage fees were submitted by
the Tenant after the due date given in the Interim Order. I allowed only the police report based on
Ms. Munoz’s submission that it came to her attention after the deadline from
the Interim Order. I gave the police report little weight since it was not
provided right away in June 2021 when it was obtained. The other documents were
available earlier and there was no reasonable explanation provided why they
were not disclosed sooner.
 
L9 Application – Rent Arrears
 
12.   
There was no dispute
that the monthly
rent was $1,950.00
during the time period when arrears were claimed: between May 1,
2020 to November 19, 2020.
 
13.   
The Tenant (Ms. Russel)
was in possession of the rental unit at the time the L1
application was filed.
 
14.    It was agreed the Tenant
vacated the rental
unit on November
19, 2020.
 
15.    There was no dispute that on January
15, 2015 the Landlord collected
a rent deposit of
$1,950.00 from the Tenant.
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing from the date of
collection up to the termination date in the N4 Notice, September 1, 2020.
 
16.    The Landlord claimed the Tenant failed to pay rent
starting May 1, 2020 through to the vacate date, November
19, 2020. After some discussion, it was agreed
that the Landlord had failed to properly
reflect some of the rent payments
Ms. Russel made during the time periods in “line 1”
and “line 2” in the L1 application. Namely,
the Tenant testified she had
paid $500.00 on May 4, $750.00 on May 21, and $750.00 on June 12, 2020. The Landlord confirmed receipt of these
payments. That means on “line 1” of the L1 application, for the period between
May 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020, a total of $2,000.00 credit or “rent paid” should
have been reflected (the Landlord only had $1,300.00 as rent paid during this
period in the L1).
 
17.    “Line 2” was also incorrect in the L1 application. The
parties agreed the Tenant made a payment of $750.00
on July 11, 2020 (the Landlord had $0.00 as rent paid during
Line 2).
 
18.    As a result, the total
rent arrears owing
on the L1 application between
May 1, 2020 to August 31,
2020 should have been $5,050.00 (not $6,500.00).
 
19.    It was agreed that nothing
was paid after the L1 application was filed.
 
20.   
There was no
dispute that after the L1 application was filed, further rent accrued for
September ($1,950.00), October
($1,950.00), and November,
2020 ($1,218.08 pro-rated to the 19th of November, 2020).




 
21.   
The total amount of rent arrears
is $10,168.08. There
was no dispute about the total
arrears (once all of the Tenant’s payments
described in paragraphs 16 and
17 were properly credited).
 
22.    There were no NSF fees or administrative fees claimed.
 
23.    The L1 application filing fee of $186.00 was claimed.
 
24.   
The total amount owing for the L9 is $10,354.08 ($10,168.08 for rent arrears
from May 1, 2020 to November
19, 2020, plus $186.00 costs for application filing fee).
 
Tenant’s Section 82 Issues
 
No Maintenance or Repair Claims
 
25.   
The Tenant’s Legal Representative clarified that any maintenance or repair claims
(ie: front door doesn’t lock) were withdrawn.
 
Harassment Claim
 
26.   
The Tenant claimed the Landlord started
harassing her in March 2020 when she lost her job due to the pandemic and wasn’t
able to pay rent in full. She was
receiving CERB. She said she received “angry emails telling her what type of
person she is”. She could not point
to any specific email.
 
27.    The Tenant then
described an incident which she thought
was on August 27, 2020 but later corrected to August 15,
2020. She said the Landlord banged
very loudly on her door when she was in a work meeting. When she opened
the door he verbally abused her, yelled and screamed at her,
would not stop when she asked him to
leave, and he pointed to neighbouring houses while telling her “they all know
you are a squatter”.
 
28.    The Tenant then described another incident two days
later on August 17, 2020 when the Landlord returned to ask for rent. She testified that the Landlord
put his foot in the door so she couldn’t close it. He told her “I will destroy and ruin you”
while coming closer and closer. She
asked him to step back and leave. He
told her “you are milking the pandemic, I’m going to make things really bad for
you”.
 
29.   
The Tenant said she called the
police due to the Landlord’s behaviour. The police report was made on August 27, 2020. I did allow this report but gave it little
weight since it was not disclosed
as soon as it was available.
 
30.    The Tenant testified on September 4, 2020, the
Landlord again came to her rental unit, made
intimidating gestures like taking a stance of crossing his arms, he refused to leave,
and he repeatedly told her he needed his money. The Tenant testified the Landlord told her she was a horrible
person and the neighbours didn’t like her.
 
31.   
The Tenant had a friend with her during one of the Landlord’s visits to the rental unit “in
early September”. The friend did not attend
as a witness and I did not allow her witness




 
statement as it was disclosed
late. The Tenant described the same type of threatening behaviour from the Landlord
during this visit. She
claimed he crossed his arms, spoke to
her in an angry manner demanding rent, and would not leave.
 
32.    The Tenant also claimed that on November 19, 2020, the
Landlord’s father came to the rental unit and harassed
her. The Tenant was trying to move out as this was the date she vacated. As she was trying
to clean the garage, the Landlord’s father allegedly parked
on the street, blocked the driveway, demanded the keys and other
personal information (ie: where she was moving to, where she was staying that
night, her new phone number, etc). The Tenant closed the garage door and kept
cleaning. She asked her son Ryan to
come over. When they were done
packing the Tenant and her son left. The
Tenant did not bring Ryan as a witness or summons the Landlord’s father. The
Tenant claimed this incident was truly frightening for her.
 
33.    The Landlord testified that he did not threaten or
harass the Tenant. He admitted to
being frustrated about the non-payment of rent. He agreed he had tried to reach out to her on many occasions by
email, letters, and by trying to talk to her. He did not deny visiting the
Tenant on the dates the Tenant described; however, he disagreed that he talked
to her in an aggressive or threatening manner. He admitted feeling increasing
frustration that the Tenant never
gave him clear answers (ie: about when she will pay rent arrears, no
response to his offer to make a repayment plan, no clear response about when
she will move out). The Landlord testified he was upset by the Tenant’s
behaviour of renting out the basement by lying about being the owner, and of
collecting CERB but not paying rent with it.
 
34.    The Landlord described that it was not only the Tenant
who had suffered due to COVID19. He
felt she was using the pandemic as an excuse.
Despite her lack of transparency, the Landlord said he was willing to
try to work with the Tenant because
he understood the challenges. He submitted that her harassment claims were baseless
and done to defame his character.
 
35.    In addition to the times the Landlord asked the Tenant
for rent, the Tenant alleged that the harassment extended to the behaviours
described below with the alleged
illegal entry and bad faith conduct. The Tenant argued
that taken as a whole,
the overall behaviour of the Landlord was intimidating and
threatening to her.
 
Illegal Entry Claim
 
36.   
The Tenant claimed that the
Landlord made a surprise entry into her unit without proper notice. The Tenant claimed that on November 5,
2020, the Landlord and a contractor were supposed to come around
2pm as previously agreed between
the parties; however, they did not arrive on time. She testified that around 7pm or 7:30pm,
when it was dark outside, the Landlord
and contractor knocked on her door. She
was home alone trying to have
dinner. She claimed they “pushed their way in”. The contractor went around the house but apologized for the
inconvenience. The Tenant claimed
that by coming in the evening and not at the scheduled time, this was an
illegal entry.




 
37.   
The Landlord testified that during
COVID19 it was difficult to book a contractor.
He had previously tried to have the walkthrough on August 27, 2020
(there was email correspondence where notice was given two days before on
August 25, 2020), but the Tenant said she was sick, which is why it was rescheduled to early November. There was an email
from the Landlord dated November 3, 2020 advising of the contractor visit on
November 5th. The Tenant responded the day before confirming that
2pm would work. There was no explanation why the contractor visit was several
hours late instead of at 2pm.
 
Bad Faith Claim
 
38.   
The Tenant also claimed that the
Landlord gave her an N12 Form in bad faith. The N12 was dated August 30, 2020
and it contained a termination date of October 31, 2020. It claimed the Landlord’s parent would be moving into the rental
unit. The Tenant claimed the Landlord failed
to pay her 1 month’s compensation as required by section 48.1 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’).
 
39.    The Tenant claimed
she vacated on November 19, 2020 due to the N12 Notice.
She later went by the property
and learned from a neighbour that instead of the Landlord’s father, there was now a
woman with her kids living on the
main floor, and it seemed
renovations had been done (making a separate entry to basement) to rent out the
basement as well.
 
40.    The Tenant said she found Kijiji ads for the basement
unit, advertising it as a newly renovated space of 2 bedrooms
and 1 bathroom. The basement
was listed for $1,450.00.
The Tenant advised her rent for the whole house had been $1,950.00. She suspected the Landlord was renting out
the upstairs and also the basement.
 
41.   
The Landlord admitted his father
did not move in. On cross
examination, he said between the termination date in the N12 Notice (October
31, 2020) and the date the Tenant vacated (November 19, 2020), his parents’ plans changed because
they needed a place
immediately. The Landlord claimed when the Tenant failed to vacate by the
termination date in the N12 Notice, his parents found something else.
 
42.    The Landlord admitted
to listing the basement for rent but said it was done to
assess the market value, not to
actually rent it out.
 
43.    The Landlord said his aunt now lives in the house and
the basement renovations were done by her which did not require his input. The
Landlord testified the initial contractor visit in early November
was for a separate
issue – it was to fix
general wear and tear (ie: change door locks, light switches,
etc) in preparation for his parents, not for any major basement renovations to
rent it out separately.
 
44.   
The Landlord did not bring any witnesses (ie: aunt, father,
contractor) to corroborate his testimony.




 
Analysis of Tenant’s Section
82 Issues
 
Harassment Claim Dismissed
 
45.    The Tenant sought
a 50% rent abatement for three months
(August, September, November
– the months where threatening incidents occurred).
 
46.    Section 23 of the Act states that “A landlord shall not harass,
obstruct, coerce, threaten
or interfere with a tenant.” There is no definition of “harassment”
in the Act. This Board has considered
harassment in the past (ie: TST-62367-15) as: “generally speaking,
harassment is usually considered to be a course of conduct that a reasonable
person knows or ought to know would be unwelcome”.
 
47.    Considering the evidence, I do not find the Landlord’s
behaviour rose to the level of harassment. The
reason for my decision is based on my acceptance of the Landlord’s explanation
that he was just trying to get answers from the Tenant regarding her
circumstances. My decision
is also based on credibility issues in the Tenant’s testimony and her delay in calling the police. Her overall behaviour during the months
in question, does not
persuade me that the Landlord’s alleged behaviour was as frightening or threatening
as she now claims.
 
48.    The Tenant’s oral testimony required
much correction and did not initially match with the details submitted in her disclosure.
It was only after prompting (such as reviewing the police report) that the
Tenant was able to recount details such as the accurate dates of the alleged
incidents.
 
49.    The Tenant also failed to bring any witnesses to corroborate her testimony. Her friend’s
written statement was not admissible for being disclosed late. Notwithstanding
this, the Tenant could have offered her friend as a witness
during the hearing
to corroborate that she was
there and what happened during the Landlord’s visit.
 
50.    Further, the Tenant delayed nearly 2 weeks before
calling the police. The reasonable person would have called
the police right away if someone put their foot in the door, tried to barge into their home without
permission, or was yelling threatening insults at them loud enough that the
neighbours could hear. The Tenant admitted she only called the police after
first calling the Board and they told her to make a report. There was no
explanation for why she waited almost 2 weeks to call the police other than she
was hoping to de-escalate the situation with her Landlord on her own.
 
51.    I do not doubt that the Landlord
likely reached out several times to ask for the rent
and to ask other questions
like when the Tenant’s future plans were. The Tenant may have perceived the
Landlord’s remarks as insulting or
rude during these exchanges; however, these interactions do not rise
to the level of harassment. The Tenant did not seek immediate help or call the
police.
 
52.    For the reasons
above, the Tenant’s
claim of harassment is dismissed.




 
Illegal Entry Claim Dismissed
 
53.   
The Tenant sought $500.00 for the
illegal entry on November 5, 2020. I
find the Landlord’s walkthrough with the contractor on the evening of November 5, 2020 was
not an illegal entry. It was made pursuant
to a proper notice of entry as per section
27 of the Act. The Tenant
knew the Landlord
needed to do minor repairs
to get the place ready
for his parent. The Tenant knew the Landlord had tried to arrange to
have the contractor come a couple months earlier but the Tenant was sick the
first time.
 
54.    The Tenant had agreed by email that the contractor could come at 2pm on November 5, 2020. When the Landlord and Contractor
arrived around 7pm, the Tenant claimed they pushed their way in. Although they came several hours late, I
do not find the entry was illegal but rather the Tenant was complicit in
allowing the visitors to walk around the house (albeit late and
inconvenient during her dinner). If the Landlord or contractor had
indeed forced their way in when the Tenant denied them entry, the reasonable
person would have called the police immediately since people were breaking in when they were
unwelcome.
 
55.    Since the Tenant
had more than 24 hours
notice that the contractor visit would occur
on November 5, 2020, and since the Tenant acquiesced to the entry
without protest or calling the police, the illegal entry claim is dismissed.
 
Bad Faith Claim – Remedies Ordered
 
56.    The Tenant sought
the following remedies
for bad faith:
 
•        
reimbursement for storage fees for 1 year (at the initial
rate of $286.25
per month since November 2020
as the increased rate contract was not disclosed in time);
•        
moving costs of $276.56;
•        
30% rent abatement from September to November, 2020 for having
to look for another place to live;
•        
1
month’s compensation of $1,950.00 as required by section 48.1 of the Act if an
N12 Notice is given;
•        
discretionary fine paid to the Board (TST-44321-13 suggests
$2,000.00 compensation for 5 months).
 
57.   
I
find the Landlord gave the Tenant
the N12 Notice in bad faith. I find the Tenant moved out due to this notice, and that the Landlord failed to pay her 1 month’s compensation as required by the Act.
 
58.   
I
found serious credibility issues with the Landlord with respect to the plans for his parent
to move in and the re-listing of the renovated basement unit. The Landlord also
brought no witnesses to corroborate his testimony.
 
59.    Based on the evidence, I believe what likely happened
was that the Landlord got tired of waiting for the L1 hearing,
and decided to escalate things with a bad faith N12 Notice so the Tenant
would move out of the house and he could re-rent it as 2 separate units as
quickly as possible.




 
60.   
The Landlord realized that the
Tenant was not moving out based on the N4 notice. Dismayed at waiting several
months for the L1 hearing while continuing to accrue rent arrears, the Landlord
then gave her the N12 about his parent needing the place with 60 days notice. The Landlord failed to pay the
compensation required by the Act. The evidence
failed to establish
the intent for the Landlord’s parent to reside in the rental unit for at least one year.
 
61.    I have serious doubts
about the rest of the Landlord’s story: coincidentally his parent did
not move in after the Tenant vacated (although only 19 days had elapsed since
the termination date in the N12); coincidentally the basement was renovated by his aunt who
now lives in the home but did not require any input from the Landlord to make
major structural changes; coincidentally the basement was listed on Kijiji but
it was only to assess the market not to actually rent it out.
 
62.    The Landlord’s father did not come as a witness to the
hearing to explain how his circumstances changed so quickly between October 31,
2020 and November 19, 2020 which prevented him from moving in after the Tenant
vacated. The Landlord’s aunt did not
come as a witness to corroborate that she lives in the whole house and did
renovations to make an
entry to the basement. The Landlord’s contractor did not come to
the hearing to confirm the scope of his work was only to do minor repairs for
wear and tear to prepare the place for the Landlord’s parent.
 
63.    The Landlord tried to focus on the fact that this was
an L1 application, not an L2. Even though the Landlord
did not file an L2 application, that does not remove his obligation to serve an N12 Notice in good faith,
especially when the Tenant raised bad faith as a section 82 issue.
 
64.   
I
find the Tenant vacated due to the N12 claim because she believed that the Landlord’s father would be moving in. Before that, despite the increasing rent arrears, there was no indication the Tenant would
move out. She had the right to dispute the N4
Notice and to defend against the L1 application.
 
65.    The Landlord failed to compensate the Tenant 1 month’s rent as required
by the Act. The Tenant is
owed $1,950.00.
 
66.    The Tenant did not claim rent differential in her bad
faith claim. There was no evidence about what her living situation has been
since vacating the rental unit (ie: whether she rents now or owns; where she is
living; whether she is paying higher or lower rent now compared to what she used to pay the Landlord) other
than her living
situation continues to be
temporary and she has not found a permanent place to stay.
 
67.    The Tenant claimed she had to put her items in storage
and claimed 1 year of storage fees. I did not allow the higher monthly contract
rate since it was disclosed late. I do not find it reasonable to award an
entire year of storage fees. Even if she moved out based on the bad faith N12,
the Tenant’s personal choices should not be financed by the Landlord. The Tenant chose to keep a whole house-full
of furniture and personal items, and she chose
to live in temporary accommodations that did not allow her to bring all her
items out of storage. The cost
burden of those personal
choices should not be shifted to




 
the Landlord for a year. I find
a reasonable amount of time for storage fees is 2 months. The Tenant is owed $572.50 to reimburse for 2 months of storage
fees after moving
out.
 
68.   
I
find it fair to grant the moving costs
that the Tenant
incurred of $276.56.
The Tenant did not show any indication of moving out pursuant to the N4 Notice and L1 Application. I am satisfied she
moved out due to the bad faith N12 Notice and incurred costs to do so.
 
69.    I do not find this an appropriate situation to award a
fine to the Board. The Landlord’s behaviour in giving the bad faith has already
been dealt with by imposing the remedies awarded above. Fines to the Board
are usually reserved for egregious situations, repeat offenders, or if a large corporate
landlord took advantage of several tenants in bad faith.
 
70.   
The request for 30% rent abatement
for 3 months (between September to November, 2020) because the Tenant had to
look for a new place is denied. If the N12 Notice had been served in good
faith, the only compensation required by the Act is only 1 month, which the Tenant has been awarded.
In this case, due to the bad faith, the Tenant is also
awarded other remedies in the form
of her storage fees (limited
to 2 months) and moving
expenses. The Tenant obviously chose
to dispute the N4 Notice and did not move out based on the L1 application. The
Tenant could have equally chosen to dispute the N12 notice and refused to move
out until the Board ordered an eviction (the Landlord did not even file an L2
application). The Tenant should not now be given the right to ask for a rent
abatement for her inconvenience of looking for a new place to live, when she
made the decision to vacate based on the N12 and when she knew there was not
even an L2 application filed.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The tenancy is terminated as of November
19, 2020, the date the parties agreed
was the vacate date.
 
Refer to Schedule 1: Summary of Calculations
 
2.       
The Tenant owes to the Landlord $8,020.91*, which
represents the rent arrears owing up
to the vacate date, less the rent deposit and interest owing on the rent
deposit.
 
3.       
The Landlord owes to the Tenant $1,950.00 for 1 month’s
compensation which should have been paid by the termination
date in the N12 Notice.
 
4.       
The Landlord owes to the Tenant
reimbursement of $276.56
for moving expenses.
 
5.       
The Landlord owes to the Tenant
reimbursement of $572.50 for
2 months’ of storage
fees.
 
6.       
The Tenant owes to the Landlord $186.00
to reimburse for the cost of the application filing fee. Even though the
Tenant was successful on a portion of her section
82 claims, the Landlord
was still required
to bring the N4/L1 application for rent arrears and he was successful on that application.
