  JUDY SGRO AVENUE NORTH YORK ON M3L0E4

and


 




 


Camille Lewis Glen
Albert Simon


Tenants



 
 
 
Rajwinder Singh Dhaliwal (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Glen Albert Simon and Camille Lewis (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on July 9, 2021
with respect to application HOL-09199-20.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved by order TEL-21253-21, issued on January
17, 2022. The Tenants filed a
motion to set aside order TEL-21253-21.
 
This motion was heard by videoconference on February 15,
2022.
 
The Landlord and the Tenants attended
the hearing. The Landlord
was represented by Shalini
Puri. The Tenants were represented by Noland Merrick.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
The first issue on a motion
to set aside such as this one is whether
or not the Tenants breached the order as alleged.
 
2.   
The Tenants disputed the breach
alleged by the Landlord; the first-named Tenant explained that because she had
paid the rent for December 2021 from two separate accounts, she thought she had
paid the rent in full. When she received the ex parte order on January
25, 2022, she realized she had short-paid the rent by $106.00 and immediately
corrected the error by paying the Landlord this amount the very same day.
 
3.    Based on the evidence before me, I find that the Tenants breached the order by not paying the rent for December 2021 in full
and on time.
 
4.    Pursuant to subsection 78(11) of the Act, when there has been a breach to an order,
the next issue to determine is whether or not I am “satisfied, having
regard to all the circumstances, that it would not be unfair to set aside the
order”.




 
5.   
This tenancy began in September 2017. The Tenant
resides in the rental unit with her five
children ages 22, 16, 16, 12 and 10.
 
6.    Since the breach in December’s rent payment, the
Tenants have paid the rent for January 2022
on January 4, 2022 and the rent for February
2022 on January
30, 2022. The Tenant
explains that because January 1, 2022 was a statutory holiday, she paid the
rent the following business day; she remembers
having inquired about this prior
to entering into the
consent order.
 
7.    The Tenants seek a final
opportunity to preserve
their tenancy.
 
8.    The Landlord opposes the Tenants’ motion as the
Landlord submits they have already provided the Tenants with the opportunity to
preserve their tenancy by entering into a consent order for prompt payment – as
opposed to seeking termination in July 2021. The Landlord maintains the
position that the behaviour alleged in the N8 notice of termination has not been corrected
by the Tenants as the Tenants have been late in August
2021 and January 2022 on top
of December 2021.
 
9.   
The Landlord is agreeable to an extension
in the lifting of the stay of 60 days for the Tenants to make alternative housing
arrangements.
 
ANALYSIS
 
10. The obligation to pay the rent on time is a basic term of the tenancy
agreement. The Landlord
should not have to obtain an order
from the Board each time to ensure the Tenants keep to this term of their contract.
 
11. At the hearing
on June 28, 2021, it was the parties’ decision
to continue this tenancy and it
would appear, based on the terms of the consent order, that it was with the
intention to rehabilitate this tenancy. In hearing this motion, I may only
consider circumstances that have arisen since the issuance of the order on July
9, 2021.
 
12. In this case, there
is no dispute that the Tenants breached
the order whether
it was due to an oversight on their part or a lack of
due diligence; however, I am satisfied that the Tenants made a genuine
and reasonable effort
to ensure that the
shortfall was rectified as soon as it came to their attention, demonstrating a desire
and ability to pay the rent owing so that they may rehabilitate this tenancy.
 
13. Given that the Tenants have been abiding by the order
and having regard to all the circumstances,
I find that it would not be unfair
to set aside order HOL-09199-20, issued on July 9, 2021 pursuant to clause 78(11)(b) of the Act
and replace it with a new conditional order requiring prompt payment for the
next twelve months.
 
14. This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TEL-21253-21, issued on January 17, 2022 is set aside.




 
2.    
Order HOL-09199-20 issued on July 9, 2021 cancelled
and replaced with the following order.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord the lawful monthly
rent as it comes due in full and
no later than the first day of each month commencing March 2022 through to
February 2023.
 
4.     If
the Tenants fail to comply with paragraph 2 of this order, the Landlord may,
without notice to the Tenants and within 30 days of the breach, apply to the Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting
the Tenants.
