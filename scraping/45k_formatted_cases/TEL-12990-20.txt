Colleen Quinn Fergus Dunlop


Tenants




 
 
 
Diana Romanovsky (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Colleen Quinn and
Fergus Dunlop (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by video conference on June 29, 2021.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord's Legal Representative Brian Estany and the Tenant
Fergus Dunlop attended the
hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Landlord in good faith requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
2.       
The Landlord collected a rent
deposit of $1,550.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlord. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenants for the period from February 19, 2015 to October 31, 2020.
 
3.       
On August 30, 2020 the Landlord
served an N12 Notice to End Your Tenancy with a termination date of October 31,
2020.
 
4.       
On June 21, 2021,
the Landlord had an affidavit
commissioned, the content
of which states that the
Landlord intends in good faith to
take occupancy of the rental unit for “personal use”, for a period of least one
year.
 
5.       
The Landlord paid the Tenant compensation equal to one month's rent,
by e-transfer, on October 22, 2020.




 
6.       
I
am satisfied that the Landlord
has met all of the technical requirements of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’)
with respect to the application.
 
7.       
The Tenant F.D. acknowledges that he received
the N12 Notice, the Landlord’s affidavit and the required compensation.
 
8.       
F.D. testified that when he was
served with the N12 Notice, Landlord was in process to evict the downstairs
tenant. The Tenant had numerous issues against that tenant. The application was dismissed. Shortly
afterwards, he said, both he and the downstairs tenant were served with N12 Notices.
 
9.       
When asked whether he disputed the application, F.D. testified that he did not but asked
for additional time to vacate the unit. The Tenants have experienced financial
hardship during Covid-19, and the Tenant C.Q. is not longer employed.
 
10.    I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, including the challenges
the Tenants have faced as a result of COVID-19. Given the time that has already
passed since the hearing, which includes adequate time for the Tenants to
secure alternative housing, I find that it would be unfair to grant relief from
eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated as of February
12, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before February
12, 2022.
 
2.       
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $22,565.08, or any outstanding balance thereof,
which represents compensation for the use of the unit from November 1, 2020 to
February 1, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
 
3.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$53.02 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
from February 2, 2022 to the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.       
If the Tenants do not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing on or before February 12, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 13, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
5.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 12, 2022, then starting February
13, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 13, 2022.
