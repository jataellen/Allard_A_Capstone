Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-25349-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1001, 1001 MAIN STREET
W HAMILTON ON L8S1A9


 




Between:


Wilstar Management Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Lida Nosrati
Nik
Raheleh Boostani Farkoosh Ramin Nosrati Nik


Tenants



 
 
 
Wilstar Management Ltd. (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Lida Nosrati Nik, Ramin Nosrati
Nik and Raheleh Boostani Farkoosh
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 1, 2022.
The Landlord’s Legal Representative, Bryan Rubin and the
Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period
from April 1, 2021 to February 28,
2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective October 30, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,619.87.
 
4.     The
Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,585.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from October
1, 2020 to October 30, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenants paid $6,356.26 after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 28, 2022 pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.




 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.
 
2.    
As of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the Landlord is entitled to by $1,105.24*.
 
3.     However, the Landlord
is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenants: $53.26 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 9, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of
the unit, and $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
The Landlord
or the Tenants shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
7.     If, on or before February 28, 2022, the Tenants pay
the amount of $1,789.87** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
8.     The Tenants may
make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that
subsection on or after March 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once
during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
