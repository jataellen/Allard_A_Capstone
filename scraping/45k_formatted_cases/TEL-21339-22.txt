Sebastian Accardi (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tony
Reimchen and Megan Reimchen (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants failed to meet
a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on December 15, 2021 with respect to application TEL- 19271-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants
have not met the following
condition specified in the order: the Tenants did not pay the lawful
rent for January in full on or before January 1, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 4, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 4, 2022, then starting
February 5, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
