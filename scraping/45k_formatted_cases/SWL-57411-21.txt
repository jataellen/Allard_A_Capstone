Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57411-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


304, 160 EMERY STREET
W LONDON ON N6J3W3


 




Between:


Mantler Management Ltd


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kaily Mackay


Tenant



 
 
 
Mantler Management Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Kaily Mackay (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent
the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the
order issued by the Board on October 28, 2021 with respect to application
SWL-53396-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition(s) specified
in the order: The Tenant did not pay $699.99
arrears on or before November
13, 2021. The Tenant did not pay $168.80 arrears on or before
November 27, 2021. They also did not pay
$699.00 rent on or before
December 1, 2021.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $1,566.80 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
SWL-53396-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $1,566.80
and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous
order SWL-53396-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from November 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $699.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from October 1, 2021 to
January 14, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order SWL-53396-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 25, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
pay to the Landlord $2,265.80*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 14, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $22.98 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 15, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
January 25, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
January 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before January 25, 2022, then starting January
26, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 26, 2022.
 
 
January 14, 2022

The tenant has until January 24, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion

and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction

the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
