Tenants




 
 
and
 
Oleksander Kotlyar                                                                                                              Landlord
 
 
 
Chris Stanley and Victoria
Butler (the 'Tenants') applied for an order determining that Oleksander Kotlyar
(the 'Landlord') or the Landlord’s superintendent or the Landlords' agent:
•        
harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with them,
•        
entered the rental unit illegally,
•        
altered the locking system
on a door giving entry to the rental unit or residential complex without giving them replacement keys,
•        
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenants or by a
member of their household, and
•        
withheld or deliberately
interfered with the reasonable supply of a vital service, care service, or food that the Landlords
are obligated to supply under the tenancy
agreement.
 
The hearing was held by video conference on January 26, 2022, beginning at 9:00 a.m..
 
The Landlord and the Landlord's Legal
Representative Reena Basser
attended the hearing.
As of 1:15 p.m., the Tenants
were not present or represented at this hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
There appeared to be some
confusion as to whether the Tenants signed in at 9:00 a.m. to the virtual
hearing. The record shows that
the Tenants were placed on the list
for Duty Counsel services.
At the time that Duty Counsel became available, the Tenants were not
present in the virtual hearing room nor were they waiting to be admitted into
the video conference.
 
2.       
The Tenants were canvassed
by the Board twice during the morning
but did not respond. The
matter was stood down each time to give the Tenants an opportunity to connect
by telephone or video.




File Number: SOT-21014-21
 
3.       
The Landlord's Legal Representative indicated that she followed up with each of the Tenants by email and telephone
throughout the morning but neither replied.
 
4.       
When the matter was called at 1:10 p.m.,
the Tenants were not present
or represented. I proceeded with the hearing.
 
5.       
Since the Tenants did not appear at the hearing to support their application, I find that this
application has been abandoned.
 
6.       
The Landlord is seeking his costs
of the proceedings. The Landlord and the Landlord's Legal Representative waited
until 1:30 p.m. to have the case heard. If the record is in error and the
Tenants did not attend the virtual hearing, the outcome is no different. By not attending
on their own application, the Tenants’ conduct
was unreasonable such that
it caused undue expense to the Landlord.
 
7.       
I find the Tenants owe the
Landlord $600.00 (6 hours x $100.00) for the Landlord’s expenses relating
to the preparation for, and representation at, the hearing.
This amount is in accordance
with Rule 23.2 of the Board’s Rules of Procedure.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The Tenants' application is dismissed.
 
2.       
The Tenants shall pay the Landlord
$600.00 on or before February
19, 2022 or interest
will start to accrue at 2.00% starting February 20, 2022 on the balance
outstanding.
