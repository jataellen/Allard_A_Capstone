Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-41898-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


APT 1, 317 JEANNE DARC
AVENUE SUDBURY ON P3B2Z9


 




Between:


Robert McLean


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Cheryl Madden


Tenant



 
 
Robert McLean (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Cheryl Madden (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 3, 2022.
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period from December
1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective December 20, 2020.
 
2.     At the hearing,
the parties agreed
that the only amount outstanding is the Landlord's cost of filing the application. As a result,
the order will be limited
to costs only and not eviction.
 
3.     This order contains
all of the reasons in this matter
and no further reasons will be given.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$170.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
2.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
February 28, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
