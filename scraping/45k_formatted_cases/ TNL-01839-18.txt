Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-01839-18










 
 

HY
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict AS
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Newmarket on March 26, 2018.
 
Although the Tenant signed the Board’s Hearing Attendance Record
form, the Tenant did not remain at the Board to participate in the hearing. 
Only the Landlord attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from December 15, 2017 to April 14, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective February 4, 2018.
 
2.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $2,200.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
3.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 16, 2018
to February 4, 2018.
 
4.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.  The Tenant did not attend the hearing to give
evidence of the Tenant’s circumstances.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before April 9, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,350.11*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to March 29, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $72.33 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting March 30, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before April
9, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from April 10, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 9, 2018, then starting April 10,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 10, 2018.
 
8.      If,
on or before April 9, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $8,975.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after April 10, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
