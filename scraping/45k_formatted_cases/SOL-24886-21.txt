Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24886-21
 
 
In the matter of:      UPPER UNIT, 473 CANNON STREET
E
DOWNTOWN HAMILTON
ON L8L2E3
 




Between:                  Gillian O'Conner Markus Wolfstetter


Landlords




 
 
and
 




Dale Tario Melissa Karran


Tenants




 
 
Gillian O'Conner and Markus
Wolfstetter (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dale Tario and Melissa Karran
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
11, 2022. The Landlords, the Tenants and the
Tenants’ Legal Representative, Glen Gosling, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the
total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective September 18, 2021.
 
2.     The Notice of Termination the Landlords served to the
Tenants is defective because it does not identify
the rental unit for which
the notice is given, as required by subsection
43(1)(a) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). Therefore,
the Notice of Termination is defective.
 
3.     The Landlords sought
to withdraw the application and the Board consented to the
request.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The application having
been withdrawn, the Board’s file is closed.
