  matter of:


1709, 720 BRUCE
AVENUE SUDBURY ON P3C5C4


 




Between:


Greater Sudbury Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kimberly Mathieu


Tenant



 
 
 
Greater Sudbury Housing
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Kimberly Mathieu (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay
the rent the Tenant owes because
the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on January 13, 2022
with respect to application NOL-44133-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order: The Tenant did not maintain the rental
unit in an ordinary state of cleanliness, as well as insure that the rental
unit was clean and ready for pest control measures on January 17, 2022. Upon
inspection on January 17, 2022 staff noticed that the unit was still in a state of clutter and uncleanliness, and pest control
staff were unable to treat the unit.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 14, 2022.
 
2.     The Landlord is authorized to offset the following
amounts from the amount the Landlord owes the Tenant:
$4.57 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
February 4, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
3.     The Landlord or the Tenant
shall pay any amounts that become owing
as a result of this order.




File Number: NOL-44695-22
 
4.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 14, 2022, then starting February
15, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
5.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 15, 2022.

The tenant has until February 13, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by February 13, 2022
the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on August 15, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
