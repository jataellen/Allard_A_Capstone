Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-21358-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


1047 WARDMAN CRESCENT WHITBY ON L1N3H1


 




Between:


David Harvey


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kristin White


Tenant



 
 
 
On January 17, 2022, David Harvey (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kristin White (the
'Tenant') and for an order
to have the Tenant pay the
rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on November 24, 2021 with respect to
application TEL-18599-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $100.00 arrears
on or before December 20, 2021. The Tenant did not pay $1200.00 rent on or before
January 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $8,586.00 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order TEL-18599-21. The amount that is still owing from that
order is $8,586.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order TEL-18599-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing .




File Number: TEL-21358-22
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order TEL-18599-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 13, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $9,864.90*. (less
any amounts paid since the application was file on January 17, 2022.) This
amount represents the rent owing up to February 2, 2022 and the costs
related to the application fee for the previous application.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$39.45 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 3, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
13, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 14, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 13, 2022, then starting
February 14, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after February 14, 2022.
