EP.I.-C (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict J.O. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on May 6, 2019.
 
The Landlord’s legal representative, J.S., and the
Tenant attended the hearing. 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
Based on the evidence before
me, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Tenant owes the
Landlord $6,029.45. The Tenant has until May 21, 2019 to pay the Landlord the
full amount owing to avoid eviction. 
The Tenant owes the Landlord $6,029.45
2.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from January 1, 2019
to May 31, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective January 24, 2019.
3.     
The Tenant is in possession
of the rental unit. 
4.     
The monthly rent is
$1,188.65. 
5.     
The parties do not dispute
that the Tenant owes the Landlord $6,029.45, which includes arrears of rent to
May 31, 2019 and the application filing fee. Therefore, I am satisfied on a
balance of probabilities that the Tenant owes the Landlord this amount.
6.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,166.76 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
7.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2019 to January 24, 2019.
Section 83 considerations 
8.     
The Tenant testified that
the reason he accrued the arrears is that he was locked into a snow-removal
employment contract over the winter, which did not allow him to work elsewhere
and prevented him from receiving employment insurance. The Tenant testified
that his income depended on the amount of work he got and there were months
when he made as little as $800.00 per month. 
9.     
The Tenant testified that
going forward he is willing and able to pay the rent and make payments toward
the arrears. The Tenant proposed a payment plan, according to which he would
pay that Landlord $1,300 - $1,150 every two weeks from May 14, 2019 to July 30,
2019 to bring his rent account to a zero balance. However, I do not think it is
appropriate to order this conditional relief because I am not convinced that
the Tenant can afford to make his proposed payments. 
10.  
The Tenant testified that
his financial circumstances have recently changed. The Tenant testified that he
now receives employment insurance in the amount of $1,150 every two weeks. The
Tenant also testified that he will soon start working for his father’s deck
refinishing company and he will be making $2,200 every two weeks, with his
first payment expected in early June. However, the Tenant did not submit any
documentation to support his claim that he is receiving EI, how much he is
receiving and until when he will be receiving these payments. The Tenant also
did not submit any written confirmation from his father that the Tenant will be
working for him and the Tenant’s father did not attend the hearing to testify
to that fact. Therefore, I have no evidence to corroborate the Tenant’s claim
that he will be making enough money to afford his proposed payment plan as well
as his approximately $766.00 in other monthly expenses. 
11.  
Most concerning to me is the
fact that the Tenant has made no payments toward his rent since January, 2019.
The Tenant did not provide a reasonable explanation for why he failed to pay
any rent over this period even though he received income from his snow-removal
job and he is currently receiving EI. This indicates to me that the Tenant
prioritizes other expenses over his rent. This makes me concerned that the
Tenant does not have a good faith intention to prioritize his rent going
forward and continue the tenancy. 
12.  
I also note that the Board
issued an order for the Landlord’s previous L1 Application, TSL-99079-18 on
October 25, 2018, finding that the Tenant owed arrears of $2,525.92 up to
October 31st. In the present application, the Tenant’s arrears began
accumulating in January, 2019. This means that the Tenant’s rent account was
only current for two months (November and December, 2018) before the Tenant
fell behind on his rent again. When I look at both applications together, it
appears that the Tenant not been paying his rent consistently since August,
2018.
13.  
In light of the Tenant’s
history of non-payment of rent and his failure to make any payments toward the
current balance owing in good faith, I am not convinced that the Tenant will
change his behaviour and pay his rent going forward if the tenancy was to
continue. 
14.  
When I asked the Tenant if
there was any reason the Board should delay or deny eviction, the Tenant did
not request to extend the termination date. The only relief the Tenant
requested under section 83 of the Act was a payment plan. Since conditional
relief is denied, a standard 11-day order will issue.
15.  
Accordingly, I have
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1)
of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before May 21,
2019.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $3,802.76*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to May 10, 2019, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $38.39 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
May 11, 2019 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May 21, 2019, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from May 22,
2019 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before May 21, 2019, then starting May 22, 2019, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 22, 2019.
8.     
If, on or before May 21,
2019, the Tenant pays the amount of $6,029.45** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after May 22, 2019 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
