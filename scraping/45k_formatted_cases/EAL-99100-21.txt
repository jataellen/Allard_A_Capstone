In the matter
of:


434 SEVENTH STREET
E CORNWALL ON K6H2S2


 




Between:


Bahar Ali Sher


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Rebecca Masson


Tenant



 
 
 
Bahar Ali Sher (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Rebecca Masson (the 'Tenant') because
the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
970 9628 3000#
on January 19, 2022.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s representative, G. Foss, appearing for J. Moak, and the Tenant,
assisted by her mother, V. Porter (‘VP’), attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     As a preliminary matter the Tenant’s mother, VP,
indicated that the Tenant has learning disabilities and difficulties with comprehension. The Tenant requested that VP assist
her in the hearing and assist her with her testimony if she had anxiety
or comprehension issues during the hearing. With
the concurrence of the Landlord, I allowed VP to attend the entire
hearing on the proviso that her testimony be given in advance of any testimony from the Tenant.
 
2.    
The Landlord testified that he
presently rents a condominium in Laval, Quebec. He purchased the unit, which is a house in Cornwall, on September 29, 2020 with
the intent of moving into it
for his own residential use. He
intended, and still intends, to move into the unit.
 
3.     There was some dispute as to whether,
in September 2020, the Landlord
served an N12 notice of termination. The Landlord testified that he served such
a notice on the same day that he purchased the property and that
he subsequently filed an L2 application,
but that the Board ‘lost’ the application and he had to start over with a new
N12 notice. The Tenant testified that she did not receive any N12 notice in
2020.




 
4.    
There was no dispute about the
fact that the Landlord filed the N12 notice of termination on which the present
application is based in
October 2021 by placing the notice under the door of the unit.
 
5.     I find that the service of the N12 notice was effected
at least 60 days prior to the termination date set out in the notice,
that the termination date was properly
the last day of a rental
period and that the Landlord
properly filed the requisite declaration in support of the
application.
 
6.     The key issue in dispute in the hearing was whether
the Landlord had, prior to the December 31, 2021 termination date set out in the N12 notice,
provided the Tenant
with the required one month’s compensation.
 
7.     The parties agreed that the Landlord did not provide a
cheque or other direct form of compensation to the Tenant for the one month’s
compensation. The Landlord alleged
that he provided the compensation by giving written notice to the Tenant, prior
to the December 31, 2021 termination date,
that he was waiving one month of rent which
was owing for a period prior to that date.
 
8.     The Landlord referred to a letter dated October 14,
2021 from the Landlord’s representative, J. Moak, (the ‘Moak Letter’) (Exhibit
1) to the Tenant, filed with the Landlord’s
application. A handwritten note on that letter indicated that it had been mailed on October 28, 2021, which is the
same date as that set out in the Certificate of Service for service of the N12
notice. The Moak Letter stated,
“Please be advised that your Landlord is crediting one months rent against your
several months arrears pursuant th [sic] the n12 that was served on you today.
Any questions please contact the undersigned.”
 
9.    
The Tenant did not dispute
having received the Moak Letter but asserted
that she has never been in arrears of rent. She alleged that no rent was owing as of the date of the Moak Letter, such that she has not
received the requisite one month’s compensation.
 
10.  I indicated in the hearing
that I was prepared to accept the Moak Letter
as the Landlord’s written notice of waiver of one months rental
arrears from the period prior to the December 31, 2021 termination date if I
were to find that it was more likely than not that at least one month’s rent
was in fact owing as of the date of the Moak Letter.
 
11.  The Tenant testified that, prior to the Landlord’s
purchase of the unit, her rent had been paid
directly by the Ontario Disability Support Program (‘ODSP’)
to the previous landlord.
She did not find out about the present Landlord’s purchase of the until the end
of September 2020, after arrangements
had already been made for ODSP to send the rent for October 2020 to the
previous landlord.        VP testified that she explained this situation to the
Landlord. The Landlord acknowledged
that he did not approach the previous Landlord for payment of the rent for
October 2020.
 
12.  The Tenant testified that when she contacted ODSP to
remit the rent funds to the Landlord, she was unable to provide ODSP with the required contact
information for the




 
new Landlord. As a result, ODSP began remitting the rent funds
directly to the Tenant for the Tenant to provide payment to the
Landlord. The Tenant testified that
she received funds from ODSP in this regard at the end of October
and November 2020. She paid the
rent for November 2020 in cash to a man who appeared at the unit to collect the
rent.
She did not know who this man was but presumed
that he was collecting the rent on behalf of the Landlord and felt
intimidated into paying. She
requested, but did not receive, a receipt for this payment.
 
13.  VP testified that she herself provided the Landlord
with cash payment for the December 2020 rent at some point in December
2020 when the Landlord came to the unit. She was
not provided with a receipt for that rent.
 
14.  The Tenant testified that she understood that ODSP
had, by January 2021, received contact information from the Landlord
and that ODSP began remitting
the rent payments to the Landlord directly as of
the beginning of January 2021.
 
15.  The Landlord testified that he did not receive any
rent for October, November or December 2020 or for January 2021. I find, on the basis of the Tenant’s
uncontroverted testimony, that ODSP paid the rent for October 2020 on behalf of
the Tenant to the previous landlord. The Tenant
effectively paid that rent and the
Landlord must look to the previous landlord for recovery for
those funds should he choose to do so. The
question of payment of cash rent for the months of November and December 2020
remained in dispute. The Tenant did
not provide any bank statements or other supporting documentation about the two
cash payments, but indicated that the funding for those cash payments had come
from the ODSP deposits into her account.
 
16.  There is no question that the Tenant did not herself
pay rent for January 2021. She
understood that ODSP had already made that payment on her behalf as of the
beginning of January 2021. She could not
say whether ODSP had deposited
funds into her account
at the end of December 2020, as it had for the end of each of October and
November 2020.
 
17.  The Tenant referred, in the hearing,
to a letter dated January
18, 2022 from ODSP. That letter was sent to the Board and the Landlord during the
hearing (Exhibit 2). I had mistakenly understood, during
the hearing, that this letter had been sent to the
Tenant on January 18, 2021 as
confirmation that ODSP had, by the date of that letter, taken over payment of
rent from January 1, 2021. In light
of the fact that the letter is in fact dated January 18, 2022, I presume that the letter
was in response to a request
from the Tenant for a document to be used in this
hearing. In any event, it is not
contemporaneous with the changeover in payments from ODSP.
 
18.  The Landlord referred in the hearing to an email from
him to ODSP dated January 14, 2021 (Exhibit 3) and a letter dated
January 28, 2021 from ODSP to
him (Exhibit 4). Both of these documents were provided to
the Tenant and the Board during the hearing.
 
19.  The January 14, 2021 email from the Landlord to ODSP
referred to a telephone conversation between the Landlord and ODSP and inquired into how to have the OSDP




 
rent cheques for the Tenant
redirected to the Landlord. The
Landlord testified that this phone conversation was the first contact he had
had with ODSP in this regard. He provided, in the January 14th email, his contact information. The January 28, 2021
letter from an individual on behalf of the Director of ODSP was addressed to the Landlord. The writer stated, “I
am writing to confirm a payment arrangement under the Ontario
Disability Support Program (ODSP). Until further notice, you will receive
payment each month on behalf of [the Tenant at the address
of the unit].” The letter provided payment
details and then stated, “We
will pay you by cheque.”
 
20.  I find that it is more likely than not that the ODSP
payments did not commence until after the January 28, 2021 letter from ODSP to
the Landlord. I give more weight to
the contemporaneous communication from ODSP than to the later communication
prepared the day before the hearing of this matter. Further, the timing of the January 28, 2021 letter is consistent with the payment having been
made in response to the Landlord’s enquiry in mid-January 2021. I note that the Tenant testified that OSDP
was unable to change the direction of payment of the October 2020 rent from the
previous landlord in the circumstance where ODSP was not notified until late
September 2020. There is no indication that the Tenant or the Landlord gave any
new information about the Landlord’s proper contact information until
mid-January 2021. It is more likely
than not, in the circumstances, that the ODSP payment
in late December
2020 went to the account
of the Tenant, like the
October and November payments, rather that to the Landlord.
 
21.  I find, accordingly,
that it is more likely than not that the rent for the month of January
2021 remained outstanding as of October 2021, when the Tenant was advised by
the Moak Letter of the waiver of one month rent arrears. In that I have found that there was
at least one month’s rent arrears – being the rent for January 2021 – I need
make no finding on whether the rent was in fact paid in either of November or
December 2020.
 
22.  I find that the Landlord properly provided the Tenant
with the requisite one month’s compensation
prior to the December 31, 2021 termination date in the N12 notice
on which this application is based. The application is without defect.
 
23.  The Tenant did not contest
the Landlord’s testimony that he in good faith requires the unit
for his own residential occupation.
 
24.  VP testified that the Landlord never made the Tenant
aware that he required the unit for his own use. I was not clear on the basis for this position in that the
Tenant did not contest receiving the N12 notice of termination in October 2021. It is possible that VP meant that the
alleged failure to advise the Tenant in advance of October 2021 of his
intention should raise an inference that the Landlord does not in good faith
intend to take occupancy of the unit. I
do not accept that any such inference can be drawn in the face of the Landlord’s uncontroverted testimony about his intentions in October 2021 and now.
 
25.  VP testified that the Tenant
will have great difficulty in finding new accommodation in the
tight housing market in Cornwall. She
submitted that the Tenant has disabilities which will compromise her ability to
find new housing. The Tenant is
settled in the area and




 
does not want to move. Any displacement may well have serious emotional repercussions on the Tenant.
 
26.  I note that the Tenant has been aware of the
Landlord’s intention to take possession of the unit since not later than late
October 2021. I acknowledge that the
Tenant may have genuinely, if mistakenly, believed that there were no rental
arrears such that the Tenant expected the Landlord’s application for termination to fail, and have considered that in my determination of appropriate
termination date.
 
27.  The Landlord is entitled to possession of the unit. I note that the Landlord is still living
at the same location as he lived when he purchased the unit in September
2020. I recognize that the Tenant has
a disability which may make her finding new accommodation somewhat challenging. I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until March 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of
the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated as of March 31, 2022.
The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before March 31, 2022.
 
2.     If the Tenant
does not vacate
the unit on or before
March 31, 2022, the Tenant
shall pay the Landlord rent at
the rate of $29.59 per day from April 1, 2022 until she vacates the unit.
 
3.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 31, 2022, then starting
April 1, 2022 the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
4.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after April 1, 2022.
