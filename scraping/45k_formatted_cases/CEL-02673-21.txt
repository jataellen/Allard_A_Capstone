Curtis Nevin McKay Nicole Catherine Morris


Tenants



 
 
 
DMS Property
Management Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Curtis Nevin McKay and Nicole
Catherine Morris (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Frank Calcagni,
attended the hearing. As of 10:24 a.m., the Tenants were not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to December
31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective August 26, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
vacated the rental
unit on October 14, 2021. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $2,155.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $2,255.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
1, 2021 to August 26, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenants paid $4,305.00 after
the application was filed




File Number: CEL-02673-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of October
14, 2021, the date the Tenants returned
vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.    
As of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the Landlord is entitled to by $1,147.75*.
 
3.    
However, the Landlord is authorized to offset
$186.00, the cost of filing the application, from the amount the Landlord
owes the Tenants.
 
4.    
The Landlord or the Tenants shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a
result of this order.
