Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Sharon Harris,
attended the hearing.

Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from June 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because

unit.

for the period ending
December 31, 2021 after the application was filed.

$112.72 for the cost of filing the application.
