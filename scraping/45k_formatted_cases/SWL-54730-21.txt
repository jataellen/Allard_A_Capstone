Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-54730-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


2, 206 MONTROSE STREET SOUTH
  CAMBRIDGE ON N3H2J2


 




Between:


Rebecca Macdonald


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Cory Nagy Ryan Nagy


Tenants



 
 
 
Rebecca Macdonald
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict Cory Nagy and Ryan Nagy (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have
the Tenants pay the
rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in
the order issued by the Board on February 4, 2021 with respect to application
SWL-48608-21.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 8, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s husband, C. Van Iersel, the Landlord’s legal representative, D. Digiandomenico,
and the Tenant, C. Nagy, attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants did not meet certain
conditions specified in the order.
 
2.     The Landlord alleges
that the Tenants
did not pay $856.34 on or before
August 15, 2021, and they did not pay the rent for
September, 2021, by September 1, 2021.
 
3.    
The matter
was sent to a hearing
because the Landlord’s application was unclear
about the exact amount still owing.
 
4.    
The Landlord
said that the amount of arrears and costs owing to the end of December 31, 2021, is $16,210.58. The monthly rent is $1,092.42.
 
5.    
The Tenant said that he has not made a payment
since June 11, 2021. He therefore
admits the breach alleged by the Landlord.




 
 
 
6.    
The Tenant said that he
now has a new job, and his brother is now contributing to the rent as well. The Tenant also said that he collected the rent from his
brother, but he has
not yet paid it to the Landlord.
He said that he is working in night shift supervision in the automotive industry.
 
7.    
The Tenant said that his brother,
(the other Tenant,
R. Nagy), just returned to the rental unit this month.
 
8.    
The Tenant
offered to pay $6,210.58 by the day after the hearing, and to pay $856.34 by December 15, 2021.
 
9.    
The Tenant said that he
wants to stay in the rental unit. He
said that he did not pay rent because the Landlord had already applied for
eviction, and the Landlord is “gunning for” him. He also said that he put aside the money to pay the Landlord,
but has not yet paid it
because he did not know how the hearing would go. He submits that if he is evicted, he will need more time to find
an alternative place to live.
 
10.  The Landlord submits that the Tenants should be evicted as the arrears
are now more than $16,000.00. The Landlord submits that the Tenants have
not provided any documentary proof of jobs or income, and they have agreed to many payment
plans in the past and have
consistently failed to meet the terms.
 
11. 
I find that the Tenants have not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The
Tenants failed to pay $856.34
on or before August 15, 2021, and they
failed to pay the monthly rent
for September, 2021, on or before the first day of that month.
 
12.  The Tenants have failed to make any
payments since June 11, 2021, and their arrears are now substantially higher
than they were when the payment plan was imposed
in May, 2021. The payment plan in May, 2021, was a set
aside of a previous payment plan that was breached.
 
13.  The Tenants did not provide
any documentary evidence
of income or the ability
to pay the rent in full going forward. They have not paid any rent for six months, and their arrears
have risen higher with each subsequent L4 application by the Landlord. The arrears are currently very
substantial. I find that the tenancy
is no longer viable, the Tenants have not
demonstrated an ability to pay the rent as it becomes due and owing, and I find
that the appropriate remedy is eviction.
 
14.  The previous application included a request
for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order
required the Tenants
to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
15. 
The Tenants were ordered to pay $10,276.08 for rent
arrears in Order SWL-48608-21- SA, issued on May 4, 2021, and amended on May 12, 2021. That amount is still owing, and the amount currently owing to
January 6, 2022, is $16,426.10. That
amount is




 
included in this order. As a result, the previous order SWL-48608-21-SA, issued on May 4, and amended on May 12, 2021, is
cancelled.
 
16.  Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from September 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.
 
17.  The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,092.42 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
18.  Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
1, 2021 to January 6, 2022.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Order SWL-48608-21-SA, issued on May 4, and amended on May 12, 2021, is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 17, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $15,332.58*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January
6, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $35.92
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 7, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
17, 2022, the Tenants will start
to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from
January 18, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January
18, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 18, 2022.
