Abed Turjuman and Hanne Bahsous

the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 21, 2022.

$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlords the full amount
owing on or before February
21, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
4.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 21, 2022, then starting February

file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
