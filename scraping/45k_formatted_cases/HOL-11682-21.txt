Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-11682-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


2544 ROSEDROP PATH OSHAWA ON L1L0L2


 




Between:


Mohammad Kamran
  Jafri


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


And Occupants Mohammad Alaa Hammad


Tenants



 
 
 
Mohammad Kamran Jafri (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict And
Occupants and Mohammad Alaa Hammad (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord
requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard in
Passcode: 956 0593 7653# on February 1, 2022.
The Landlord, represented by Paul Mitchell, and the Tenant
Mohammad Alaa Hammad,
attended the hearing.
 
The Landlord and his representative left the hearing
shortly after the hearing commenced.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The N12 notice
to terminate the tenancy has a termination date of July 31, 2021.
 
2.    
The tenancy agreement submitted
by the Tenant shows that the agreement
was for a two-year period ending on August 31,
2021.
 
3.    
Section 48 of the Residential Tenancies Act requires that the termination date be the last
day of a term. The Tenant testified
that the agreement is the original and the terms agreed to by the parties.
 
4.     I find the notice
does not meet the requirements of the Act and is therefore defective.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
