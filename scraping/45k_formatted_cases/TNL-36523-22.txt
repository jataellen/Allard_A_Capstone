File Number: TNL-36523-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


1901, 105 HARRISON GARDEN BOULEVARD
  TORONTO ON M2N0C3


 




Between:


K&g Oakburn Apartments I Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Chad Pillay Paula
Young


Tenants



 
 
 
K&g Oakburn Apartments I Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Chad Pillay and Paula Young
(the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because
the Tenants failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on November 29, 2021 with
respect to application TNL-34034-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants
have not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The
Tenant failed to pay $1,405.00 towards the arrears, on or before December 21,
2021. The Tenant failed to pay the lawful monthly rent in full, on or before
January 1, 2022.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order
required the Tenants
to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenants were ordered to pay
$15,851.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
TNL-34034-21. The amount
that is still owing from that
order is $15,851.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order TNL-34034-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenants
have failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,595.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from February
1, 2021 to January 24, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TNL-34034-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 4, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $15,303.56*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January
24, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the previous
application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $85.32
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 25, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
4, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 5,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 4, 2022, then starting February
5, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 5, 2022.
