Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-99288-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


7 BARTHOLOMEW STREET BROCKVILLE ON K6V2R2


 




Between:


Frankware
  Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


William Mundell


Tenant



 
 
 
Frankware Inc (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict William Mundell (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on August 11, 2021 with respect to
application EAL-88183-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.     The Landlord’s evidence
is that, on or about January 25, 2022 upon inspection of the unit it was noted that there was excessive
amount of materials stored in the basement including an accumulation of
combustible discarded materials, bicycles and tools.
 
3.    
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order:
 
2. The Tenant shall be permitted
to own and store a maximum of five (5) bicycles
for his own personal use and/or collection in the back yard of the residential
complex at any given time. The bicycles shall be stored together in a
designated part of the yard and in a manner that is not unsightly or haphazard.
 
4. The Tenant shall not store
or accumulate any bicycle parts,
tools, or equipment incidental to bicycle repair,
or any bicycles that are not for his personal use as described in paragraph 2,
above, on the residential property.
 
5. The Tenant shall not store any
discarded items intended for disposal or which have no practical use on the residential property
but shall properly
dispose of these items within 7 days in accordance by
the methods required by municipal bylaws.




 
 
 
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$175.00 for and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
EAL-88183-20. The amount
that is still owing from that order
is
$175.00 and that amount is
included in this order. As a result,
the previous order EAL-
88183-20 is cancelled.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order EAL-88183-20 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before March 1, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $175.00.
This amount represents the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application that have not been paid.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $23.67 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 19, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing on or before March 1, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 2, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 1, 2022, then starting March 2, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
