Between:

Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Andy Traynor
  Gail Traynor


Tenants



 
 
 
Edith-ann Shantz and Jacob
Mcmaniman (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Andy Traynor and Gail Traynor
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
way of video conference on January 10, 2022.
The Landlord’s attended the hearing
and were represented by Cassandra Weatherston, Paralegal. The Tenant’s attended the hearing an were
self represented.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective September 22, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $900.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
3.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from July 18, 2021 to
September 22, 2021.
 
4.     The parties agreed
that as of the date of the hearing the Tenants owed to
the Landlord
$4,686.00 which includes $4,500.00 in rent arrears
and $186.00 for the costs
of filing the application.
 
5.     The parties were previously before the Board on an L2
application based on an N12 notice of termination. The parties consented to a termination date of March 31, 2022.




File Number: CEL-02909-21
 
6.    
Both Tenants are on disability and not in a financial
position to pay the rent arrears owing. The Tenants requested that the
Board delay termination until March
31, 2022 as they are currently looking for a new rental unit.
 
7.     The Landlord opposed
the Tenants request
to delay the eviction stating
that the Tenants have made no good faith payments
since August 2021.
 
Relief from
eviction:
 
8.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including the impact
of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until March 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
9.     The Tenants have resided in the rental unit for
approximately 11 years and the parties have
already agreed to a termination date of March 31, 2022 on a previous Board order.
Further, the Landlord is holding a last month’s rent deposit which will be
applied against the rent owing for the month of March 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 31, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $5,059.70*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 18, 2022,
less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $29.59 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 19,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing* on or before March 31, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from April 1, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 31, 2022, then starting
April 1, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after April 1, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to
void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlords or to the Board in trust:




File Number: CEL-02909-21
 
i)               
$6,486.00 if the payment
is made on or before February 28, 2022, or
ii)             
$7,386.00 if the payment
is made on or before
March 31, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not make full
payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline,
then the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after
April 1, 2022 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenants are only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlords.
