File Number:
TET-11761-20




 
In the matter
  of:


 
302, 76 LIBERTY STREET
S BOWMANVILLE ON L1C2N7


 




Between:


Tom St. Denis


Tenant




 


 
and


 




 


Dillon Smith


Landlord



 
 
 
Tom St. Denis
(the 'Tenant') applied for an order determining that Dillon Smith
(the 'Landlord') harassed, obstructed, coerced,
threatened or interfered with the Tenant and entered
the rental unit illegally.
 
This application was scheduled by videoconference on October 26, 2021, 9am.
 
Only the Tenant attended
the hearing as of 10:37
am although the notice of hearing was properly
sent to the Landlord.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Tenant produced a text
message from the Landlord
on February 26, 2020
indicating that he would
be entering the unit with a contractor on or about February
28, 2020 10am.
2.       
The Landlord was bound to provide
written notice.
 
3.       
The Tenant provided video evidence of aggressive behaviour from the Landlord. The Tenant called the Police to attend
his unit. The Police
permitted the Landlord
and his contractor to complete bathtub repairs.
4.       
On or about February
29th at
midnight, the Tenant
found the superintendent, at the direction of
the Landlord, in his unit.
5.       
The Tenant no longer occupies the rental unit.




 
 
6.       
The Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “RTA”) states as follows:
 
Entry with notice
 
27 (1) A landlord
may enter a rental unit in accordance with written notice given to the
tenant at least 24 hours before the time of entry under the following
circumstances:
 
1.    
To carry out a repair or replacement or do work in the rental unit.
 
 
7.       
Section 191 of the RTA provides
that a notice is sufficiently given under the RTA if it is
done so in accordance with the
Board’s Rules. Rule 3.1h allows for service via email if the recipient has consented to it
service by email.
8.       
I find that
the Tenant has established two illegal
entries. First, assuming without deciding that a text message constitutes
an email within the meaning of the Rules, I heard no evidence that the
Tenant consented to service by email, as required by Rule 3.1h. As such, I find that the text message notice
of entry sent on February
26 did not comply with
s. 27, and thus
the subsequent entry was illegal. I note that the Tenant was essentially given 24 hours of actual notice of the entry for a legitimate purpose, however that speaks
more to remedy than it does to whether there was a breach.
9.       
I further find
that the February 29 incident at midnight also constitutes an illegal entry. I
accept the Tenant’s uncontradicted evidence that the Landlord did not provide
24-hour written notice for the Superintendent’s entry. Moreover, while s. 26(1) of the RTA allows an entry without notice in cases
of emergency or where the tenant consents, there was no evidence supporting a
finding that either of these circumstances apply.
10.   
The illegal entry
of a rental unit is a breach of privacy. The leading case with respect to
breach of privacy is Wrona v. Toronto Community Housing Corp.,
[2007] O.J. No. 423 (Ont. Div. Ct.). In that case the Tenant was provided with
notice but the notice failed to meet the mandatory
requirements of the RTA. The Court awarded
the tenant $1,000.00




 
for a single illegal
entry. While I heard no evidence of any history
of illegal entries,
as was the case in Wrona,
this matter involves two illegal entries. Moreover, I accept that finding the
Superintendent in his unit at midnight would have had a negative impact on the
Tenant. In my view, this is an
appropriate amount in the circumstances.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The Landlord
shall pay to the Landlord
and Tenant Board
an administrative fine in the amount of $1000.00 by March 15, 2022.
2.       
The Landlord shall pay the Tenant
$1000.00 by March 15, 2022.
 
 
 
February 16, 2022
