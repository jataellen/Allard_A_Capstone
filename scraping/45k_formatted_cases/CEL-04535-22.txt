Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-04535-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


728, 3420
MORNING STAR DRIVE MISSISSAUGA ON L4T1X9


 




Between:


Capreit Limited Partnership


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Avijit Mukherjee


Tenant



 
 
 
Capreit Limited Partnership
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Avijit Mukherjee (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent he owes because the Tenant failed to meet a
condition specified in the order issued by the Board on August 16, 2021 with
respect to application CEL-96500-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The original
order was issued by the Board on August
16, 2021, and was amended on February 7, 2022. The
amendment renders the original order invalid.
 
3.     As the L4 application is based on Board order CEL-96500-20 issued on August 16, 2021, which has subsequently been amended,
the application based on this order must be denied.
 
4.     The Landlord may wish to file a new L4 application based on the amended order.




File Number: CEL-04535-22
 
It is
ordered that:
 
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
