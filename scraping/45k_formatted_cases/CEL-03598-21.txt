In the
  matter of:

Tenants



 
 
 
and Baljinder
Kaur Braich, Gurdip
Singh Braich, Sajjan
Singh Gill and Jaswant Singh Grewal (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Gerald Brian Blakley, Alexandrea Noelle
Luckhart and Beauvais Jennifer Anne (the 'Tenants') because they or another
occupant of the rental unit have committed an illegal act or have carried out,
or permitted someone to carry out an illegal trade, business or occupation in
the rental unit or the residential complex.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 956 0593
7653# on February 10, 2022. The Landlord, represented by Amandeep Singh Gill, and the Tenant Beauvais Jennifer
Anne and Gerald Brian
Blakley, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord served an N6 notice alleging the Tenants committed an illegal act.
 
2.     The Landlord claims the Tenants had an open-air fire
in the backyard. The Tenants
acknowledge this occurred and testified that it was a mistake. They testified that they have two authorized fire pits, but their permits
had expired. A friend was helping dispose of items, lit the fire, and was
told to put it out by the Tenants. The
fire was not fully extinguished, and the fire department issued a $156.78 fine
to the Landlord.
 
3.     Board Guideline 9 provides guidance on an illegal act
notice. An illegal act must be a
serious violation of a federal,
provincial or municipal
law and must be serious
to warrant eviction. An illegal act will be serious if it has the potential to affect the character of
the




File Number: CEL-03598-21
 
premises or to disturb
the reasonable enjoyment of the landlord
or other tenants.
The seriousness of this ground can be seen in the fact the notice cannot
be voided.
 
4.     Considering this guidance, I find the illegal act
described by the Landlord in not serious and
did not affect
the character of the premises
or to disturb the reasonable enjoyment of the
landlord or other tenants.
 
5.     As such, the Landlord’s application must be dismissed.
 
6.     At the hearing
the Tenants agreed
that should pay the fine the Landlord
incurred and would pay the fine
by the end of the month. This will be
ordered.
 
7.     As the Landlord’s application is dismissed, the cost will not be ordered as the application was not successful.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$156.78.
 
2.     The Landlord has the right to collect
the full amount at any time after
February 28, 2022.
