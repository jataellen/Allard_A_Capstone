Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-33522-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


BASEMENT / 1 BED, 18 WILCLIFF COURT MARKHAM ON L6E2E5


 




Between:


Kasthury Thiruchelvam
Watson Property Management Ltd


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Laurielle Charlotte Harris


Tenant



 
 
Kasthury Thiruchelvam and Watson Property
Management Ltd (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Laurielle Charlotte Harris (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 18, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Thirusenthuran Sivapatham attended the hearing.
The Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from April 1, 2021 to October
31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective July 18,
2021.
2.    
The Tenant
is in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is
$1,200.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
is not holding a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.    
The Tenant
paid $500.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order
as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 18, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlords $10,634.99*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 7, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords
$39.45 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 8, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount
owing* on or before January
18, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 19, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January
19, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after January 19, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 18, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $11,686.00** to the Landlords
or to the Board in trust, this order for
eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after January
19, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
