Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-11948-21
 



In the matter
of:


2886 DOYLE DRIVE LONDON ON N6M0G7


 




Between:


Shilpa Jain Hemant
Kumar


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


 


Tenants




 


Annabell
Shimansky Michael Almeida


 



 
 
 
Shilpa Jain and Hemant Kumar (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Annabell Shimansky and Michael
Almeida (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 16, 2021. The Landlord, Shilpa
Jain, attended the hearing.
As of 2:07 p.m., the Tenants were not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from July
1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because of the arrears,
the Landlords served a Notice
of Termination effective September 1, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $2,250.00.
 
4.    
The Tenants
have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlords’ attempts
at negotiating a repayment agreement
were unsuccessful.
 
6.    
The Landlords collected
a rent deposit of $2,250.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being
held by the Landlords.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent
deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from May 11, 2020 to December
31, 2020.




 
8.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenants, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act. The amount outstanding is
substantial, and the Tenants have not paid any rent since the application was
filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 17, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to
the Landlords $11,686.29*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 6, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also
pay to the Landlords $73.97 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting January 7, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before January 17, 2022, the
Tenants will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 18, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January 18, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after
January 18, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 17, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $15,936.00** to the Landlords
or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or
after January 18, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenants are only
entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlords.
