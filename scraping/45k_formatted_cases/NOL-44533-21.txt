In the matter of:      2, 1448 MARCEL
STREET

Between:                  Sara Humber                                    Landlord
 
 
and
 




Marja Gravel Rick Gravel


Tenants




 
 
 
Sara Humber (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Rick Gravel
and Marja Gravel (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 10, 2022.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant, Rick Gravel, attended
the hearing on behalf of the Tenants.
The Tenant spoke with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required
to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to February 28,
2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective November 25, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the lawful monthly
rent is $876.85.
 
4.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $876.85
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     The Tenants paid $4,339.25 after the application was filed.
 
6.     The parties agree that the amount outstanding to February 28, 2022, inclusive of rent
arrears ($2,581.85), and costs ($186.00), is $2,767.85.




 
7.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
8.    
The Tenant proposed a payment plan that would
have the arrears
paid by April 30, 2022. Although the Tenant breached a
previous payment agreement with the Landlord, the Tenants have made payments
reducing the arrears by almost half of what was originally claimed when the
application was filed. Given the remedial purpose of the Act and the Tenants’
good faith payments, the Tenants’ proposed payment plan is granted.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$2,767.85, which represents the arrears of rent
($2,581.85), and costs ($186.00) outstanding for the period ending February 28,
2022.
 
2.     The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenants
is denied on the condition
that:
 
(a)  
The Tenants shall make the following
payments to the Landlord in respect of the monies owing under paragraph 1 of
this order:
 



Date Payment Due


Amount of Payment




March 4, 2022


$1,000.00
(costs and
  arrears)




April 1, 2022


$1,000.00
(arrears)




April 30,
  2022


$767.85
(arrears)



 
(b)  
The Tenants shall also pay
the Landlord the rent for the months of
March 2022 up to and including April 2022 in full, on or before
the first business day of each corresponding month.
 
3.     If the Tenants
fail to make any of the payments
in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates required, then:
 
(a)  
The Landlord may apply under
section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an
order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, and for the payment of
any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not already ordered under paragraph 1
of this order. The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a
breach of a condition set out in paragraph 2 of this order.




 
(b)  
The balance owing under paragraph
1 of this order shall become payable on the day following the date of default.
The monies owing shall bear interest
at the post-judgment interest
rate determined under subsection 207(7) of the Act.
