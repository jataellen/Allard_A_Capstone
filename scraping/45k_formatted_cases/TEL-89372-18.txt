C.L.P. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict T.L. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.  This is an L1 application.
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because she has been persistently late in
paying her rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date.  This is an L2 application.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on April 23,
2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, G.P.,
and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent he was required to pay for the period from December 1, 2017 to April
30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective February 22, 2018.
2.     
At the commencement of the
hearing the parties had come to a consent regarding the arrears and
persistently late rent.  
3.     
As I was verifying the terms
of the consent the Tenant stated she no longer wished to have a consent and
requested a hearing.  
4.     
The application was stood
down and upon bring the application forward again it was established the
parties were both in agreement to keep the payment of arrears of rent to be
paid on or before May 15, 2018.  For this reason, this portion of the order is
on consent.
APPLICATION FOR PERSISTENTLY LATE RENT
5.    
The Tenant has persistently
failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
6.    
It is clear the Tenant
agreed she had been paying her rent late.  She stated that she did not believe
she could make the payment on the first day of every month.  The problem with
this is that the lease requires payment on the first day of each month.  
7.    
The Tenant said that her
pension comes in on the first day of the month; however, May 2018 was the first
monthly payment she would be receiving.  The Tenant also did not provide any
documentation which shows when the pension payments would be made to her
account.  She said she was not sure she would be able to get the money to the
Landlord when the banks are closed.  
8.    
The Board cannot change the
lease between the parties.  The rent is due on the first day of each month. 
However, in order to provide the Tenant appropriate time to pay the Landlord it
is ordered the Tenant must pay on or before the first business day of the
month.  
9.    
The Landlord notified the
Board that they do not wish to have this portion of the order on consent and it
is noted.  I fail to see any prejudice to the Landlord to allow the payment on
the first business day of each month.
10.  That being said, an order for payment on time
for 12 consecutive months shall issue.  After the order is complete the
Tenant’s monthly rent will be due and owing on the first day of every month. 
11.  I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. 
12.  This order contains all of the reasons for the
decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $200.81 for arrears of rent to April 30, 2018 and costs.
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord the amount set out above in paragraph 1 on or before May 15, 2018.
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay
the monthly rent on or before the first business day of every month beginning
May 1, 2018 until April 1, 2019. 
4.    
If the Tenant fails to make
any one of the payments in accordance with this order, the outstanding balance
of any arrears of rent and costs to be paid by the Tenant to the Landlord
pursuant to paragraph 1 of this order shall become immediately due and owing
and the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to the Board pursuant
to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenant and requiring that the Tenant pay any new arrears, NSF fees and related
charges that became owing after April 30, 2018.
