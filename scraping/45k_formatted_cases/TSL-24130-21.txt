Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-24130-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


212, 75 EASTDALE AVENUE EAST YORK ON M4C5N3


 




Between:


Capreit Limited Partnership


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 


Tenants




 


Briana Hidalgo-Diaz Joseph Rossi Meisha Hidalgo-Diaz Shaheed Ali


 



 
 
 
Capreit Limited Partnership (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Briana Hidalgo-Diaz, Meisha Hidalgo-Diaz, Joseph Rossi and Shaheed Ali (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Nidi Sharma
attended the hearing.
As of 2:47 p.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to December
31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective September 2, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,750.00.
 
4.     
The Tenants
paid $700.00 after
the application was filed.
 
5.     
The Landlord’s attempts at negotiating a repayment agreement
were unsuccessful.
 
6.     
The Landlord
is not holding a last month's rent deposit.
 
7.     
The NSF cheque charges
were not substantiated. Therefore, the claim was denied.




 
8.     
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the
Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant and find
that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The
amount outstanding is substantial, and the Tenants have not paid a full month’s
rent since the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated. The
Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before January 22, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $10,451.50*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 11, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $57.53 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 12, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 22, 2022, the
Tenants will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 23, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 22, 2022, then starting January 23, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
January 23, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 22, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $11,736.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or
after January 23, 2022 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant
possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
