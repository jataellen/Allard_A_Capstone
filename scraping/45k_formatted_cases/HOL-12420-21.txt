Amir Goodarzi Asma Mohajerani


Tenants




 
 
 
Payman Mostoufipoor (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Amir Goodarzi and Asma Mohajerani (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe. The
Landlord also claimed administration charges related to NSF cheques.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 1, 2022.   The Landlord and the Landlord's Legal Representative, Bita Di Lisi, attended the hearing. As of 3:38 p.m., the Tenants
were not present or represented at the hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September 21, 2021 to February
20, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October 21, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $2,050.00.
 
4.    
The Tenants
paid all arrears
for the period
ending January 31, 2022 after the application
was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord incurred charges
of $40.00 for administration charges
related to cheques tendered by or on behalf of the
Tenants, which were returned NSF.
 
6.     The
only amounts outstanding are the Landlord's $186.00 cost of filing the application
and $40.00 administration charges for the NSF cheques. As a result, the order
will be limited to these costs only
and not eviction.
