Review Order
 
2432350 Ontario
Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Kimberly Ann Fedick and Robert Victor Coxon (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe. The Landlord also applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants because the Landlord has
entered an agreement of purchase and sale, and
a purchaser in good faith
requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose
of residential occupation.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the
unit after the termination date.
 
This application was resolved by order SOL-20022-21 issued on August
5, 2021.
 
On August
16, 2021, the Tenants
requested a review of the order
and that the order be stayed
until the request to review the order is resolved.
 
On August
23, 2021 interim
order SOL-20022-21 -IN was issued,
staying the order
issued on August 5, 2021.
 
The request
was heard via video conference on November 23,
2021.
 
Harpal Sandal
on behalf of the Landlord,
and the Landlord’s legal representative, Adam Hamdani attended
the hearing. The Tenant, Robert V. Coxon (RVC) attended the hearing on behalf of the Tenants.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
For the reasons that follow, I am not satisfied that the Tenants
were not reasonably able to participate in the proceeding.
 
2.    
The Notice of Hearing
was mailed to the Tenants on June 23, 2021 and contained information about the hearing
process. The notice stated amongst
other things, what may




File Number: SOL-20022-21-RV
 
happen if the Tenants
did not attend the hearing,
and information about contacting
Tenant Duty Counsel and legal clinics, prior to the hearing.
 
3.    
The Tenant,
RVC testified that the Tenants
do not have a telephone, or a computer,
and had no means to participate at the hearing on July 28, 2021.
 
4.    
After receiving
the notice of hearing, the Tenants did not communicate to the Board or
contact a legal clinic for assistance.
 
5.    
Upon receiving the order
issued by the Board dated August 5, 2021, the Tenants took immediate steps
to contact a legal clinic
and file the review. In the review,
the Tenants stated that the
legal clinic would assist by providing a telephone for the hearing.
 
6.    
I am of the view that the Tenants did not have a genuine intention to attend the
hearing. I say this because prior to the hearing date, the Tenants failed to
take any proactive steps to either notify the Board or obtain assistance from a
legal clinic, that they required assistance to participate at the hearing. It
was only after receiving the order from the Board dated August 5, 2021, that the Tenants
contacted a legal clinic for assistance. This shows that the Tenants could have
taken these same exact steps prior to the hearing date to obtain assistance
from a legal clinic if they wanted to attend the hearing. The Tenants failed to
do so.
 
7.    
To be clear, the Tenants received
the notice of hearing, were clearly aware of the hearing
date and simply did nothing until the order was issued. I am not persuaded that
the Tenants intended to attend the hearing.
 
8.     This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The request
to review order SOL-20022-21 issued on August 5, 2021 is denied.
The order is confirmed and remains unchanged.
 
2.    
The interim
order issued on August 23, 2021 is cancelled. The stay of order SOL-20022- 21 is lifted.
