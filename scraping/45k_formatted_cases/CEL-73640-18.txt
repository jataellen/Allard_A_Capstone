Order under Section 69,
135, 30 and 31
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006











 
 

MH (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict MB (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes (L1 Application).
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because:
a)    the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the
Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage;
b)    the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the
Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with
the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord
or another tenant (L2 Application). 
 
The Tenant applied for an order determining that the Landlord:
a)   
harassed, obstructed, coerced,
threatened or interfered with them;
b)   
substantially interfered
with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the
Tenant or by a member of their household and 
c)   
withheld or deliberately
interfered with the reasonable supply of a vital service, care service, or food
that the Landlord is obligated to supply under the tenancy agreement (T2
Application).
 
The Tenant also applied for an order determining that
the Landlord has collected or retained money illegally (T1 Application). 
 
The Tenant also applied for an order determining that
the Landlord failed to meet the Landlord’s maintenance obligations under the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') or failed to comply with health, safety,
housing or maintenance standards (T6 Application).
 
This L1/L2/T1/T2/T6 application was heard in
Mississauga on April 27, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord and the
Landlord's Agent, JH attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Regarding L1 rent owing
application 
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from September 24,
2017 to May 23, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective February 13, 2018.
 
Regarding L2
application
2.     
On February 2, 2018, the Tenant was given a first
N5 Notice of Termination under section 62 and 64 of
the Act.  This N5 notice did not become void because the Tenant did not correct
the problem within the 7 day time period set out in the notice.
Damage
3.     
By breaking and removing glass panels of the
sliding shower doors, the Tenant caused wilful or negligent undue damage to the
rental unit.  The Landlord purchased the doors on March 7, 2016.  He testified
that the glass from the doors has been completely removed and he believes the
glass panels were shattered because the Tenant and others engage in violent
behaviour in the unit.  The Landlord is entitled to $559.58 for the reasonable
costs to replace the shower doors.  The Landlord submitted a receipt for the
purchase of the doors from Rona to substantiate the amount claimed.
4.     
The Landlord did not substantiate his claim for wilful
or negligent undue damage to the bathroom door, entry door and hallway window. The
testimony from the Landlord alone is not sufficient to demonstrate undue
damage. The Landlord did not provide photos or other evidence to support his
testimony.  These claims are dismissed.
Substantial
interference – noise, conduct
5.     
The Landlord testified that other tenants
complain about the Tenant’s dog barking.  He said he attended the unit a few
days ago with a handyman and heard the dog barking.
6.     
The Landlord also testified that there is
fighting and yelling at all hours of the night in the unit.  He said the
residential complex is small and quiet and other tenants have called him
several times complaining about hearing sounds of violence, hearing doors being
opened and closed loudly and yelling.
7.     
The Landlord testified that one tenant who lived
in the unit beside the Tenant for about 15 years has moved out because of the
Tenant’s conduct.  He said another tenant who has lived in the complex since
2009 is fearful of his safety.
8.     
Conduct involving fighting, yelling and opening
and closing doors late at night constitutes substantial interference with the
reasonable enjoyment of other residents.  A long term tenant has moved out
because of the conduct complained of and another long term tenant fears for his
safety.
Regarding Tenant applications
9.     
Since the Tenant did not
appear at the hearing to support their T1, T2 or T6 applications, I find that
these applications have been abandoned. 
 
 
Relief from
eviction
10.  
No circumstances were
disclosed in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act to consider relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
Landlord’s L1 and L2
applications:
 
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before May 14, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $6,194.90*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to May 3, 2018.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $27.95 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
May 4, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May 14, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from May 15,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before May 14, 2018, then starting May 15, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.

the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 15, 2018.
