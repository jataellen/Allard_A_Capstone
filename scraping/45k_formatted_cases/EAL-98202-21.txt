File Number: EAL-98202-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


422, 52 BAYSWATER PLACE KINGSTON ON K7M2C2


 




Between:


Osgoode Properties Ltd


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Maureen Gallagher


Tenant



 
 
 
Osgoode Properties Ltd (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Maureen
Gallagher (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another
tenant. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 956 0593 7653#
on January 26, 2022.
Only the Landlord’s Representative attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant did not provide
the Landlord a copy of his insurance as required under the tenancy agreement and did not void the N5 Notice of Termination within the seven day voiding period from October 7 to
October 13, 2021 as required under
section 64 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').
 
2.     The Tenant provided
confirmation of insurance
after the application was filed. The Landlord’s application for eviction
is now moot.
 
3.    
The Landlord had a reasonable
basis for filing the application having issues several letters to the Tenant on May 25, June 1 and June 22, 2022 before filing the L2 application on October 18, 2021. As such,
the Tenant owes the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of the application.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.




File Number: EAL-98202-21
 
2.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before
February 12, 2022, the Tenant will
start to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from February 13, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
