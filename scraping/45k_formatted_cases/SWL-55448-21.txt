Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: SWL-55448-21
 



In the
  matter of:


51, 50 MELANIE DRIVE AYLMER ON N5H3G7


 




Between:


Darlene Harder


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Elena Abrams
  Johny Abrams


Tenants



 
Darlene Harder (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Johny Abrams and Elena Abrams (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 27, 2022. Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
As of 9:59 a.m., the Tenants were not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective September 3, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent is $871.00
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants paid $2,260.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on
the parties and whether the Landlords attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenants, and find that it would not be unfair to postpone
the eviction until March 15, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 15, 2022.




File Number: SWL-55448-21
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $1,002.39*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 4, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$28.64 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 5, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
15, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 16, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 15, 2022, then starting
March 16, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 16, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)          
$1,928.00 if the payment is made on or before February 28, 2022, or
ii)         
$2,799.00 if the payment is made on or before
March 15, 2022**.
If the
Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March 16, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
