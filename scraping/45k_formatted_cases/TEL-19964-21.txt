Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Lilyanne Dodic


Tenant



 
 
Hazelview Property Services Inc.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Lilyanne Dodic (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges and related administration
charges.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 19, 2022. The Landlord's Legal Representative, Sean Beard and the
Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from March 1, 2021 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 4, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     
The lawful monthly rent is $953.20.
 
4.      The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.      The Landlord incurred
charges of $15.00 for cheques
tendered by or on behalf
of the Tenant, which were
returned NSF and $60.00 for related administration charges.
 
6.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $953.20 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021
to September 4, 2021.
 
8.     
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact
of COVID-19 on the parties
and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment

agreement with the Tenant
and find that it
would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 28, 2022
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $9,001.57*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
27, 2022 and the total charges related
to {a} NSF
cheque{s}
tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $31.34
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 28, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 28, 2022, then starting
March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$10,237.76 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$11,190.96 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after March
1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
