This
amended order is issued so that the English and French versions of the order
are issued at the same time. The original
English order is amended to have the same dates
as the French order. The correction has been bolded and underlined for
ease of reference.
 
On December 22, 2022, Ottawa
Community Housing (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Marie Therese Dakane (the 'Tenant')
and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent he owes because
the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the
Board on August 10, 2021 with respect to application EAL-94899-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.    
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition(s) specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed to pay to the Landlord
$100.00 on or before December
1, 2021 towards arrears of
rent.
 
The Tenant failed to pay to the Landlord
the lawful rent on or before December
1, 2021.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.




 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$830.00 for rent arrears and NSF cheque charges and the costs related to the
Landlord's application fee in Order EAL-94899-21. The amount that is still owing from
that order is $370.00 and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous order EAL-94899-21
is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order,
the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from October 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order EAL-94899-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 26, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $886.00*.
This amount represents the rent owing up
to December 31, 2021 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $5.65 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 26, 2022,
the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated
from February 27, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated on or
before February 26, 2022, then starting February 27, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that
the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 27,
2022.

The tenant has until February
25, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion
by February 25, 2022
the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on August 27, 2022 if
the order has not been filed on or before
this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
