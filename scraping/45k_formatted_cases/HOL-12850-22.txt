Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12850-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


1002 BARTON WAY INNISFIL ON L9S0N5


 




Between:


Brian Johnson Jonielyn Olavidez


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Jermaine Duffus


Tenant



 
 
 
On January 05, 2022, Brian Johnson
and Jonielyn Olavidez
(the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jermaine Duffus (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant entered into an agreement to terminate the
tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlords and the Tenant signed an agreement to
terminate the tenancy as of January 31, 2022 and the Tenant did not move out of the rental
unit by the termination date
set out in the agreement.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 13, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 13, 2022, then starting
February 14, 2022, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after February 14, 2022.
