Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-02893-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


703, 6 SIR LOU DRIVE BRAMPTON ON L6Y4E8


 




Between:


Peel Housing Corp O/p As Peel Living


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kimberly Oglivie


Tenant



 
 
Peel Housing Corp O/p As Peel
Living (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kimberly
Oglivie (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 10, 2022. Only
the Landlord's Legal Representative, Cyrina Aska attended the hearing. As of 10:19 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
The Tenant has not paid the total
rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective August
30, 2021.
 
2.    The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    The lawful monthly
rent is $1,312.00.
 
4.   
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,210.65 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.   
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021
to August 30, 2021.
 
6.   
The Tenant paid $4,124.00
after the application was filed.
 
7.   
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties
and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the
Tenant and find that it would not be unfair
to postpone the eviction until February 28, 2022 pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
