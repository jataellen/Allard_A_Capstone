In the
  matter of:


402, 1809 LAWRENCE AVE W TORONTO ON
  M6L1E3


 




Between:


Amg Apartments Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Cherisse
Marcellin Keino Alexander


Tenants



 
 
 
Amg Apartments Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Keino Alexander and Cherisse Marcellin
(the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe
and because the Tenants have been persistently late paying rent.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 988 4914 7021# on January
6, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s representative David Ciobotaru attended the hearing.
 
The Tenant,
Cherisse Marcellin, arrived
at the hearing at 11:46am.
This was after the hearing had commenced at 9:00am, well
after this case was heard, and after the Landlord’s representative had left.
 
At the hearing
the Landlord’s representative requested that the tenancy be terminated for
persistently late payment of rent. Considering the contents of the notice I have determined that if the Tenants void the order
for non-payment of rent, relief
will be provided to preserve
the tenancy as set out below.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 25, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,862.24 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
3.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from October 1, 2018 to
August 25, 2021.
 
4.    
The Tenants
have been persistently late paying rent.




 
 
 
5.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from
eviction subject to the condition(s)
set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
Part “A”: Non-Payment of Rent
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 21, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$6,918.47*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 10, 2022, less
the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $61.22 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 11, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January
21, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from January 22,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 21, 2022, then starting January
22, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 22, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 21, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $10,252.44** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after
January 22, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.




 
Part “B”: Persistently Late Payment of Rent
 
10.  The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord the
lawful rent in full and on time for each consecutive month commencing February
2022 and continuing through January 2023.
 
11.  In the event the Tenants fail to make the
above said payment in full and on time, the entire balance of the amount set out in this Order will become
due and payable
forthwith under this Order. The
Landlord shall be entitled to apply to the Board, no later than 30 days after a breach of this Order, without notice
to the Tenants, for an Order
terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants and for any arrears that become due after the date
of this order, pursuant to Section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006.
