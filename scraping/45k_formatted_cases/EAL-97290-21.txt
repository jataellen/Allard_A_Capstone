Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-97290-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


2408, 30 MCEWEN AVENUE OTTAWA ON K2B5K8


 




Between:


Empire Holdings


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


David Kreller Paula
Desmarais


Tenants



 
 
 
Empire Holdings
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
David Kreller and Paula Desmarais (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 23, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s representative, A. Skelly, and the Tenants
attended the hearing,
but the Tenants left the conference after mediation failed.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the
total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective August 13, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,261.22 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
3.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from October 1, 2020 to August 13, 2021.
 
4.     The Tenants paid $900.00 after
the application was filed.
 
5.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
including the impact of the pandemic and whether the Landlord attempted to
negotiate a payment plan, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from
eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenants income has decreased
because of garnishment and this is expected to continue for months.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 12, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$6,469.05*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 1, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $41.46
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 2, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
12, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 13, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 12, 2022, then starting
February 13, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 13, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 12, 2022, the Tenants pay
the amount of $9,075.76** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction
will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 13, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
