Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-97632-18
 











 

B.L.H.I. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict M.C.P (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises. 
 
The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring
the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage; because the Tenant,
another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the
residential complex has wilfully caused undue damage
to the premises and/or used the rental unit or the residential complex in a
manner that is inconsistent with use as a residential premises and that has
caused or can be expected to cause significant damage. 
 
The Landlord has also applied for termination
of the tenancy because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a
person the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has seriously impaired
the safety of any person. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in
Toronto on September 7, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord’s building
superintendent, A.B (AB), and the Landlord’s legal representative, B.R,
attended the hearing.
 
I was satisfied that the Notice of
Hearing was properly sent to the parties and that there was no adjournment
request or any indication that the Tenant could not attend the hearing.
 
The hearing was scheduled for 9:30
AM.  I waited until 12:25 PM and proceeded with the hearing without the Tenant
in attendance.
 
 
Determinations:
 
L-1
 
1.     
The Landlord’s L 1
Application is based on an N4 Notice alleging that the Tenant failed to pay her
full rent for the month of July 2018.  At the hearing, the Landlord provided an
update sheet, indicating that the Tenant also did not pay her rent for the
months of August and September 2018.
2.     
Based on the uncontested
evidence of the Landlord, I am satisfied that, on a balance of probabilities,
the Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from July 1, 2018 to September 30, 2018.  
3.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,159.33 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
4.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 1, 2018 to July 20, 2018.
L-2
5.     
The Landlord’s L 2
application is based on an N7 Notice alleging that the Tenant has made false
accusations to the police about other tenants stealing from her on July 18 and
20, 2018, and that the building superintendent inspected the Tenant’s unit on
July 4, 2018, and discovered serious damage to the unit, which is estimated
would cost $2,000.00 to repair, and further that the Tenant called the Toronto
Fire Service to inspect her unit on July 23, 2018, claiming there was a yellow
chemical all over her apartment but the tests came out negative. 
Damage
6.     
The building superintendent
AB testified that he inspected the Tenant’s unit on July 4, 2018, and noticed
damages done to the unit, which he photographed.  These photographs were
submitted as evidence at the hearing.  The Landlord also submitted an estimate
from GTA Renovations to repair and restore the unit, for the cost of $2,486.00.

7.     
Based on the Landlord’s
uncontested evidence, I am satisfied that, on a balance of probabilities, the
Tenant, or someone permitted to be in the unit by the Tenant, has wilfully caused
damage to the unit, and that the Landlord will incur the cost of $2,486.00 to repair
and/or restore the unit.  
Seriously impair safety of another person
8.     
The Landlord submitted an
email from the tenants in a neighbouring unit dated July 14, 2018, complaining
of false accusations by the Tenant, complaining that the Tenant is a heavy drug
user and have suspicious individuals with her in the apartment causing concern
for their safety, and complaining that the Tenant allows her large dog to runoff
leash in the building causing them fear.
9.     
These tenants were not
called to testify as witnesses and did not provide any sworn affidavit or
declaration.  There is no police report or fire inspection report, or any
objective evidence of police or fire service involvement as a result of the
Tenant’s complaint, or that those accusations were proven false or unfounded. 
10.  
In my view, there is
insufficient evidence to satisfy the Landlord’s onus to prove that, on a
balance of probabilities, the Tenant has seriously impaired the safety of
another person in the residential complex.
S. 83 Considerations
11.  
The Tenant did not attend
the hearing, and no evidence of hardship or any other section 83 considerations
have been presented for my consideration.
12.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
13.  
Given my determination on
the L2 portion of the application, there is no opportunity to void the order
for termination by paying the arrears owing. In other words, the tenancy is
terminated on a non-voidable basis.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before October 30, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $3,290.99*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to October 25, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $38.11 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
October 26, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $2,486.00, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the
damage caused to the unit.
5.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $38.11 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from
October 26, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
6.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
7.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing on or before October 30, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
October 31, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
8.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before October 30, 2018, then starting October 31, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after October 31, 2018. The Sheriff is requested
to expedite the enforcement of this order.
10.  
Due to a potential Canada
Post strike, the Landlord must immediately give a copy of this Order to the
Tenant by: handing it to the Tenant; handing it to an apparently adult person
in the rental unit; leaving it in the Tenant’s mailbox; or, if there is no
mailbox, leaving it at the place where mail is ordinarily delivered to the
Tenant; or placing a copy of the order under the door of the rental unit or
through a mail slot in the door. 
11.  
The Landlord shall not use
regular mail, registered mail, Xpresspost or any courier service that is used
by Canada Post to deliver the Order.
