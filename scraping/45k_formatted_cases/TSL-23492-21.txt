Order under Section 68
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-23492-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


103, 219 SPADINA ROAD TORONTO ON M5R2T9


 




Between:


Annex Property Group Ltd


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Rehan Mughal


Tenant



 
 
Annex Property Group Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Rehan Mughal (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the
residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit
after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 16, 2021 at 4:43pm.
 
The Landlord’s agent, Stefania
Joy, and the Tenant attended
the hearing. The Landlord was represented by David Ciobotaru.
 
Also in attendance was the Landlord’s witness, Fina Estalilla.
 
When the matter was called, the Tenant had disconnected from the videoconference hearing.
 
I note that earlier
in the day, the Tenant
was present and had interrupted the proceedings on two
separate occasions at which point I informed the Tenant that the hearing block
had several matters and that he should remain connected until his matter was
called to be heard.
 
At approximately 11:41am, the
Tenant wrote to the Board indicating that he had disconnected, could not re-join (he had initially joined by computer)
and that “I am not interested
in anything you people are/were talking in that chat room or in the whole
video hearing.” I proceeded to hear the matter uncontested.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord’s L2 application is based on a second N5 notice of termination served to the Tenant
on May 5, 2021 with a termination date of May 20, 2021 pursuant to subsection
68(1) of the Act. In order to serve a second N5, the Landlord must have served
a valid first N5.




 
2.    
The Landlord filed with the Board
a Notice of Termination that was served to the Tenant under section
64 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
(‘First N5’) on April 22, 2021 with a termination date of May
13, 2021. The First N5 is based noise complaints received by the Landlord
between April 1 and 21, 2021.
 
3.     This First N5 indicates the Tenant has seven days from
the date receipt in which to remedy the behaviours set out in the notice.
The seven-day remedy
period was between April 22 –
April 30, 2021.
 
4.    
The Landlord did not file an
eviction application with the Board based on the First N5, as the Tenant’s
behaviour was corrected. Shortly thereafter, the Landlord served
the Tenant with a second,
non-voidable Notice of Termination under section 68 of the Act (‘Second N5’).
The Second N5 contains allegations of continued noise between May 1- 5, 2021.
 
5.     By way of background, the residential premise is a
house with nine units; the lower level consists of the Landlord’s office space. The Tenant resides
on the main floor at the back. As of the hearing date, the Tenant
remains in possession of the rental unit. The lawful monthly rent is $1,135.00.
 
LANDLORD’S EVIDENCE
 
6.    
The Landlord’s witness, Fina Estalilla (FE),
who is the property manager
of the premises, explains that part of her job responsibilities includes taking care of the tenants residing at the
premises, renting the units and preparing and serving notices to the tenants.
 
7.    
FE testified that on April 22, 2021, after she served the Tenant with the first N5,
the
Tenant’s behaviour improved. However,
in May 2021, between the 1st and the 4th of the month, the Tenant’s behaviour repeated
as he was banging and yelling at the top of his lungs, in his rental unit. FE
testified that she worked in the office below and was able to hear first-hand,
how loud the noise was that was being generated by the Tenant. She explains
that it was very hard to concentrate due to the noise. FE testified that she
was afraid and had to lock the doors to the office in fear of him coming
through.
 
8.     Because of the Tenant’s behaviour, the other residents would constantly complain
and demand that she, as the
Landlord’s agent, do something
about the noise as they were fearful of their safety. FE testified
that one of the tenants ended up moving out of their unit because of the
Tenant’s behaviour.
 
9.     The Landlord’s agent, Stefania Joy (SJ), who is the
general manager, testified that she has received several complaints about the
Tenant from neighbouring units who feel threatened and scared because the
Tenant screams all day in his rental unit. On most occasions, the police have
been called to address the noise concerns raised. The Tenant’s behaviour has only escalated since the service
of the N5 notices of termination
to the point that both her and the property manager cannot approach the Tenant
to address any concerns in fear of retaliation and hostility on his part. This
affects their ability to manage the premises on a daily basis.




 
10.  The Landlord seeks
a termination of the tenancy
and reimbursement of the application filing fee.
 
ANALYSIS
 
11.  Given all of the uncontested evidence before the Board I am satisfied
that the Tenant has substantially interfered with
the reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex by making excessive noise,
specifically by yelling and screaming between May 1-4, 2021.
 
12. 
The Landlord’s
evidence establishes that the behaviour exhibited by the Tenant specifically,
the sheer volume of the noise, has had a significant impact on the other
tenants at the premises,
including loss of rental income
from one tenant
moving out of their
unit. The Landlord
fears that other tenants will also leave as a result of the noise.
 
13. 
I find that conditional relief is appropriate where tenants acknowledge the behaviour
and are willing to take steps to change that behaviour, so the same problems do not re-occur in the future. The evidence here
does not support that conclusion, as the behaviour has only escalated since the
service of the N5 notices of termination.
 
14.  I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Landlord is unaware of any
circumstances that would justify relief from eviction.
 
15.  This order contains
all of the reasons for my decision within
it. No further reasons shall be
issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated, as of May 20, 2021.
The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before February 13, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $8,493.09 (less any amount paid by the Tenants to the Landlord
after the application was filed with the Board), which represents
compensation for the use of the unit from
May 21, 2021 to February
2, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord
owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$37.32 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from February 3, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February
13, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 14, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 13, 2022, then starting
February 14, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.




 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 14, 2022.
