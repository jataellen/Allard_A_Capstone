Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-02438-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


501, 108 EDGEHILL DRIVE BARRIE ON L4N5A3


 




Between:


Guyval Investments Inc c/o Realstar Management Partnership


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Michael Keohan Stephanie Skinner


Tenants



 
 
 
Guyval
Investments Inc c/o Realstar Management Partnership (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Michael
Keohan and Stephanie Skinner (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on December
6, 2021. The Landlord's Legal Representative, Kee Fung Anthony Ho
and the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the
period from May 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective August 6, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,974.50.
 
4.      The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,805.00 from the
Tenants and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.      Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
1, 2021 to August 6, 2021.
 
6.     
The Tenants
paid $6,409.50 after
the application was filed.
 
7.      I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including
the impact of COVID-19
on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment




 
agreement with the Tenant, and find that it
would not be unfair to postpone
the eviction until December 14, 2021 pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move
out of the rental unit on or before
January 14, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$2,646.54*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January
14, 2022, less the rent deposit
and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$64.92 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 15, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing*
on or before January 25, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 26,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 14, 2022, then starting January
15, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 15, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 14, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $5,644.00** to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that
subsection on or after January 15, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once
during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
