Denise Harnadek


Tenant



 
 
 
Amiraco Properties Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Denise Harnadek
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 20, 2022. Only
the Landlord's Legal Representative,
Jessica Lapkowski, attended the hearing. As of 2:35 p.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
25, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $716.98.
 
4.     The Tenant paid $3,584.90 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The only amount outstanding is the Landlord's cost of filing
the application. As a result, the order will be limited to
costs only and not eviction.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall make the following payments to the Landlord in respect of the monies owing under paragraph 1 of this
order:
