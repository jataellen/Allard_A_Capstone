In the matter of:      UNIT 1 / UPPER, 154 HANMER STREET
E BARRIE ON L4M6W2
 
Between:                  Property Management Barrie Inc                                    Landlord
 
 
and
 




Amanda Coady Steven Hadley


Tenants




 
 
 
On November 22, 2021, Property
Management Barrie Inc (the 'Landlord') applied in this L4 application for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict Steven Hadley and Amanda Coady (the 'Tenants') and for an order
to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants
failed to meet a condition specified in the consent order issued by the Board
on July 26, 2021 with respect to L1 application CEL-99199-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The consent order provided
that the Landlord
could apply to the Board under section
78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without
notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the
Tenants did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I find that the Tenants have not
met the following condition specified in the order: The Tenants failed
to pay $269.43 (arrears) on or before November 15, 2021. This was
a breach of paragraph 2(a) of the consent order. This L4 application was filed
within 30 days of the breach.
 
3.       
The previous L1 application included a request
for an order for the payment
of arrears of rent.
The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or
some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, in this L4
application the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.       
In paragraph 1 of the consent
order, the Tenants
agreed to pay $1,886.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the
Landlord's L1 application fee. The amount that is still owing from that order
is $808.28 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous consent order CEL-99199-21 is
cancelled.




 
5.       
On August 19, 2020 the Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,700.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being
held by the Landlord.
 
6.       
Interest on the rent deposit is
owing to the Tenants for the period from the date of collection, August
19, 2020 to the issuance
date of this order, January
4, 2022. (Interest rates were 2.2% for 2020, 0.0%
for 2021, and 1.2% for 2022.)
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The previous consent order CEL-99199-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move
out of the rental
unit on or before
January 15, 2022 (standard 11 days from the
issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
If the Tenants made any payments
to the Landlord after this L4 application was filed, those
amounts shall be deducted from the calculations below.
 
4.       
At the time this L4 application was filed in November, 2021, there was a credit
of
$905.67* owing to the Tenants when the last month’s rent deposit and interest on the
deposit were deducted from the rent arrears owed by the Tenants.
 
5.       
The Tenants owe a daily compensation rate of $55.89 per day for use of the rental unit starting December 1, 2021 to the
date they actually move out or get evicted.
 
6.       
Since it is unknown
at the time of issuing
this order when the Tenants
will actually move out or get evicted, the Landlord is
authorized to deduct the daily compensation rate of
$55.89 per day starting
December 1, 2021 from the credit owing of $905.67
until the credit is entirely
used up or the rental unit is vacated, whichever comes first.
 
7.       
The Landlord and Tenants shall pay to each other any amounts
owing as a result of this
order.
 
8.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
9.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 16, 2022.

The tenant has until January 14, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 77(6) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 14, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.
 
If you have any questions about this order,
call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.
 
In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on July 16, 2022 if the order has not been
filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that
has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
