In the matter
  of:


2, 139 ALBERT STREET E SAULT STE MARIE ON P6A2J2


 




Between:


12972344 Canada
Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Zoe Williamson


Tenant



 
 
12972344 Canada
Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Zoe Williamson (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 27, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Jane Dean, attended
the hearing. The Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period
from June 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective October 6,
2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $600.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
6.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 19, 2022.




File Number: NOL-44328-21
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4,866.25*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 8, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $19.73
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 9, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
19, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 20, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 19, 2022, then starting February
20, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 20, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 19, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $5,586.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain
in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 20, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
