Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: TNL-03911-18










 

EPI - SP (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict YP (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was
heard in Toronto on June 27, 2018.
 
The
Landlord’s representative, LC and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Section 82 claim/preliminary issue:
 
1.      This
matter was adjourned May 3, 2018 because the Tenant wished to raise issues
pursuant to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’). An interim order was issued at that time requiring the Tenant to
provide disclosure to the Landlord and to pay the monthly rent as it comes due
each month into the Board. 
 
2.      The interim
order also provided that a Member may refuse to accept or consider the Tenant’s
evidence and submissions if the Tenant did not comply.  The Tenant did not
comply with the interim order, having not paid rent for June 2018 to the
Board.  The Tenant’s disclosure while timely did not contain any particulars
about the grounds for the section 82 claim.
 
3.      As such,
the Board did not accept or consider the Tenant’s evidence and submissions
related to his section 82 claim.  The Tenant may file his own application
related to her issues if he wishes. The Tenant’s evidence related to the
arrears application was accepted and considered.
 
Arrears:
 
4.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent he was required to pay for the period from
February 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination effective March 21, 2018.
 
5.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,096.22 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2018
to March 21, 2018.
 
7.      The
Tenant paid $1,093.00 after the application was filed.
 
8.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before July 9, 2018.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,570.19*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to June 28, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $36.36 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting June 29, 2018 to the date he moves out of the unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before July
9, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from July 10, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before July 9, 2018, then starting July 10, 2018,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 10, 2018.
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, he must pay to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $3,951.28 if the payment is made on or before June 30, 2018, or
ii)       $5,067.20 if the payment is made on or before July 9, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after July 10, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
