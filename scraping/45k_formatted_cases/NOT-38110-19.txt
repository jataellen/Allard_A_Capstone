Order under Sections 30 and 31
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOT-38110-19
 
 
 
 
 
BR (the 'Tenant') applied for an
order determining that RVPI, HD and JD (the 'Landlords') failed to meet the
Landlords' maintenance obligations under the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), that the Landlords
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or
residential complex by them and that the Landlords withheld or deliberately interfered
with the reasonable supply of a vital service that the Landlords are obligated
to supply under the tenancy agreement.
 
This application was heard on June 17, 2021 in VC75 and on July 22, 2021 in Passcode 215 965
491 VC 75. The Tenant
and the Tenant’s
representative, (‘AB-S’), attended the hearing on June 17, 2021 and
only the Tenant’s representative, AB-S, attended the hearing on July 22, 2021.
 
This application is one of 16
related tenant applications against the Landlords concerning the effective shut down of a mobile
home park (the ‘Park’)
and certain maintenance and repair issues leading up to the time of the
effective shut down.
 
Refer to order NOT-33990-18-HR (the ‘Base Order’)
issued February 1, 2022, concurrently with this and the other 14 related individual Tenant
applications. That order sets out my
determinations on the liability of the Landlords pertaining to events
leading up to the Park’s closure and the availability of
remedies related to the closure itself.
 
The application under file number NOT-33990-18 was a multi-tenant T2 application brought on behalf
of fifteen tenants
identified in Schedule
1 to that order (‘Park
Tenants’), seeking relief
for the discontinuance of power to the Park. A separate T6 application and/or T2 application was brought by
each of the fifteen Park Tenants, seeking relief for the Landlords’ actions and
inactions pertaining to the Park’s water supply, the Park’s sewage system and
the effective closure of the Park. This application under file NOT-38110-19 is
one of those applications.




 
The hearing of issues common to
all of the applications, meaning common to the application under file number NOT-33990-18 and the fifteen
individual applications, proceeded to completion on July
22, 2022 in Passcode 215 965 491 VC 75 following a number of earlier
appearances.
The hearing of the Tenant’s individual issues under file number NOT-38110-19 proceeded on June 17,
2019. The procedural history is set out in the Base Order.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
As set out in the Base Order, I find that that:
 
a)    
The Landlords withheld or interfered with the provision
of electricity, a vital service;
 
b)     The Landlords failed
to repair or maintain the Park’s sewage
system, allowing problems with sewage discharges and
significant odours over a period that extends back prior to one year prior to
the Tenant’s application filing in September 2019;
 
c)      The Landlords failed
to repair or maintain the Park’s water
system such that the supply of potable water was compromised
for roughly two weeks at the beginning of March 2018 and throughout the period
June through October 2018;
 
d)     The Landlords’ failures
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the units and the Park by the Tenants,
both prior to and after October 2018; and
 
e)    
The above failures, combined with
the Landlords’ decision to cease providing all services at the Park as of October 2018, attract various
remedies, some pertaining to events leading up to the October 2018 effective closure and
pertaining to events following that effective closure.
 
2.   
The Tenant claim ed only for costs and hardship attributable to the closure
of the Park.
 
3.   
I
find the following
facts on the basis of the uncontroverted testimony of the Tenant;
 
a)     The Tenant lived at the Park for many years
before he vacated
in November 2019, more than a year after the Park
effectively closed in October 2018;
 
b)     The Tenant was affected by both the water and sewage problems
at the Park, though he did
not live close to the sewage system;
 
c)     
The months leading up to the Park’s effective closure in October
2018 were particularly
difficult for him, as his wife passed away on July 27, 2018;
 
d)     The Tenant continued
to stay at the Park after October
2018 as he had nowhere
else to go. He finally left the Park in October 2019;
 
e)    
The Tenant estimated that he
incurred $500.00 per month for the winter portion (6 months) of his stay at the Par following the October 2018 closure. His estimates for the monthly costs (he had no
receipts) were as follows:




 
 
 
(i)                
$120.00 for firewood;
 
(ii)               
$20.00 for water;
 
(iii)             
$200.00 for gas for his generator;
 
(iv)             
$80.00 for oil for his furnace;
and
 
(v)              
$80.00 for gas for his barbequie.
 
f)      
The Tenant suffered a loss of
$20,000.00 in the value of his trailer. The loss of the trailer was
particularly traumatic for him as he and his wife had spent the past four years
building up the gardens
around the trailer. He had
already purchased materials to build an addition
on the trailer which was to have been his wife’s studio,
so the loss of the trailer felt to him like losing his wife again. He was in no shape, in light of events, to
gather and keep receipts for his expenses.
 
4.   
As set out in the Base Order, I find the following with respect to remedies connected
to the closure of the Park:
 
a)    
The Tenant is not entitled to compensation for the lost value of the trailer;
 
b)     The Tenant is entitled to compensation for his reasonable out of pocket
expenses during his continued stay at the Park; and
 
c)     
The Tenant may be entitled to damages for interference with reasonable enjoyment.
 
5.    The Tenant is entitled to compensation
for his out of pocket
expenses during his continued
stay at the Park. The Tenant had no receipts to substantiate his estimated
$500.00 monthly out of pocket expenses to continue to live at the Park. While his failure to save receipts is
understandable in light of his circumstances at the time, I find that I must
discount his estimates to some extent. I
find that an estimate of $400.00 per month to continue to occupy the Park
during 6 months in the winter following the Park’s closure is reasonable. I find that the tenant is entitled to $2,400.00
for this item;
 
6.   
I
find that the Tenant is entitled to damages for interference with reasonable enjoyment. It is likely that the events
leading up to and following the Park’s closure would have been particularly trying for him in light of his wife’s recent
passing. I find that a damages
award of $1,000.00 is appropriate in the circumstances.




 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlords shall pay to the Tenant a total of $3,400.00, representing payment for the following:
 
a)     $2,400.00 in compensation for out of pocket expenses
for the 6 winter months following closure of the Park; and
 
b)     $1,000.00 in compensation for damages.
 
2.    
The Landlords shall pay the Tenant the full amount owing by March 31, 2022.
 
3.    
If the Landlords do not pay the
Tenant the full amount owing by March 31, 2022 the Landlords will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from April 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
