Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-20098-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


2, 112 BUCKINGHAM AVENUE OSHAWA ON L1G2K5


 




Between:


Caleb Amade
Royal York Property Management Inc.


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Aubrey Cottle Noreen Mclean


Tenants



 
 
Caleb Amade and Royal York Property
Management Inc. (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Aubrey Cottle and Noreen Mclean (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 2, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Andrea Geddes,
attended the hearing. As of 11:05
a.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the
Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective September 22, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,500.00.
 
4.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,500.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
5.     The Tenants paid $463.68 after
the application was filed.
 
6.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenants, and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 25, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $4,672.65*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 14, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlords
$49.32 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 15, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before February
25, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 26, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 25, 2022, then starting
February 26, 2022, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 26, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 25, 2022, the Tenants pay
the amount of $7,122.32** to the Landlords or to the Board in trust, this
order for eviction will be void. This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on
time, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 26, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during
the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
