Order under Sections 30 and 31
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNT-22784-19
 
 
 
 
 
MK (the 'Tenant') applied for an
order determining that SM (the 'Landlord') failed to meet the Landlord's maintenance obligations under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') or failed to comply with
health, safety, housing or maintenance standards.
The Tenant also applied for an
order determining that the Landlord harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with the Tenant and substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment of the rental unit or
residential complex by the Tenant or by a member of the Tenant's household.
 
This application was heard
in Passcode: 970 9167 7558# Video 117 on October
14, 2021.
 
The Tenant’s representative, the Landlord and the Landlord’s representative, RB, attended the hearing.
 
At the hearing the Tenant’s
representative requested the Board’s consent to withdraw the Tenant’s applications. The Landlord’s representative requested
that the Board award costs against the Tenant for proceeding with attendance at
the October 14, 2021 hearing. The
Landlord submitted that he had spent 2 hours unnecessarily in preparation that morning for the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    I have considered the Tenant’s request
for withdrawal in accordance with subsection
200(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 and consent to the
withdrawal of the Tenant’s applications.




File Number: TNT-22784-19
 
2.   
I
find, as follows,
that an award of costs against the Tenant is not warranted
in the circumstances:
 
a)     As noted in the Board’s
Interpretation Guideline 3 (Costs), a Member has the discretion to require that a party pay, as
costs, any preparation expenses of another party where the conduct of the party
or the party’s legal representative was unreasonable. Conduct is unreasonable if it causes undue expense or delay and includes the situation where a
party takes unnecessary steps in a proceeding;
.
b)     The Tenant’s representative acknowledged that the
Tenant’s decision to request withdrawal of the applications had come at the
last minute. However the decision was
made only that morning. The Tenant’s son was ill and the Tenant was unable to attend
the hearing. The decision to request
withdrawal was related to this circumstance. The Tenant’s representative had
tried to contact the Landlord’s but the Landlord’s representative’s voicemail
was full; and
 
c)     
I find that the late notice of the
Tenant’s intent to request a withdrawal was not unreasonable in the circumstances and did not constitute the type of behaviour which should attract an award of costs.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1. The Tenants’ applications are withdrawn.
