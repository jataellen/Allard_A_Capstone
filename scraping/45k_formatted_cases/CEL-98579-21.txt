Between:


Grey Bruce Property Rentals Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Linda
Lipka


Tenant



 
 
 
Grey Bruce
Property Rentals Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Linda Lipka (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on January 7, 2022. The Tenant and the Landlord’s agent,
Andy Timmerman, attended
the hearing. The Tenant spoke to duty counsel
prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord
served a Notice
of Termination for non-Payment of Rent (‘N4”)
on October 15, 2020 alleging
that the Tenant did not pay rent between December 1, 2018 and October 31, 2020.
The N4 claimed arrears of rent for the same period of time.
 
2.    
The N4 was served
on the Tenant on March 3, 2021. It
has a termination date of March
19, 2021 and claims the total amount of rent owing of $9,860.00. The N4 has the
following chart on page 2 to show how the Landlord calculated arrears of rent
owing:

3.    
The Landlord’s evidence at the hearing was that the Tenant paid the following amounts between December 1, 2018: and September 30, 2019:
$3,000.00, $802.00, $802.00,
$802.00, $802.00,
$802.00, $802.00, $802.00,
$802.00, , $811.73,
$811.00, $812.00,
$868.43, and $726.68. These amounts add up to $13,445.84 and not to $13,436.86. The Landlord confirmed that the rest of
the amounts indicated in the N4 were correct. The amount of rent owing by the
Tenant as of the date the N4 was served is therefore
$1934.85 and not $1943. 83 as claimed in the N4.

4.    
I gave the Landlord
multiple opportunities to review his records in order to provide an explanation
about this discrepancy between his testimony and the amount indicated in the N4. The only explanation the Landlord ultimately provided was that the arrears
in the N4 were calculated by a computer
and must be correct. I do not find
this statement to be more persuasive
that sworn testimony presented at the hearing.
 
5.    
Based on the evidence
adduced at the hearing I am not satisfied that it is more likely
than not that the N4 correctly sets out the amount of rent owing as
required by s. 59(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006. The N4 is
therefore invalid and this tenancy can’t be terminated based on this invalid
N4.
 
6.    
The Landlord
sought to withdraw
this application instead
of proceeding for arrears only. I
granted this request.
 
7.    
The application having
been withdrawn, the Board’s file is closed.
