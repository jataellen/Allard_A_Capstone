Danbar Property
Holdings II LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Veronica McDonnell (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 13, 2021. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Sharon Harris,
attended the hearing. The Tenant was
not present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice
of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from August 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective August 25, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant
vacated the rental
unit on November 5, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,244.46.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of November 5, 2021, the date the Tenant
returned vacant possession of
the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$3,968.36*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to November 5, 2021.




File Number: TNL-34678-21
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before
February 7, 2022, the Tenant will
start to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
