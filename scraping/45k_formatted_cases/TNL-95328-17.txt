Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-95328-17



 


 


 



 
 
HLH
Limited (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict TM (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on October 10, 2017, November 22, 2017, and
February 26, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representatives, GI and FD, and the Tenant attended
on all dates.  The Tenant was self-represented until February 26, 2018, when KL
appeared on her behalf.
 
At the hearing the Tenant raised the following issues pursuant to
section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'):
harassment and substantial interference with her reasonable enjoyment.  Before
she obtained legal representation, the Tenant gave oral testimony and was
cross-examined.  This limited her representative’s ability to effectively
represent her after she had effectively completed her case. It would have been
unfair to the Landlord to re-open the case 7 months into the proceedings.  The
Landlord consented to the withdrawal of the section 82 claim without prejudice
to the Tenant.  
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from July 1, 2017 to February 28, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective June 27, 2017.
 
2.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,008.86 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
3.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from December 1, 2016
to June 27, 2017.
 
4.      The
Tenant paid $7,088.02 after the application was filed.
 
5.       I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until June 30, 2018
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. The Landlord consented to a delay
of the eviction for 3 months to give the Tenant time to pay the arrears or exercise
other options.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
Tenant’s section 82 claim is withdrawn without prejudice. Unless the Tenant
voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the
Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
June 30, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,727.54*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to March 23, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $33.22 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting March 24, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before April
3, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from April 4, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before June 30, 2018, then starting July 1, 2018,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 1, 2018.
 
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $2,241.27 if the payment is made on or before March 31, 2018, or
ii)       $5,317.95 if the payment is made on or before June 30, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
 
 
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after July 1, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
