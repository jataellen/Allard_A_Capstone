Medallion
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Robert Hartery and Cody Butler
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 6, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s Legal Representative, Gail Kukor Lang, and the Tenants’ Agent, Michael
Marozsan, attended the hearing.
 
It is determined that:
 
1.    
The Tenants
have not paid $2,729.00 of the total rent the Tenants were required to pay
for the period from June 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021. Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 5, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is
$1,598.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
incurred costs of $186.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
 
5.    
The Landlord
is holding a rent deposit
of $1,596.99.
 
6.    
The amount
outstanding to January
31, 2022, inclusive of rent arrears,
and costs, is
$8,475.50.

8.    
The Landlord’s Legal Representative did not consent
to the plan as she was instructed by the Landlord to request a standard order from the board.
 
9.    
However, I decided to
allow the Tenants the opportunity to remain in their rental unit providing they paid the Landlord all the payments
in their repayment plan as promised.
 
10.  This order contains
all of the reasons in this matter
and no further reasons will be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenants
shall pay the Landlord $8,475.50, which represents the arrears of rent and costs outstanding for the period
ending January 31, 2022.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s application for eviction
of the Tenants is denied
on the condition that:
 
(a)  The Tenants shall pay the Landlord $1,000.00 on or before
January 20, 2022.
 
(b)  The Tenants shall pay installments of $1,000.00 on
or before the 15th of the month
for the seven (7) month period commencing February 15, 2022 to August
15, 2022.
 
(c)  The remaining balance
of $475.50 shall
be paid on or before
September 15, 2022.
 
(d)  The Tenants shall pay the Landlord the monthly rent for the months of February 2022 to September 2022 in full and by the first
day of each corresponding month.
 
3.    
If the Tenants fail to make any of the payments
in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates required then:
 
(a)  The Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”) for an order terminating
the tenancy and evicting the Tenants and for the payment of any new arrears of
rent and NSF charges not already ordered under paragraph 1 of this order. The
Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a breach of a condition
set out in paragraph 2 of this order.
 
(b)  The balance owing under paragraph
1 of this order shall become payable
on the day following the date of default. The monies owing shall bear
interest at the post-judgment interest rate determined under subsection 207(7)
of the Act.
