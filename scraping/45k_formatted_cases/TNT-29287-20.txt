Howard Brice Jr.


Landlord



 
David Lance (the 'Tenant') applied for an order determining that Howard Brice
Jr. (the 'Landlord') failed to meet the Landlord's maintenance obligations under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') or failed to comply
with health, safety, housing or maintenance standards.
 
This application was heard via video/teleconference on October 14, 2021.
 
The Tenant, the Tenant's
Legal Representative Caryma Sa’d,
the Landlord and the Landlord's Legal Representative Robert Leck
attended the hearing.
 
A Case Management Hearing
(CMH) was held February 01, 2021, the parties were unable to resolve the issues in the applications
and the matters were directed to a full merit hearing.
 
Background and Determinations:
 
1.     The residential complex
comprises of 4 rental units located in a rural country setting.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Tenant and the former Landlord Howard
Bruce Sr commenced July 1, 2017. The Tenant
previously occupied a rental unit on the upper level and relocated to a lower
main floor unit in the fall of 2019.
 
3.     The Tenant testified
that shortly after
moving into the rental unit he began to experience problems with the property
septic system.
 
4.     The issue to be determined by the Board is whether
the Landlord(s) failed to comply
with subsection 20(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
with respect to the ongoing septic and water leakage problems through the
ceiling of the rental unit.
 
5.    
The other issue to be determined is on awarding
remedies that span a time frame that goes beyond the one-year period
preceding the filing of the Tenant’s Application.
 
6.     Subsection 29(2) of the Act imposes a one-year limitation period on the remedies
available to the Tenant, calculated from the date the Tenant filed the
application.




 
7.    
The pertinent sections of the Act are sections
29, 30 and 31. Subsection 29(1) sets out
the grounds for tenants’
applications. Subsection
29(2) sets out the time within which
the Tenant can bring the application.
 
8.     Subsection 29(2) reads
as follows:
No application may be made under subsection (1) more than one year after the day the alleged
conduct giving rise to the application occurred.
 
9.     The Tenant filed the application on November 19, 2020, the Board has no jurisdiction to consider losses arising
prior to November 20, 2019, therefore remedies being claimed before November
20, 2019 are considered statue-barred.
 
10.  Subsection 29(2) sets out a one-year limitation period
for bringing an application under subsection 29(1). If a single event or one
occasion of an ongoing event occur within the one-year limitation period, the application may proceed. This subsection does not contain any limitation on the remedy
available, when the application is brought in time. Once the application is
brought in time, the potential remedy may include the entire period that the
condition existed. The bringing of the application and the remedies available
under section 30 and 31 of the Act are distinct. Once the application is
brought in time, subsection 29(2) does not play a role in the assessment of the
remedy.
 
11.  Sections 30 and 31 set out remedies
for breach of section 29(1).
Section 30 sets out the remedies when there has been a
failure to maintain the premises in a good state of repair. Section 31 provides
remedies for the other grounds set out in subsection 29(1).
 
12.  There is nothing
in sections 30 and 31 limiting the remedies to one year prior to bringing
the application. The remedies available in sections 30 and 31 are separate and
distinct and are not limited by the limitation period set out in subsection
29(2).
 
13.   The limitations on the remedies
available to the tenants under sections 30 and 31 are as follows:
 
Subsection 30(2) provides that when
determining the remedy available to the Tenant, the Board shall consider
whether the tenant
advised the landlord
of the alleged breaches before
applying to the Board.
 
14.  In the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 damages, or
rather remedies, are contained in sections 30 and 31, not in subsection 29(2), so subsection 29(2) does not limit the award
of remedies, only the commencement of an application.
 
15.  In addition, when addressing the interpretation of
subsection 29(2), it is important to consider the purposes of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 and the principles of statutory interpretation. According
to the principles of statutory interpretation, statutes should be interpreted as being remedial
and should be given
such fair, large and liberal interpretation as best ensures
the attainment of its objects.




 
16.  The objects of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 are set out in section 1 of the Act,
which reads as follows:
 
The purposes of
this Act are to provide protection for residential tenants from unlawful rent
increases and unlawful evictions, to establish a framework for the regulation of residential rents, to balance the rights and
responsibilities of residential landlords and tenants and to provide for the
adjudication of disputes and for other processes to informally resolve
disputes.
 
17.  Therefore, when applying subsection 29(2), it is
important to give that provision an interpretation that best achieves the
remedial goals of the legislation and balances the rights and responsibilities
of landlords and tenants. If there is any ambiguity or doubt about the meaning of the legislation, it must be resolved in favour of the benefits
seeking person the legislation was meant to protect.
 
18.  The Tenant submitted
extensive narrative statements as part of his application that in part had no barring to the maintenance
issues that impacted the reasonable enjoyment that related to his unit.
 
19.  The Tenant submitted a number of photographs taken within his rental unit and of the
residential complex and property.
 
20.  The Tenant in his earlier testimony stated he began to
experience problems with the property septic system
shortly after moving into the rental unit in 2017, and that he had a
good relationship with the former Landlord
Howard Bruce Sr who is now deceased
as of January 30, 2018.
 
21.  The Tenant acknowledged that the former Landlord
Howard Bruce Sr attempted on a number of occasions to remedy the septic and water
leakage problems by having the property maintenance person
(aka handyman) Ron Lawrence complete
the plumbing and carpentry work, that in the opinion
of the Tenant was poorly completed and did not solve or repair the problem.
 
22.  The Tenant further testified that immediately after
the former Landlord Howard Bruce Sr died his son Howard Bruce Jr to whom
inherited the property was made aware of the ongoing septic and water leakage problems,
to no avail, as illustrated by the photographs submitted.
 
23.  The Tenant purported
that for most of 2020 he could not flush the toilet due to the septic pump and system problems despite
that the holding tanks were being pumped out, and that the lingering and
constant ‘foul’ septic smell within the unit made the unit unfit and inhabitable.
 
24.  After the threat of having the Ministry of Health
conducting an inspection the Landlord had a new septic bed installed on April 24, 2020. Despite
the new septic bed installation, the unit plumbing continues
to malfunction.




 
25.  The Tenant raised
other non-repair issues
with respect to maintenance matters
yet resolved by the Landlord.
 
26.  Subsection 20(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the ‘Act’) provides that a landlord is responsible for providing and
maintaining a residential complex, and the rental units in it, in a good state
of repair and fit for habitation and for complying with health, safety, housing
and maintenance standards.
 
27.  Timeliness of Landlord’s response depends on a great number of factors, but principally
on the seriousness of the state of non-repair and its possible effects on the
tenants.
 
28.  All in all, based on the totality of the testimonies
given and the evidence submitted by both parties, on a balance of
probabilities, I find that the Landlord failed to meet the Landlord's obligations under subsection 20(1)
of the Act to repair
and maintain the rental
unit to comply with health, safety, housing and property maintenance standards
.
 
29.  The order contains
all the reasons for the decision within
the order. No other reasons
will be issued.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord shall pay to the Tenant
a rent abatement of $7,200.00.
 
2.     The landlord shall
also pay to the Tenant
$50.00 for the costs of the application fee.
 
3.    
The total amount the Landlord owes the Tenant is $7,200.00. 4.
5.     The Landlord shall pay the Tenant the full amount
owing** by February
15, 2022.
 
6.    
If the Landlord does not pay the
Tenant the full amount owing by February 15, 2022 the Landlord will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 16, 2020
at 2.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
 
7.     If the Landlord does
not pay the Tenant
the full amount owing
by February 15, 2022, the Tenant may recover this amount by deducting
either from the rent each month should
he still occupy the rental unit or deduct the amount owing from arrears
of rent that have not been paid under application TNL-30542-21 issued
subsequent to this order.
 
8.     The Tenant has the right,
at any time, to collect
the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
