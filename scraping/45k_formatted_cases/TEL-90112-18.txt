Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-90112-18
 











 
 
 

H.H.L.(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict A.T. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes. (L1 application)
 
H.H.L.(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict A.T.(the 'Tenant') The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination
date. (L2 application)
 
This application was heard in Toronto on May 31, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord’s
representative, J.S. attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 application:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from January 1, 2018
to May 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective March 1, 2018.
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $980.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by
the Landlord.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 1, 2018 to March 1, 2018.
4.     
The Tenant paid $2,000.00
after the application was filed.
5.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
L2 application:
6.     
The Tenant has persistently
paid the monthly rent late. The Landlord provided a ledger sheet at the hearing
that confirms that the Tenant has paid rent late almost every month in the past
12 months.
 
7.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
L1 application:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before June 16,
2018.
2.     
As of the date of this
order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the Landlord is
entitled to by $271.52*.
3.     
However, the Landlord is
authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the Landlord owes
the Tenant: $34.99 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
June 6, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit, and $190.00 for the
cost of filing the application.
4.     
The Landlord or the Tenant
shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
5.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 16, 2018, then starting June 17, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
6.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 17, 2018.
7.     
If, on or before June 16,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $1,752.45** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after June 17, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
L2
application
9.     
If the Tenant voids the
eviction order for non-payment of rent pursuant to paragraph 7 or 8 above then
the Tenant shall pay to the Landlord new rent on time and in full on the first
business day of the month commencing July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2019.
 
10.  
If the Tenant fails to make
any one of the payments in accordance with paragraph 9 of this order the
Landlord may, without notice to the Tenants, apply to the Board pursuant to
section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenants and requiring that the Tenants pay any new arrears, NSF fees and
related charges that became owing after June 30, 2018.
