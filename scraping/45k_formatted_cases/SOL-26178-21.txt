BASEMENT, 231 FEATHERSTONE ROAD MILTON ON L9T7C2

Landlords

Mandeep Singh Prabhsandeep Singh


Tenants



 
 
Shraddha Mittal and Gaurav
Mittal (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Mandeep Singh and Prabhsandeep Singh (the 'Tenants') because the
Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 19, 2022.
 
The Landlords and the Tenants attended
the hearing. The Tenants were represented at the
hearing by their paralegal Francisco Gomez.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlords’ L2 application is based on an N12 Notice in which the Landlord seeks to
take residential occupancy of the rental unit, with a termination date of
November 30, 2021.
 
2.    
The N12 indicates both the Landlords’ child and parent intend to move into the rental
unit and occupy it for it least one year.
 
3.      Section 72(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”)
prohibits the Board
from ordering a “personal use” eviction if the landlord has not filed a
declaration from the person who requires the unit certifying that they require
it in good faith for at least one year. Moreover, s. 55.1 requires a landlord
seeking a personal use eviction to pay one month’s compensation to the tenant
before the proposed termination date. In this case the Landlords failed to
satisfy both requirements.
 
4.    
The affidavit that accompanied the
application was sworn by the Landlords, not their parent or child. Neither
the Landlords’ parent
nor child was present to testify
about their




File Number: SOL-26178-21
 
intention to occupy the rental unit for at least one year.
Moreover, the Landlords did not provide any compensation to the
Tenants.
 
5.    
I
find that the Landlords have not satisfied
the Act’s compensation and declaration
requirements, and their application will be dismissed accordingly.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlords’ application is dismissed.
