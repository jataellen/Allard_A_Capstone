Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-96905-18










 

J.S
and #.O.L C/O J.S (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict P.J (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes. (L1 application)
 
The
Landlords also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the
Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with
the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlords or another tenant. The Landlords also claimed compensation for each
day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date. (L2
application)
 
This
combined application was heard in Toronto on August 7, 2018.
 
Only the Landlords attended the hearing.
 
I was satisfied that the Notice of Hearing was properly served on
the parties and that there is no adjournment request or any indication from the
Tenant that she would not be able to attend the hearing.
 
This matter was scheduled to be heard at 9:30 AM.  I waited until
12:05 PM and proceeded to hear this matter without the Tenant in attendance.
 
Determinations:
 
            L1 application
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from April 1, 2018 to August 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective June 15, 2018.
2.      The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
3.      The monthly rent as of the date of the hearing is $1,100.00.
4.      The
Landlords collected a rent deposit of $1,100.00 from the Tenant and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlords.
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from November 2, 2017
to June 15, 2018.
6.      The
Tenant paid $800.00 after the application was filed.
            L2
application
7.      On
March 21, 2018, the Landlord served an N5 notice of termination with a
termination date of April 16, 2018 pursuant to section 64 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act). The N5 alleges that the rental unit has three
bedrooms but the Tenant is only entitled to use one bedroom as agreed to. 
However, the Landlord has discovered that the Tenant has three other
unauthorized occupants in the rental unit using the other two bedrooms.
8.      Pursuant
to section 64(3) of the Act, the Tenant can void the N5 notice by correcting
the conduct during the seven day period following the service of the N5 notice.
In this case I find that the Tenant did not correct the conduct described in
the N5 during the voiding period because according to the Landlord’s
uncontested evidence, the behaviour continued.
9.      The
Landlord further served the Tenant a second N5 Notice on June 5, 2018, with a
termination date of June 25, 2018, alleging the same conduct by the Tenant
which has not ceased.  There is no voiding period for the second N5 Notice.
10.   The
Landlord showed the rental agreement to me although he did not bring an extra
copy to be entered as an exhibit in the file.  I am satisfied that the Tenant
acknowledged in paragraph 26 of the rental agreement that she is entitled to
the use of only one bedroom in the apartment. I therefore find that the other
two bedrooms in the apartment are not part of the rental unit.
11.   The
Landlord also testified that he had entered the rental unit on June 4, 6, 19,
29 and July 25, 2018.  He had met the other occupants, and it is his evidence
that the other occupants are using the two rooms in the apartment that are not
part of the rental unit.
12.   Based
on the uncontested evidence of the Landlord, I am persuaded that, on a balance
of probabilities, the Tenant has allowed other unauthorized occupants to use
the rental unit, and occupied the two rooms in the apartment that are not a
part of the rental unit agreed to between the parties. I am also satisfied that
this has interfered with the Landlord’s lawful rights, privileges, or
interests.
Relief
from eviction
13.    I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before September 11, 2018.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $2,914.54*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to August 31, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $36.16 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting September 1, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before
September 11, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from September 12, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before September 11, 2018, then starting
September 12, 2018, the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after September 12,
2018.
