In the matter
of:


303, 120 HOMEWOOD AVENUE TORONTO ON M4Y1J4


 




Between:


Whiterose Janitorial Services Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Gustavo Trejo Perez


Tenant



 
 
 
Whiterose Janitorial Services Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order for an order to evict Gustavo
Trejo Perez (the 'Tenant') of a superintendent’s premises, because the Tenant’s
employment as superintendent has ended. The Landlord also claimed compensation
for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on January 18, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s
Agent, Sandra Crimi, and the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Justin Anisman,
attended the hearing. As of 11:50 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord
terminated the employment of the Tenant on August 29, 2021. The Tenant has not vacated the superintendent's premises
and more than one week has passed
since their employment was terminated.
 
2.    
The Landlord is
seeking $150.00 in daily compensation for the Tenant’s use of the unit
commencing on September 13, 2021 as per the employment contract enter into and signed by both the Landlord and Tenant on
April 20, 2021.




 
3.    
Sections 93 and 94 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the ‘Act’) provide as follows:
 
93(1) If a landlord has entered into a tenancy agreement with respect to
a superintendent’s premises, unless otherwise agreed, the tenancy terminates on
the day on which the employment of the tenant is terminated.
 
(2)  A
tenant shall vacate a superintendent’s premises within one week after his or her
tenancy is terminated.
 
(3)   A landlord shall not charge a tenant
rent or compensation or receive rent or compensation from a tenant with respect
to the one-week period mentioned in subsection (2).
 
94 The landlord may apply to the Board for an order terminating the
tenancy of a tenant of superintendent’s premises and evicting the tenant if the
tenant does not vacate the rental unit within one week of the termination of
his or her employment.
 
4.    
Section 93(2) of the Act makes it clear
that superintendents must vacate the unit within
one week after employment ends. When a tenant does not vacate a
superintendent unit pursuant to the Act, a landlord is entitled to file an
application under section 94 of the Act for termination of the tenancy.
 
5.    
While section
93(3) of the Act states that the landlord cannot charge a tenant any rent for
the first seven days after the termination of their employment, there is no
mention in this section of whether the landlord is entitled to compensation
from the tenant if the tenant remains in the rental unit after the seven day
period has expired. Section 86 of the Act entitles a landlord to compensation for use and occupation of a rental
unit by a tenant after the tenancy has terminated as a
result of notice, agreement of Board order. Moreover, s. 87(3) allows a
landlord to apply to the Board for an order requiring an overholding tenant to
pay compensation.
 
6.    
In my view, it is
unlikely that the Legislature intended to confer a right to compensation upon a
landlord under s. 93 without allowing that landlord to pursue a remedy before
the Board. In my view, it is likely that a superintendent unit’s tenancy
terminates upon termination of the employment relationship. Thus, when the superintendent is given notice that their employment is
terminated, this constitutes notice that the tenancy is termination as well. Accordingly, I find I have jurisdiction to award compensation to the Landlord
for the use of the unit by
the Tenant.




 
 
 
7.    
In this case, the
Tenant’s seven day rent free period ran from August 29, 2021 to September 5,
2021. However, the Landlord’s Agent testified that the employment termination letter
provided to the Tenant indicated that the Tenant
was to move out of the rental unit on September 13, 2021,
and therefore daily compensation should commence from this date. Consequently,
the Tenant owes the Landlord daily compensation for the use of the unit from
September 13, 2021 and thereafter.
 
8.    
Regarding the
amount of compensation, the Landlord seeks $150.00 per day in accordance with
the employment agreement that the parties entered I nto. I am satisfied that
this amount reflects compensation for use and occupation of the rental unit by
the Tenant.
 
9.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenant did not attend the
hearing, and thus I did not have the
opportunity to hear any evidence or submission from them relevant to my
consideration under s. 83.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of February
13, 2022. The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before February 13, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$21,300.00, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from
September 14, 2021 to February 2, 2022.
 
3.     The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$150.00 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from February 3, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$201.00.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before February 13, 2022,
the Tenant will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from February 14, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated on or before February 13, 2022, then starting
February 14, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.




 
 
 
7.     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord on or after February 14, 2022.
 
 
February 2, 2022
Date Issued
Toronto South-RO
15 Grosvenor Street, 1st Floor
