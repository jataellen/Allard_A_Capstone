Between:


Paulette M Pantovic


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Thom Ford


Tenant



 
 
 
Paulette M Pantovic (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Thom Ford (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person the Tenant permitted in
the residential complex has substantially interfered with a reasonable
enjoyment of the residential complex or another lawful right, privilege or
interest of the Landlord or another tenant.; and because the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit, or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential
complex has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises.
 
This application was heard via video conference on January 17, 2022.
 
The Landlord, the Tenant
and the Tenant’s
Legal Representative Vincenzo
Piruzza attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The landlord served a N5 Notice to End Your Tenancy
for Interfering with Others, Damage or Overcrowding (‘N5 notice’) alleging that
the Tenant’s behaviour has substantially interfered with another tenant’s
or the Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex, and/or lawful rights, privileges or
interests.
 
2.     The N5 notice
was served June 17, 2021 by leaving
the document in the Tenant’s mailbox. I am satisfied that the N5 notice was properly served and
complied with subsection 64 of the Act.
 
3.     The N5 notice does indicate that the Tenant has an
opportunity to void the notice within
7 days by refraining from the conduct complained of in the notice. Further, it indicates that the Tenant does
not have to move out if the behaviour is corrected within 7 days after
receiving the notice. Therefore, the Tenant had from June 18 to June 24, 2021 (7 days) to void the behaviour and avoid eviction.




 
 
 
4.    
The N5 notice has only reason 1
checked off which states that “Your behavior or the behavior of someone visiting
or living with you has substantially interfered with another tenants
or my reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex, and/or lawful rights,
privileges or interests. The allegations noted in the N5 notice are:
 
•        
On June 12, 2021, the Tenant was
observed pacing in the hallway, yelling and banging on the walls.
A tenant in another unit (apartment #2) opened her door as a
result of hearing the noise, at which time the Tenant got too close to her
which frightened and alarmed the other tenant.
 
•        
On June 13, 2021,
it was observed that words
were written on another tenant’s door (apartment #2).
 
•        
Between June 13 to June 16, 2021 attempts
were made to contact the
Tenant.
 
•        
On June 17, 2021, it was observed that the Tenant was in the hallway
banging on something and that
the Tenant had contacted police stating that someone was hurting children in
the residential complex.
 
 
5.     The N5 notice
was served pursuant
to section 64 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
which states:
 
A landlord may give a tenant
notice of termination of the tenancy
if the conduct of the
tenant , another occupant of the rental unit or a person permitted in the
residential complex by the tenant is such that it substantially interferes with
the reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex for all usual purposes by
the landlord or another tenant or substantially interferes with another lawful
right , privilege or interest of the landlord or another tenant.
 
Notice
(2)  
A
notice of termination under subsection (1) shall,
 
(a)  
provide a termination date not earlier
than the 20th day after
the notice is given;
 
(b)  
set out the grounds
for termination; and
 
(c)  
require the tenant, within
seven days, to stop the conduct or activity or correct the omission set out in the
notice
 
 
Notice void if tenant
complies
 
(3)  
The notice of termination under subsection (1) is void if the tenant,
within seven days after
receiving the notice, stops the conduct for activity or corrects the omission.




 
 
 
6.    
The Landlord’s L2 application indicates that the Landlord is applying to evict the Tenant because the Landlord gave the
Tenant a N5 notice. The Landlord did
not indicate that she was applying to collect any money the Tenant may owe.
 
7.     In accordance with section 64(3) of the Act,
the N5 notice is voided if the Tenant
does not engage in any further
conduct of the type described
in the N5 notice during the seven
day period after the N5 notice was given to the Tenant. In this case, the seven
day voiding period was June 18 to June 14, 2021.
 
8.    
The landlord did not lead any evidence of further conduct as the type
described in the N5 notice during the period of June 18
to 24, 2021. In fact, the Landlord
confirmed that there were no incidences involving the
Tenant during the aforementioned period of time.
 
9.    
As such, I find the N5 notice was
voided by the Tenant and therefore the allegations noted within that notice
cannot be considered. Therefore, the Landlord’s L2 application must
be dismissed.
 
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
