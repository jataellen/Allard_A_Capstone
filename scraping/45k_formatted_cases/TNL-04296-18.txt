Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-04296-18



 


 


 



 
Numbered
Company Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict SS (the ‘Tenant’) because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes (‘L1 application’) and because the Tenant has been persistently late in
paying the Tenant’s rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date (‘L2 application’).
 
This
combined application was heard in Toronto on June 4, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord’s legal representative, DR attended the hearing.
There was no record before me of a request to adjourn and I was satisfied that
the parties had proper notice of the hearing.  After waiting more than 30
minutes, I proceeded to determine the application on the basis of the materials
before me and submissions from the Landlord. 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The
Tenant has not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from March 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective April 17, 2018.
2.     This
is a monthly tenancy, and rent is due on the first day of each month.  The
evidence before me reveals that the Tenant has not paid the full rent when due in
7 of the 8 months during the period from September, 2017 to April, 2018, both
inclusive.  I am satisfied that the Tenant has been persistently late in the
payment of rent.
3.     The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,377.06 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
4.     Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2018
to April 17, 2018.
5.     No
circumstances were disclosed to me to support relief from eviction in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, (2006)
(the ‘Act’).
It is ordered that:
 
L1 Application for Non-payment of Rent
 
1.     Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before June 16, 2018.  However, even if the Tenant voids the part of this
eviction order that relates to non-payment of rent, the tenancy will be
terminated as of June 30, 2018 for the Tenant’s persistent late payment of
rent.
2.     The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $3,092.82*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to June 5, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $46.60 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting June 6, 2018 to the date he moves out of the unit.
4.     The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.     If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June
16, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated
from June 17, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     If
the unit is not vacated on or before June 16, 2018, then starting June 17,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 17, 2018.
8.     If,
on or before June 16, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $5,843.76** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction for non-payment of
rent will be void.  This means that the tenancy would not be terminated for
non-payment of rent and the Tenant could remain in the unit until June 30,
2018.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.  However, the tenancy will still be terminated on June 30, 2018
because of the Tenant’s persistent late payment of rent.
9.     The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order for eviction for non-payment of rent if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after June 17, 2018 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make
this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord. 
However, the tenancy will still be terminated on June 30, 2018 because of
the Tenant’s persistent late payment of rent.
 
L2
Application for Persistent Late Payment of Rent
10.  Even if
the Tenant voids the part of this eviction order for non-payment of rent, the
tenancy will still be terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit
on or before June 30, 2018.
 
11.  If the
unit is not vacated on or before June 30, 2018, then starting July 1, 2018, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
12.  Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after July 1, 2018.
