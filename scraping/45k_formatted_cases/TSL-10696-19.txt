Order under Section 100
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-10696-19
 











 
 

# S I. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy of M S I (the 'Tenant'), and for compensation for the use
of the rental unit.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on January 9,
2020.
 
The Landlord and the Landlord’s
legal representative M. M and the Tenant attended the hearing. The parties
consented to this application and application TSL-10697-19 being heard together
as they relate to the same allegations of unauthorized transfer of rental
units. Separate orders will be issued for each application.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
For the reasons that follow,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated as the Tenant has
transferred the tenancy to another person without the Landlord’s consent.
Background Facts
2.     
On September 30, 2019, the Landlord filed an
application with the Board to terminate the tenancy between the Landlord and
the Tenant and to evict the unauthorized occupant(s) and to order the
unauthorized occupant(s) to pay compensation for each day they remain in the rental
unit (‘A2 application’).
3.     
The Landlord’s Building Manager L H (‘LH’)
testified that at the time the application was filed an unauthorized
occupant(s) was in possession of the unit and continued to be in possession of
the unit to the date of the hearing.
4.     
LH testified that on September 4, 2019 the
Landlord learned that the Tenant had moved out of their rental unit. LH
testified that the elevator had been booked by the Tenants for August 31, 2019 and
was used for approximately 2 hours to move their furniture out of the building
and into a large moving truck. The elevator was never booked again by the
Tenant to move furniture back into the unit. On September 4, 2019, the Landlord
attended at the unit and took photos of the unit showing an empty living room, dining
room, closets, bedrooms, bathroom and cupboards. (Exhibit 7)
5.     
LH testified that the Tenant also cancelled his
parking spot as of August 31, 2019. 
6.     
The Landlord was advised by another tenant who
resides on the 11th floor that after the Tenant’s furniture was
moved out of the rental unit, the tenants in unit 1112 moved their furniture
into the rental unit. LH testified that neither the Tenant nor unit 1112 had
permission to sublet or transfer possession of the rental unit. 
7.     
On September 23, 2019, LH performed a second
inspection of the rental unit and saw that it had been re-furnished and that
there was a picture of the tenant from unit 1112’s  wife and child on the bedroom
dresser of the rental unit. (Exhibit 9)
8.     
LH also attended at unit 1112 for an inspection of
that unit on September 23, 2019. Upon inspection the unit was found to be
almost completely empty, with only two beds in the bedroom. (Exhibit 11) There
were also other people in the unit who stated that they lived in unit 1807, and
denied living in unit 1112. The Landlord confirmed these individuals were not in
fact tenants of units 1807.
9.     
LH testified that the Tenant continues to pay
rent for the rental unit but has not been seen in the building since August
2019. The Landlord believes that the Tenant has vacated the unit and has sublet
the unit to the tenants of unit 1112 without the Landlord’s permission. LH
testified that the Landlord did not
enter into a tenancy agreement with these persons.
10.   The Tenant testified that he remains in the unit and has not sublet
the rental unit. He testified that he booked the elevator and moved his
furniture out as he sold it all and was getting new furniture. He testified
that he did not have receipts for the sale of the furniture. He further
testified that he did not book the elevator to move any new furniture in as he
brought it in piece by piece before the second unit inspection. He testified
that he had no receipts for the replacement furniture purchased. 
11.   The Tenant testified that his family has a close friendship with the
tenants in unit 1112 and that is why there is now a picture of the tenant in
unit 1112’s wife and child in his bedroom. 
Analysis
12.  
Section 100 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006, S.O. 2006, c.17 (‘Act’) speaks to the unauthorized
transfer of a tenancy and a landlord’s right to terminate the tenancy and evict
a tenant and a person to whom occupancy of the rental unit was transferred. 
13.  
Subsection 100(2) of the Act
requires a landlord to apply to the Board within sixty days of discovering an unauthorized
occupancy. I find that the Landlord applied to the Board within the sixty-day
time period.
14.  
Having considered the evidence before the Board,
I find on a balance of probabilities that the Tenant vacated the rental unit on
August 31, 2019 and thereafter transferred occupancy of the unit contrary to
the Act.
15.  
I did not find the evidence of the Tenant to be
credible or plausible. The Tenant viewed the Landlord’s photographs of the unit
taken on September 4, 2019, after the elevator booking and furniture move, and
denied that the photos showed the unit was empty, despite the fact that there
was a single small end table in the entire unit. The Tenant persisted in his
evidence that the unit was never empty but was partially furnished, showing he
did not move out. That was clearly not the case in the photos presented to him
and the Board.
16.  
I further find the Tenant’s evidence regarding
the new furniture appearing in the unit with no use of the elevator to be
unbelievable and I further find it unlikely that the Tenant would keep a photo
of another tenant’s wife and daughter on his bedroom dresser.
17.  
Overall, I did not find the evidence of the
Tenant to be credible and I preferred the evidence of LH that the unit was
empty at the first inspection on September 4th and that the Tenant
vacated the unit and transferred occupancy of the unit in a manner that was not authorized by the Act. 
18.   On the evidence before the Board, I find on a preponderance of
evidence that there was a transfer of occupancy and it was neither with the
permission or consent of the Landlord.
19.  
The Landlord is entitled to
compensation for the use and occupation of the rental unit by the Unauthorized
Occupant.
20.  
The Landlord has incurred
the cost of $190.00 for filing the application and is entitled to reimbursement
of those costs. 
21.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006, and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until January 31, 2020 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act, as there are no arrears
of rent and the rent has been fully paid to the end of the month. 
22.  
Tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant will be terminated
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The tenancy
between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated as of January 31, 2020. 
2.     
The Unauthorized Occupant shall move out of the
rental unit on or before January 31, 2020.
3.     
The Unauthorized Occupant
shall also pay to the Landlord $50.05 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from February 1, 2020 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     
The Unauthorized Occupant
shall also pay the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
The Unauthorized Occupant
shall pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before January 22, 2020.
6.     
If the Unauthorized Occupant
does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing by January 22, 2020 they will
owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from January 23, 2020 at
3.00% on the outstanding balance.
7.     
If the unit is not vacated
by January 31, 2020 then
starting February 1, 2020, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (the Sheriff), so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord after February 1, 2020.
