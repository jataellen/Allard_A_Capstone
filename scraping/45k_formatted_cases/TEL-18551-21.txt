Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-18551-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


APT. #1, 112 ELGIN STREET LINDSAY ON K9V3W7


 




Between:


William Featherstone
  Alice Featherstone


Landlords




 


and


 




 


Dakota Hof


Tenant



 
 
William Featherstone and Alice
Featherstone (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Dakota
Hof (the 'Tenant')
because the Landlord
requires possession of the
rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 9, 2021.
The Landlords and the Tenant attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.     On July 29, 2021 the Landlords served
the Tenant with an N12 notice pursuant
to section 48 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). The Termination Date in the notice is
September 30, 2021.
 
2.     Section 48.1 of the Act requires that a Landlord
compensate a Tenant an amount equal to one month’s
rent. Section 55.1 of the Act requires
that the compensation be paid by no
later than the termination date set out in the notice.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $780.00.
 
4.    
The parties agreed that the Tenant
sent 2 separate e-transfers for rent for September
2021 on September 3, 2021. The first e-transfer was for $500.00 and the second
e- transfer was for $280.00.
 
5.     The Landlords testified that they originally declined
the e-transfer for $500.00 on the same day, but then later
accepted it as the Tenant
indicated they would not be moving
out. The Landlords also accepted the e-transfer for $280.00.
 
6.     The Landlords further
testified that no further attempts
at paying compensation to the Tenant were
made after September 3, 2021.

7.    
Since the Landlords accepted the
full rent for September 2021 and have not compensated the Tenant an amount equal
to one month’s rent by the termination date in the notice,
I find that the Landlords have not paid the required
compensation pursuant to section 55.1 of the Act.
 
8.    
For this reason, I must dismiss
the Landlords’ application.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlords’ application is dismissed.
