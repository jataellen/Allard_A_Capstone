Manitoulin-Sudbury DSB (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Faith Jolivet (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 3, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Kristian Thorne, attended the hearing. As of 2:47 p.m.,
the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although properly
served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from May 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021.
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective November 2, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on December
7, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $884.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of December 7, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$6,121.10*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to December 7, 2021.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.




File Number: NOL-44373-21
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 22, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 23, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
