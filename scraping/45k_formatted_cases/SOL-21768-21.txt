Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-21768-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


15
  VANJO DRIVE WELLAND ON L3C7B6


 




Between:


Kathy Allan-Fleet
  Michael Fleet


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Daniel Adam


Tenant



 
 
 
Kathy Allan-Fleet and Michael Fleet (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Daniel
Adam (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 3, 2022.
 
The Landlord, Kathy Allan-Fleet, and the Landlords’ Legal Representative,
Peter Giblett, attended the hearing. As
of 9:34 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period from April 1,
2021 to October 31, 2021. Because of the arrears,
the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective May 8,
2021.
 
2.    
The lawful monthly rent is $2,200.00.
 
3.     The Landlords collected
a rent deposit of $2,200.00
from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlords.
 
4.    
The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before February 26, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $19,948.02*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February 15,
2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $72.33
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 16, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before February
26, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 27, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit
is not vacated on or before February 26, 2022, then starting February 27, 2022, the Landlords may file this
order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after
February 27, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 26, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $23,286.00** to the Landlords or to the Board in trust, this
order for eviction will be void. This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after
February 27, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlords. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlords.
