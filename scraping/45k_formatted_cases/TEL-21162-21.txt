Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-21162-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


55 BETTINA PLACE WHITBY ON L1R0E9


 




Between:


Shuai Wang


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Danielle
Keeping Michael Bowen


Tenants



 
 
 
Shuai Wang (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Danielle
Keeping and Michael Bowen (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on November 8,
2021 with respect to application TEL-18252-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the
Tenants did not meet certain
condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenants
have not met the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $3000.00 arrears
on or before October 30, 2021. The Tenant did not pay $2070.00 rent on or before
November 1, 2021.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order
required the Tenants
to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenants
were ordered to pay $5,201.00 for rent arrears
in Order TEL-18252-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $5,201.00 and
that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order
TEL-18252-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenants
have failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from November 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $2,000.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from August
1, 2017 to January 12, 2022.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TEL-18252-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 23, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$8,039.57*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to January 12, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $68.05
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 13, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
23, 2022, the Tenants will start
to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from
January 24, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 23, 2022, then starting January
24, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 24, 2022.

The tenant has until January 22, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 22, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on July 24, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction
where the rental unit is located.
