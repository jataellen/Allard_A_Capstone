Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number: EAL-98264-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
1, 269 STE. ANNE AVENUE VANIER ON K1L7C3


 




Between:


Dreammind Properties


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Danny Ethier


Tenant



 
 
 
Dreammind Properties (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Danny Ethier (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 1, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Beth Hernen,
attended the hearing.
As of 10:58 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
July 1, 2019 to February
28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective October 2,
2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $875.68
as of January 1, 2022.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $850.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from March 1, 2013 to December 31, 2020.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $3,400.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 22, 2022.
 
2.    
As of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the Landlord is entitled to by $163.83*.
 
3.     However, the Landlord
is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenant: $28.79
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February
12, 2022 to the
date the Tenant
moves out of the unit,
and $186.00 for the cost of
filing the application.
 
4.    
The Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a
result of this order.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 22, 2022, then starting
February 23, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 23, 2022.
 
7.     If, on or before February 22, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $1,546.36** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 23, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period
of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
