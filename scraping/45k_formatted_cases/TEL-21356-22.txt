Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-21356-22
 



In the matter
of:


BASEMENT, 30 FLINTWICK DRIVE TORONTO ON M1P4G9


 




Between:


Mariakatrina Sumadchat Griffiths Lee Griffiths


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Christopher Seti


Tenant



 
 
Mariakatrina Sumadchat Griffiths and Lee Griffiths (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Christopher Seti (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant
gave a notice to terminate the tenancy.
 
This
application was heard by video conference on February 16, 2022. Only the
Landlord, Lee Griffiths attended the hearing. As of 1:40 p.m., the Tenant was
not present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice
of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     On November 5, 2021, the Landlords and the Tenant
signed an Agreement to End the Tenancy (N11) with a termination date of
December 31, 2021. The Tenant did not vacate the rental unit on the termination
date.
 
2.     The Landlord testified
at the hearing that the Tenant occupies
a unit in the basement
of the residential complex. Section
43 (1) (a) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 states that where this Act permits a landlord or tenant to give a notice
of termination, the notice shall, amongst other things,
identify the rental unit for which the notice is given.
 
3.     In this case, the notice of termination does not
identify the rental unit as a basement unit. Therefore, I find that the parties
failed to comply
with the mandatory requirement to identify the specific unit rented
by the Tenant. The notice is
defective, and the Board will not issue an order terminating the tenancy
without a valid notice of termination.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlords' application is dismissed.
