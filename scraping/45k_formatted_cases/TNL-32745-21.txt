Act, 2006

In the
  matter of:


30 VIEW NORTH COURT WOODBRIDGE ON L4L8S4


 




Between:


Weiting Bollu


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


John Spezzano Lucia
Spezzano


Tenants



 
 
 
Weiting Bollu (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict John Spezzano and Lucia
Spezzano (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on February
17, 2022. The Landlord,
represented by Jordan Nieuwhof, attended the hearing.
 
The Tenant Lucis Spezzano, called into the hearing at 11:15am after the hearing
concluded. Ms. Spezzano came
to the hearing room and testified she called in when she woke up. There no explanation or reason provided as
to why John Spezzano did not attend.
 
The Landlord’s representative submits
he sent an email and tried to call the Tenants from the
hearing because they were not in attendance.
 
It is also worth noting that the Landlord’s evidence shows the Tenants are $26,702.00 in arrears
or rent. This includes a credit the
Landlord’s representative confirmed in writing to the Tenants for the one-month
compensation for the N12 notice before the termination date on the notice.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord swore an affidavit
and testified at the hearing
that he in good faith requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
2.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $3,000.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
3.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from June 8, 2017 to
June 30, 2021




 
 
 
4.     The Landlord paid the Tenant compensation equal
to one month's rent.
 
5.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated, as of March 5, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the
rental unit on or before March 5, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$20,619.86, which represents compensation for the
use of the unit from July 1, 2021 to February 22, 2022, less the rent deposit
and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $100.41
per day for compensation for the use of the unit from February 23, 2022 to
the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before March 5, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated
from March 6, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 5, 2022, then starting
March 6, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 6, 2022.

81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
