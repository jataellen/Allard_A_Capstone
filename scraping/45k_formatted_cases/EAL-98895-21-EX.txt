In the matter
of:


902, 2020 JASMINE CRESCENT GLOUCESTER ON K1J8K5


 




Between:


Michael Mcgee


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Cristina
Dufaure


Tenant



 
 
 
Michael Mcgee (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Cristina Dufaure (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified in the mediated settlement issued by the Board
on July 8, 2021 with respect to application EAL-92851-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The mediated settlement
provided that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the
Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the settlement.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant has not met the following conditions specified in the settlement: On October 17, 2021 and
October 29, 2021 the Tenant interfered with the Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment
of the property by causing a disturbance by banging on the neighbours’ doors,
yelling and slamming doors.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 16, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated on or before January
16, 2022, then starting January
17, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
 
3.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 17, 2022.
