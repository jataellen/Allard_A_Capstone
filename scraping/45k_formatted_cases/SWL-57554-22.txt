In the matter
of:


 
313, 621 KIPPS
LANE LONDON ON N5Y0B1


 




Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Adeola Idowu


Tenant



 
 
 
On June 25, 2021, Medallion
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied in this L4 application for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Adeola
Idowu (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes
because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the review order
issued by the Board on April 29, 2021 with respect to application HOL-07521- 20_RV.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The previous review order provided
that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the
Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I find that the Tenant has not met
the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $784.23 arrears
on or before June 20, 2021.The Tenant
did not pay $ 899.94 rent on
or before June 1, 2021. These were breaches of paragraphs 3(a) and 2 of the
review order. This application was filed within 30 days of the breaches.
 
3.       
The previous L1 application included a request
for an order for the payment
of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the
Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in
addition to eviction, in this L4 application the Landlord is entitled to
request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$9,410.80 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in review order HOL-07521-20_RV. The Tenant failed
to make any payments
towards the amount
ordered in the review order, so there
is still $9,410.80 owing from the previous order,
which is included in this order. As a result, the previous review order
HOL-07521-20_RV is cancelled.




 
5.       
Since the date of the review
order, the Tenant has failed
to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from May 1,
2021 to January 31, 2022.
 
6.       
On October 9, 2018 the Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $899.94 from the Tenant and
this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.       
Interest was last paid out to the
Tenant on December 31, 2020. Interest is owing for the period from January 1,
2021 to the date of this order,
January 25, 2022 (note: there was no guideline rent increase allowed,
and consequently 0% interest on rent deposit,
for the year 2021 due to
COVID19).
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The previous review order HOL-07521-20_RV is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 5, 2022 (standard 11 days from the
issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
If the Tenant made any payments
to the Landlord after this L4 application was filed on June 25, 2021, those amounts shall be
deducted from the calculations below.
 
Refer to the Summary
of Calculations
 
4.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $10,310.00*. This amount represents the rent owing up to June 30, 2021 and the costs
related to the application fee for the previous L1 application, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
5.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$29.59 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting July 1, 2021 to the
date the Tenant actually moves out of the rental unit or gets evicted.
 
6.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
5, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 6, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 5, 2022, then starting February
6, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 6, 2022.
