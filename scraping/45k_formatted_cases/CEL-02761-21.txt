In the matter
of:


308, 7 ELIZABETH STREET N MISSISSAUGA
  ON L5G2Y8


 




Between:


IMH Pool VI-A
LP


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Tamsin
Brown


Tenant



 
 
 
IMH Pool VI-A LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tamsin Brown (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021. The Landlord’s Legal Representative, Sean Beard and the Tenant attended the
hearing. The Tenant declined the opportunity to speak with Duty Counsel prior
to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to December 31,
2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 28, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $2,284.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant
has made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $2,284.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 15, 2021 to August 28, 2021.
 
7.    
It was uncontested the total rent arrears owing to the Landlord by the
Tenant up to December 31, 2021 is $11,420.00.
 
8.    
The Tenant stated they
lost their job shortly after moving into the rental unit which has caused their inability to pay the monthly rent;
they were self employed so not eligible
for




 
E.I. or other
assistance. They start a new job on January 10, 2022 and their first pay will
not be until January 31, 2022. As they will be earning
approximately $5,800.00 per month
they will be in a position to pay the full rent as it comes due as well as an
additional
$1,142.00 per
month towards rent arrears. The Tenant requested the Board grant relief and impose their repayment
plan which will preserve the tenancy while making monthly
to the Landlord to pay the rent owed. The Tenant resides in the unit
with their 23 year old disabled daughter.
 
9.    
The Landlord opposed
the Tenant’s proposed repayment plan as the arrears are significant and without payment
for January’s rent will increase. The tenancy only started
in mid May 2021 and the Tenant has made no payments to the Landlord for 5
months.
 
10.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including the Tenant’s personal and financial
circumstances and weighed this against any potential prejudice to the Landlord
and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $13,890.00, which represents the arrears of rent
($11,420.00 to December 31, 2021 + January 2022 rent), and costs ($186.00).
 
2.    
The Landlord’s application for eviction
of the Tenant is denied
on the condition that:
 
•        
The Tenant shall pay
$1,142.00 to the Landlord on or before the 1st of each month commencing on February 1, 2022,
up to and including January
1, 2023.
 
•        
The Tenant
shall pay $186.00
to the Landlord on or before February
1, 2023.
 
•        
The Tenant shall also
pay the Landlord the rent for the months of February 2022 up to and including
February 2023 in full, on or before
the first day of each corresponding month.
 
3.    
If the Tenant fails
to make any of the payments in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates required, then:
 
(a)  
The Landlord may apply
under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for
an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, and for the payment
of any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not already ordered under paragraph
1 of this order. The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a
breach of a condition set out in paragraph 2 of this order.
 
(b)  
The balance owing under
paragraph 1 of this order shall become payable on the day following the date of default.
The monies owing shall bear interest
at the post-judgment interest
rate determined under subsection 207(7) of the Act.
