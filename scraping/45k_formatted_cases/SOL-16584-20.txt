Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-16584-20
 
 



In the
  matter of:


BASEMENT UNIT, 37 DREW STREET GUELPH ON N1H1Z8


 




Between:


Krzysztof Ciesek
  Patrycja Tajner


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Curstin Marianne Schaefer William Jordan Sillers


Tenants



 
 
Krzysztof Ciesek and Patrycja
Tajner (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Curstin
Marianne Schaefer and William Jordan
Sillers (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 1, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative,
Peter Balatidis, attended the hearing. As of 10:26 a.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the
total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2020 to September
30, 2020. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords
served a Notice of Termination effective September 8, 2020.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on April 19, 2021. The Tenants
were in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.    
The monthly rent is $1,300.00.
 
4.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,300.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from May 1, 2020 to
September 8, 2020.
 
6.     The Tenants paid $250.00 after the application was filed.




File Number: SOL-16584-20
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of April
19, 2021, the date the Tenants gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlords.
 
2.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlords $10,912.67*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to April 19, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before
February 18, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
