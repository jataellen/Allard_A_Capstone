Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-24284-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


503, 150 DOWLING AVENUE TORONTO ON M6K3A8


 




Between:


IMH Pool
VI-a LP


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Aarik Wells Ryan Messenger


Tenants



 
 
IMH Pool VI-a LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ryan Messenger and Aarik Wells (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
12, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Tricia Radam attended the hearing. As of 10:07 a.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the
period from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective August 29, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,274.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made
no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,274.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from April
12, 2021 to August 29, 2021.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact
of COVID-19 on the parties
and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment




 
agreement with the Tenant and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenants void the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 30, 2022.
 
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $5,909.01*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 19, 2022, less
the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$41.88 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 20, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
30, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 31,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 30, 2022, then starting January
31, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 31, 2022.
 
8.     
If, on or before January 30, 2022,
the Tenants pay the amount of $7,810.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction
will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     
The Tenants may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after January
31, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
