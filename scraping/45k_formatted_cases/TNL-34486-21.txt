Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-34486-21
 



In the matter
of:


25, 79 CLEARVIEW HEIGHTS TORONTO ON M6M2A4


 




Between:


Rossvan Apartments


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Nehemiah
Drummond


Tenant



 
 
 
Rossvan
Apartments (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Nehemiah Drummond (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on December
13, 2021. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Jason
Paine, attended the hearing. As of 10:09 a.m.,
the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period
from October 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective March 14, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $799.90.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $799.90 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 1, 2021 to March 14, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $7,650.00 after
the application was filed.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the parties and whether
the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 16, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$2,275.81*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January
5, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $26.30
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 6, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
16, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January
17, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 17, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 16, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $3,896.30** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain
in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January 17, 2022 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to
make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
