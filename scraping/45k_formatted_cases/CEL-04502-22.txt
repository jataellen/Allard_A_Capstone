Order under
Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number:
CEL-04502-22




In the
matter of:


106, 450 28TH STREET W OWEN SOUND ON N4K6B4


 




Between:


Skyline Living


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Scott Turner


Tenant



 
 
On January 20, 2022, Skyline Living (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Scott Turner (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay
the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on January 4, 2022 with respect to
application CEL-02475-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition(s) specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed
to pay to the Landlord
$500.00 on or before January
15, 2022 towards arrears
of rent. Tenant
has also failed
to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from January
1, 2022 to January 31, 2022
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $5,030.40 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
CEL-02475-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $5,030.40
and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous
order CEL-02475-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has also
failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.
 
6.     Since the date of the order, the Landlord incurred
$20.00 for administration charges related to a cheque tendered
by or on behalf of the Tenant,
which were returned
NSF.




 
7.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,193.88 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
8.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from November 1, 2021
to February 4, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order CEL-02475-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 15, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,050.40*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 31, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the
Landlord $39.25 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
15, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 15, 2022, then starting February
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 16, 2022.
