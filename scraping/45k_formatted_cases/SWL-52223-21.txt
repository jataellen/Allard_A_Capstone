  matter of:


1002D, 75 ANN
STREET LONDON ON N6A1R1


 




Between:


Centurion Property Associates Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Nathen
  Katigbak


Tenant



 
 
Centurion
Property Associates Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Nathen Katigbak (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 6, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s Legal Representative, Robert
Rose, and the Tenant attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant
has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from March 1, 2021 to May 31, 2021.
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
May 1, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant
was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.    
The Landlord’s Legal Representative submitted
that the Tenant vacated the rental unit on
July 31, 2021.
 
4.    
The lawful
monthly rent was
$719.00.
 
5.    
The Landlord
incurred costs of $201.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $719.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from April 1, 2020 to May 1, 2021.




File Number: SWL-52223-21
 
8.    
The amount
outstanding to July 31, 2021, inclusive of rent arrears,
and costs, is
$3,117.00.
 
9.    
At the hearing, the
Tenant presented a copy of a text that he had sent to the Landlord stating that he was to be leaving the rental unit at the end of April 2021 and that he did not
owe anything to the Landlord as a result. The Tenant added that he had sublet
the rental unit to another student but unfortunately that student had left as
well.
 
10.  The Landlord’s Legal Representative then submitted a copy of the signed lease between the Landlord and the Tenant which
stated that the Tenant was responsible for the first year of the three year rental agreement which allowed the Tenant to leave at the earliest on August 31,
2021. The Landlord’s Legal Representative added that the Tenant was responsible
for the rental unit whether his sublet tenant remained or not.
 
11.  The Landlord’s Legal Representative stated that allowing
the Tenant to leave officially at the end of July 2021 was actually one month less than the
Tenant was actually responsible for.
 
12.  Therefore,
I find that given the circumstances of this matter,
the vacate date of July 31,
2021 is a fair outcome for both parties.
 
13.  This order contains
all of the reasons in this matter
and no further reasons will be issued.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of July
31, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,214.09*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to July 31, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
January 27, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
January 28, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
