Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-20537-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


94 HILLHEAD RD REABORO ON K0L2X0


 




Between:


Zubeda Nanji
Richard (Rick) Gosling


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Amber Rhodes Drew Weatherall


Tenants



 
 
 
Zubeda Nanji and
Richard (Rick) Gosling (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Amber Rhodes and Drew Weatherall (the 'Tenants') because the
Landlords require possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlords also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 21, 2021.
 
The Landlord, Richard Gosling (RG),
the Landlords’ Legal Representative, Waylon
Skinner, and the Tenants
attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
On September 10, 2021,
the Landlords served the Tenants with an N12 Notice of Termination (N12) with a
termination date of November 30, 2021. The N12 seeks termination of the tenancy
on the ground that the Landlords require
the rental unit for
residential occupation.
 
2.    
The Landlords
paid the Tenant
compensation equal to one month's
rent on September
9, 2021.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is
$1,635.00.
 
4.    
The Landlords
collected a rent deposit of $1,635.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from July 1, 2019 to
November 30, 2021.




 
 
 
Good Faith
 
6.    
The N12 was served
pursuant to section
48 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act). Section 48(1) requires that, in
order to be successful in this application, the Landlords must establish that
at the time of the service of the N12 they required, in good faith, the unit
for residential use.
 
7.    
In Feeney v. Noble,
1994 CanLII 10538 (ON SC), the Court held that the test of good faith is
genuine intention to occupy the premises and not the reasonableness of the
Landlord’s proposal. This principle was upheld in Salter v. Beljinac 2001
CanLII 40231 (ON SCDC), where the Court held that the “good faith” requirement
simply means that the Landlord sincerely intends to occupy the rental unit. The
Landlord may also have additional motives for selecting a particular rental
unit, but this does not affect the good
faith of the Landlord’s notice.
 
8.    
In the more recent case
of Fava v. Harrison, [2014] O.J No. 2678 ONSC 3352 (Ont.Div.Ct.) the
Court determined that while the
motives of the Landlord are, per
Salter, “largely irrelevant”, the Board can consider the conduct and motives of
the Landlord to draw inferences as to whether
the Landlord desires,
in good faith to occupy
the property.
 
9.    
In this matter, the Landlords’ N12 was served
to the Tenants as the Landlords both intend
to occupy the rental unit for at least one year. The Landlords submitted their
Affidavits stating their intent to move in with their application to the Board.
 
10.  At the hearing,
the Tenants attempted to portray the Landlords as acting in bad faith by
submitting that the Landlords had promised the rental unit to another party at
a higher rental rate. However, there was insufficient evidence presented to
substantiate their claim.
 
11.  The Tenants then requested that extra time was necessary due to schooling
dates and job requirements.
The Landlord (RG) was sympathetic and agreed to the Tenants’ request.
 
12.  Therefore, I am satisfied, based on the
Landlords’ evidence in this matter, that they genuinely intend to live in the rental unit for at least one year. I find that the Landlords in good faith require possession of the rental unit
for the purpose of residential occupation
for themselves for a period of at least one year.
 
Relief From Eviction
 
13.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until April 30, 2022 pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. This date was agreed to by both parties at the hearing as it
would allow the Tenants the time to find another place to live.
 
14.  This order contains
all of the reasons in this matter
and no further reasons will be
issued.




 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlords
and the Tenants is terminated, as of April
30, 2022. The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before April 30, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlords
$261.62, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from December 1, 2021
to January 5, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the
rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlords $53.75
per day for compensation for the use of the unit from January 6, 2022 to
the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full amount owing on or before
April 30, 2022, they will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest calculated from May 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
5.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before April 30, 2022, then starting May 1, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after May 1, 2022.
