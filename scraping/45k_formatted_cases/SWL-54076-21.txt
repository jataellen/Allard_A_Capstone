In the matter
of:


 
07, 94 KING
EDWARD AVENUE LONDON ON
  N5Z3S8


 




Between:


King Edward Apartments


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Cassandra Cooper


Tenant



 
 
 
King Edward
Apartments (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Cassandra Cooper (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of
the rental unit or someone the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex
has wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord
for the damage. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on December 6, 2021.
 
Only the
Landlord’s Agents, Manny Bedi and Suki Bedi, attended the hearing. As of 12:50 p.m.,
the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
On June 14, 2021, the
Tenant left bags of garbage in the hallway of the residential complex contrary
to the lease agreement. The Landlord submitted the lease agreement and pictures
of the garbage bags left by the Tenant. As a result,
the Tenant was given a first N5 notice to terminate the
tenancy. Based on the uncontested evidence, I am satisfied that the Landlord
has proven the allegations on the first N5 notice.
 
2.    
On August 11, 2021, the
Landlord received complaints from resident living below the Tenant’s unit
regarding water leaking into her unit. Upon inspection, the Landlord discovered that the Tenant
was using an air conditioner unit that was leaking water into a bucket.
The bucket overflowed and the excess
liquid caused damage
to the ceiling of the unit below. The Landlord submitted
pictures of the leaking air conditioner unit along with pictures of the damage
to the unit below. As a result of this incident, the Landlord gave the Tenant a
second N5 notice.




 
3.    
Based on the
uncontested evidence, I am satisfied that the Tenant wilfully or negligently
caused undue damage to the residential complex. I say this because despite
receiving the second N5 notice, the Tenant continued to use the air conditioner
leading to additional complaints from the resident
of the unit below regarding water leaking from the
Tenant’s unit.
 
4.    
The Landlord
incurred costs of $650.00 to repair the damage. Although
the Landlord did not submit an invoice to substantiate this amount, I find this cost to be
reasonable given the pictures of the
damage, similar cases and my experience with the Board.
 
5.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
the Act. The Tenant was not present at the hearing
to request relief and the Landlord is not aware of any reason to grant relief.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
January 24, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 24, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$650.00, which represents the reasonable costs
of repairing the damage.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$30.92 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from January 14, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before January
24, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 25, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 24, 2022, then starting January
25, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 25, 2022.
