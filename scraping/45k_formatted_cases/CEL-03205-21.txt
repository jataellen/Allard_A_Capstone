Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number: CEL-03205-21




In the
matter of:


031, 1455 BRISTOL
ROAD W MISSISSAUGA ON L5V1W5


 




Between:


Bristol Road Non-profit Homes
Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Dinella McDonald


Tenant



 
 
 
Bristol Road Non-profit Homes
Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dinella McDonald
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 24, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Kenia
Afolabi, attended the hearing. As of 2:40 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
September 1, 2020 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October
3, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent for the unit increased
to $1,437.00.
 
4.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $92.66 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 1, 2021 to October 3, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $7,950.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.

It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 11, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$77.96*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January 31, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord
owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$46.68 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
11, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 12, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 11, 2022, then starting February 12, 2022, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 12, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$312.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022,
or
ii)             
$1,749.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 11, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 12, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this
motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
