Brett Ruttle Carolyn Ruttle


 
Tenants



 
 
 
Carolyn Ruttle
and Brett Ruttle (the 'Tenants') filed a motion to set aside order SWL-48816-21
because, before the eviction order was enforced, the Tenants paid the amount
required under subsection 74(11) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') to void the order.
 
This motion
was heard by video conference on January 12, 2022. The Landlord’s Agent, L.
Todd and the Tenant, Brett Ruttle
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not previously made a motion under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside an eviction order during the period of the tenancy with the Landlord.
 
2.    
The parties agree that for the
period from July 8, 2021 to November 3, 2021, the Tenants paid $9,530.00 to the
Landlord. This amount is more than the amount required under subsection 74(11)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 to void the eviction order, and to pay the Landlord’s non-refundable fee
of $335.00 under the Administration of Justice Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Order SWL-48816-21 is void and cannot be enforced by the Landlord.
