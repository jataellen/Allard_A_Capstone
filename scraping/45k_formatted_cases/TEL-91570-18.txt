W.J.W. Canada Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict T.S. and T.H. (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Whitby on June 18, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenants
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent they were required to pay for the period from March 1, 2018 to
June 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective May 24, 2018.
2.    
The Tenants argued that they
do not owe the amount the Landlord claims because the second-named Tenant was
doing work for the Landlord and due to the Landlord not having particular items
done the Tenant could not continue with the work.
3.    
Based on the Tenant’s
testimony the relationship between the parties regarding the work is that the
Landlord contracted the Tenant to do work on a separate house.  It is clear the
Tenants were using the money made from the contract job towards their rent; however,
the Tenants led no evidence to support the position that there was any other
connection between their rent and the work on contract.
4.    
The second-named Tenant did
work for the Landlord and paid the rent to the end of February 2018.  As of
March 2018 the Tenants have paid no rent.
5.    
The Landlord submitted text
messages between the parties which indicate that the Tenants still owed rent
and that it would have to be paid.   
6.    
On April 6, 2018 the
Landlord sent the Tenants a text message which said, “Trevor we need to settle
the month of March and we are already April 6th we can’t leave rent
accumulating and pending.”
7.    
The problem with the Tenants
argument that the Landlord did not have the necessary steps done in order for
the second-named Tenant to continue work at a separate property is completely
separate from the Tenants’ responsibility to pay the rent.  If the second-named
Tenant had a contract job with someone other than the Landlord it would be
viewed in the same way.
8.    
That being said, the Tenants
led insufficient evidence to support their claim that the arrears the Landlord
is claiming is incorrect.  They even testified that there is no completed work
that the Landlord has not paid the Tenant for completing.   
9.    
I find the amount declared
by the Landlord to be correct.
10.  The Landlord collected a rent deposit of
$1,500.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlord.
11.  Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenants for the period from June 1, 2017 to May 24, 2018.
12.  The Tenants mentioned that they are not sure
they even wish to continue living in the rental unit.  They also said that if
given the time they could leave in August 2018.  With these statements in
tandem with the fact that there is no income coming into the household, an
order with standard terms shall issue.
13.  I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
14.  This order contains all of the reasons for the
decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before August
10, 2018.
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $5,961.51*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to July 30, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $49.32 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting July 31, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before August 10, 2018, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
August 11, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before August 10, 2018, then starting August 11, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after August 11, 2018.
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void
this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust:
i)       $7,675.00 if the payment is made on or before July 31, 2018, or
ii)      $9,175.00 if the payment is made on or before August 10, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.    
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after August 11,
2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
