Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12421-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


102, 68 LINDSAY STREET
N LINDSAY ON K9V0N7


 




Between:


Klh Housing
Corp.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Michaela Davey


Tenant



 
 
 
Klh Housing Corp. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Michaela
Davey (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or
someone they permitted in the residential complex have substantially interfered
with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord
or another tenant.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in
Passcode: 956 0593 7653# on February 1, 2022.
The Landlord’s representatives Shelly Smith
and Krista Bull attended the hearing. Ms. Bull testified that she has reminded the Tenant about the hearing
and that the Tenant was well aware of the proceedings. The Tenant did not
attend the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
On April 9, 2021 the Tenant
caused smoke in his unit and the hallway because
to plastic on the stovetop. As a result,
the fire department was required to attend. August 4, 2021 the Tenant caused a fire in his
rental unit that filled the floor with smoke.
The fire department attended and remediated the situation.
 
2.     The residential complex
provides housing for individuals with a substance
abuse history. The residential
complex has a no smoking policy in the common areas so that residents are not
exposed to smoke. The Tenant has been
asked to stop this activity but ignores the requests and continues to smoke in
the common areas.
 
3.     The Tenant repeatedly permits people who have been trespassed by the Landlord
into the residential complex.
 
4.     The Tenant also continues to put garbage
in the hallway after being asked to stop this activity.

5.    
The Landlord has made ongoing
attempts to work with the Tenant to remedy these issues but the Tenant refused
to cooperate. I find that based on
the uncontested testimony and evidence
submitted by the Landlord, that the Tenant
will continue these activities while residing in the
residential complex.
 
6.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of February
15, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 15, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$364.64, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from November 11,
2021 to February 4, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$4.24 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from February 5, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
February 15, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 15, 2022, then starting February
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 16, 2022.
