Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-02022-21
 



In the matter
of:


UPPER LEVEL, 5 ROSEVILLE UPPER LEVEL DRIVE
BAMPTON ON L6Y2G8


 




Between:


Joaquim Alexandre


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Marva D Jones


Tenant



 
 
Joaquim Alexandre (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Marva D
Jones (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay rent. Pursuant to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
the Tenant raised issues with respect to, among other things, the Landlord’s maintenance
of the rental unit and requested a rent abatement.
 
This application was heard by a video conference on December 20, 2021. The application first came before me for hearing on November 8, 2021. The hearing on 8 November 2021 was
adjourned and it was ultimately rescheduled for January 17, 2022.
 
The Landlord
and the Tenant attended the hearing
on January 17, 2022. The Landlord was represented at the hearing by his
daughter, Elizabeth Dias. Ms Dias and
the Tenant both provided evidence.
 
Ms Dias has very little personal
knowledge with respect to the matters raised by the Tenant and the
Landlord did not personally attend the hearing or provide evidence. Ms Dias indicated that her father did not
attend because his first language is not English. That is not, in my view, a reasonable justification for the Landlord
to not provide evidence. There are
means by which any
language barrier could have been addressed.
 
For ease of reference, the relevant statutory provisions are attached
as Schedule 2 to this order.
 
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has
not paid the total rent that she was required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. The Landlord served an N4 notice with a termination date of August 5, 2021 and
filed this application on August 10, 2021.




 
I.   
L1 Application
 
2.     The rental unit is the upper unit in the residential complex.
The monthly rent is
$1,600.00.
 
3.    
There is no dispute
that the Tenant has not paid rent to the Landlord since June of 2021
and currently owes rent for seven months or $11,200.00.
 
4.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,550.00
from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord. Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from December 1, 2017
through to August 5, 2021.
 
5.     The Tenant asserted
that she did not pay rent because
she believed that she was entitled
to a monthly abatement of 100%+ based on the
breach by the Landlord of his obligations under the Act. As discussed further below, the Tenant is entitled
to a rent abatement, but the Tenant is not entitled to a 100%
rent abatement.
 
6.    
The rent abatement to which
the Tenant is entitled will reduce the rent owing to
the Landlord.
 
 
II.   Tenant’s Rights Under Section
82 Section 82
7.    
The Landlord’s
application is being heard pursuant to section 69 of the Act based on a notice given pursuant to section 59. This means that section
82 of the Act is
applicable.
 
8.    
The Divisional
Court has found that section 82 provides a tenant with the right to raise
issues on an L1 without
bringing an application pursuant to subsection 29(1) [See Ansari
v.
JIHC Crescent Village, 2012 ONSC 1953 (CanLII)] Under section 82, the
tenant’s claim is dealt
with as part of the landlord’s application and there is no ‘application’ that is filed by the
tenant pursuant to section 29(1). [See
SWT-84446-16 (Re), 2016 CanLII 44317 (ON LTB), para 4]
 
9.     Rules 19.4 and 19.5 of the Board’s Rules of Procedure provide for how a tenant is to assert his or her right under
section 82. The Tenant complied with
Rule 19.04. The Landlord was aware of the assertions being made by the Tenant
and filed evidence
in response to the Tenant’s allegations.
 
10. 
The Tenant’s
primary concern relates
to what are landlord maintenance issues. Subsection 20(1) of the Act provides
 
20 (1) A landlord
is responsible for providing and maintaining a residential complex, including the rental units in
it, in a good state of repair and fit for habitation and for complying with
health, safety, housing and maintenance standards




 
11.  The Tenant has also asserted that the Landlord
illegally entered the rental unit—which can be a violation of section 25 of the
Act or constitute substantial interference in contravention of section 22 of the Act—and effectively withheld heat and air conditioning by locking
the thermostat in the rental
unit—which may be a
violation of section 21 of the
Act or constitute substantial interference in contravention of section 22.
 
12. 
Section 29 of the Act provides
a tenant with the right
to apply to the Board
seeking various orders.
 
13.  The remedies available to a tenant
on an application made pursuant
to section 29 are set out in subsections 30(1) and 31(1),
which provide, in part:
 
14. 
Tenants often raise
issues under section 82 only
in response to L1 applications. That is, in my view,
the right provided to tenants by section 82 of the Act.
 
Determining
Amount of Abatement
 
15.  As noted by the Vice Chair in TST-56138-14 (Re) [2015
CanLII 3162 (ON LTB)], ‘[a]batement of rent
is a contractual remedy based on the principle that if you are paying 100% of the rent then you
should be getting 100% of what you are paying for and if you are not getting that,
then a tenant should be entitled to abatement equal to
the difference in value.’
 
16. 
In Biltmore Terrace Apartments v. Nazareth
[[1997] O.J. No 1881 (Gen Div)], a decision
rendered under the Landlord and Tenant Act, the Court remarked:
 
It is always difficult
to arrive at a proper
amount or percentage by way of
abatement. There is no magic formula.
What is appropriate in each case will depend
on the circumstances, including the amount of rent, the age and general
condition of the premises, the nature and degree of the non repair, and its
duration, the efforts of the Landlord to inspect, the co-operation or otherwise
of the Tenant in that regard, and the efforts made by the Landlord to rectify
the defect.
 
17.  Similarly, in Offredi v. 751768 Ontario Ltd. [1994 CanLII 11006 (ON SCDC), 116
DLR (4th) 757 (Gen Div)], the Court considered complaints made by a group of tenants concerning a lengthy power outage,
lack of parking due to garage repairs,
poor maintenance of common arrears
and lack of adequate security, which extended over
a two-year period. The Court found:
 
It is well recognized in the
authorities that there is no neat formula for determining an appropriate amount
by way of abatement. In other words
slide rule precision is not possible. …The ultimate
objective is to set an amount that is fair in all the circumstances.
 
18. 
The decision
in Offredi was appealed and the Divisional Court upheld the trial judge and found:
 
As to the amount of the reduction,
the learned judge recognized that there was no mathematical way in which an
appropriate amount could be determined. He obviously wrestled with the problem
and arrived at the conclusion that 20% was a fair figure in this




 
case
to compensate the tenants for the deplorable conditions to which they have been
subjected. We can see no justification for our changing
that decision, made by the judge
who heard the evidence as to those conditions. [1994 CanLII 11006 (ON SCDC)]
 
19.  In determining what abatement to grant, the Board will assess, among
other factors:
 
(a)   The
length of time the problem
existed and the severity of the
issue(s) in terms of its
effect on the tenant;
 
(b)   Whether the landlord has already rectified the issue(s), and did so within
a reasonable time, and
whether the response was appropriate;
 
(c)   
Whether the tenant bears any responsibility for the issue(s);
and
 
(d)   Whether the tenant hindered or interfered with the landlord’s efforts to address
the issue(s).
 
20.  An abatement can be a lump sum or a percentage of
rent. In this case, I have determined
to grant an abatement based on a percentage of rent. In determining what percentage of rent is to be abated, I
considered the extent to which: (a) the issue(s) deprived the Tenant of her ability
to normally reside
in the rental unit; and (b)
the issue(s) impinges on the Tenant’s
use and enjoyment of the rental unit.
 
Hole of the Ceiling—$1,920.00
 
21.  The Tenants asserts
that a leak in the roof of the residential complex resulted in a hole in the ceiling of the rental
unit through which debris fell on a regular basis.
She asserts that the Landlord was aware of the hole in
July of 2019—the time he became aware of the leak that resulted in the hole—
and that the hole was not repaired until July of 2021.
 
22.  Ms Dias has no personal knowledge of the hole in the
ceiling, other than the fact it existed and that it was repaired in July of 2021.
The Landlord was not present
at the hearing to provide
evidence.
 
23. 
I accept
the Tenant’s evidence
and find that the Landlord was aware of the hole in the ceiling in July of 2020 and took no
steps to repair it until July of 202.
 
24. 
In connection with the hole in a ceiling an issue arises with respect
to the period for which the Tenant is entitled to claim an
abatement.
 
25.  Subsection 82 gives
rise to the ability of a tenant
to rely on matters that could have been raised on an
independent application under section 29, for example, on an L1 application
by a landlord.
 
26.  Effectively, section 82 allows a tenant to ‘take
shelter’ under an L1 application commenced by his or her landlord and raise
issues that could have been the subject of an independent application in that
L1. It promotes the expeditious and
cost-effective determination of the landlord’s claim
for unpaid rent and any counter-claim that the tenant




 
might have based on the conduct
of the landlord as is contemplated by section 2 of the
Statutory Powers
Procedures Act.
 
27.  Subsection 29(2) of the Act imposes a limitation
period on tenant application for relief under subsection 29(1). It provides that a tenant cannot bring an
application under subsection 29(1) more than one year after the day the issues
giving rise to the application occurred. [Act, s. 29(2). See also Toronto Community
Housing Corporation v Allan Vlahovich, 2010 ONSC 1686 (CanLII)]
 
28.  Limitation periods serve three purposes: (a) to
promote accuracy and certainty in the adjudication of claims; (b) to provide fairness to persons who might be required to defend
against claims based on stale evidence; and (c) to prompt persons who might
wish to commence claims to be diligent in pursuing them in a timely fashion”. [See Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Green, 2015 SCC 60 (CanLII),
para 57] The
expiry of a limitation period has the effect of
depriving a person of the ability to recover a claim that has become
statute-barred. [See Tolofson v.
Jensen 1994 CanLII 44 (SCC)]
 
29.  The application of subsection 29(2) where a tenant
has filed an independent application under section 29(1) is not
difficult. Subsection 29(2) clearly
provides that it prohibits a tenant from applying under section 29(1) more than
one year after the day the alleged conduct giving rise to that application
occurred. [Act, s. 29(2)]
 
30. 
Where, however,
a tenant relies on section 82 to
raise on an L1 an issue that could have been the subject of an independent
application under section 29(1), there is an issue as
to when a tenant’s
claim for an abatement, for lack of a better
expression, ‘anchors’ such
that the date for the determine the one-year ‘look-back’ referenced in subsection 20(2) is fixed—is it when the landlord
files the L1 application or when the tenant provides notification that he or she will
be raising issues pursuant to section
82? There is no clear answer in the Act and, in those
cases where the issue arises, the approach
of the Board appears to be
inconsistent.
 
31.  Some Members have interpreted the wording of
subsection 82(1) that requires that the Board ‘permit the tenant to raise any
issue that could be the subject of an application made by the tenant under this
Act’ provided that the tenant complies with certain notice requirements or
provides an explanation for not doing so as limiting the Board’s jurisdiction
to issues that relate to conduct that occurred within the one-year period prior
to the landlord notifying the landlord that he or she intends to rely on
section 82. [TSL- 82883-17 (Re), 2017 CanLII 28658
(ON LTB), TNL-96287-17 (Re), 2017 CanLII 142640 (ON LTB) and TSL-63981-15 (Re),
2016 CanLII 39872 (ON LTB)]1 Those
Members
effectively equate the tenant
providing notice, either in writing as contemplated by subsection 82(2)
or otherwise as contemplated by paragraph 82(1)(a)
as an ‘application’ by the tenant pursuant to subsection 29(1).
 
32.  In TNL-27161-20-RV (unreported) the Member considered subsection 135.1(2), which
is equivalent to subsection 29(2), and found that the tenant’s ‘filing’
of a claim pursuant section 82 is equivalent to the tenant filing an
application. There is, however, no

reference to what constitutes ‘filing’ of a claim by a tenant for the purposes
of section 82 and there is no reference in section 82
of the tenant having to ‘file a claim’ in order to raise issues on an L1
application.
 
33.  Other Members have found that the ‘anchor’
for the purposes
of the one-year limitation
period is the date the landlord files its L1 application. [See TSL-77928-16 (Re) [2017
CanLII 28623 (ON LTB), TET-90075-18
(Re) [2018 CanLII 113932 (ON LTB)], TST-
65783-15-RV (Re) [2018
CanLII 42887 (ON LTB)]
and Kotorobai v Frimpong, 2021 CanLII 91732 (ON LTB)]
 
34.  In Lopera v.
Margosutjahjo [2020 ONSC 7436 (CanLII)]
the Divisional Court dealt with a
case in which the tenant relied on section 82 to claim an abatement of rent
based on section 29. The Court
referenced subsection 29(2) and found that the Board had correctly determined
that the tenant was limited to issues arising ‘within the last year’, which
might refer to the one year prior to the landlords’ L1 application being filed,
although this is not explicitly stated.
 
35. 
I prefer
the position that it
is the filing by the landlord of an L1 application, not notice by the tenant that he or she will rely on
the right provided by section 82, that ‘anchors’ the
tenant’s claim and establishes the reference date for the one-year
limitation applicable to the issues that the tenant may raise
pursuant to section 82.
 
36.  In my view, the intention
of section 82 is to provide the tenant with the right to establish
a counter-claim or defense on an
L1 application and that
right arises on the filing of the
L1 by a landlord. Where issues
are raised by a tenant pursuant to section 82, there is only one application
that is before the Board—the landlord’s L1 application. It is the filing of that application that triggers rights under
section 82 and that is the ‘anchor’ for the one- year limitation period
applicable to the issues that the tenant may raise pursuant to section 82.
 
37.  The phrase ‘could be the subject of an application by
the tenant’ in subsection 82(1) incorporates,
in my view, the one-year
limitation period in, for example, subsection 29(2) on the conduct that a tenant may raise on an L1, but
cannot, in my view, be interpreted such that the notice the tenant provides that he or she will exercise rights under
section 82 is an ‘application’ for the purposes of ‘anchoring’ that limitation
period. The tenant’s statutory right
to raise the issues pursuant to section 82 arises on the making by a landlord
of an application pursuant to section 59 without the tenant having to bring an
application pursuant to, for example, section 29. The application on the one-year limitation period must, in my
view, reflect this fact.
 
38.  Given the effect of the operation of the one-year
limitation period on a tenant’s rights
and the intention of section 82, I
am unable to find that a
Board-imposed notice requirement, which can be waived by the Board2
thereby allowing the Board to fix on a case-by-case basis the date by which a
tenant is required to identify the issues he or she wishes to raise pursuant to
section 82, constitutes or rises to the level of an ‘application’ for the
purpose of subsection 29(2). Rule 19
of the Rules of Procedure is titled ‘Disclosure and


2 In TEL-67809-16-RV-IN2 (Re),
2016 CanLII 44305 (ON LTB) the Vice-Chair found
that ‘[i]t should also not be necessary for an unrepresented
tenant to say out loud the words “section 82” to claim this right’.




 
Evidence’ and
Rule 19.4 parallels Rule 19.1, which provides for the pre-hearing disclosure on an application that has been filed with the Board. The consequences of
failing to comply with Rule 19.4 are stated in Rule 19.7, which provides: ‘A party who fails
to comply with Rule 19 or an order or direction for disclosure may not rely on
the evidence that was not disclosed
as directed or ordered, unless otherwise ordered.’ This, in my view, supports my conclusion that the delivery of
information by a tenant pursuant
to Rule 19.4 of the Rules cannot be equated to an ‘application’ by the tenant for the purposes of subsection 29(2).
 
39.  In reaching my decision with respect to the ‘anchor’
applicable under section 82, I have considered the purposes served by a
limitation period. I believe that my
interpretation of what ‘anchors’ the one-year limitation period for tenant
claims under section 82 is consistent with the purposes of a limitation period. The alternate
approaches to the issue
taken by the Board are not materially different insofar as they both establish
an ‘anchor’ date for the one-year limitation period. In my view, the date of the ‘anchor’ is not a material issue in
terms of the general policy objective underlying a one-year limitation period
on tenant claims. In my view, using
the landlord’s L1 application as the ‘anchor’ for the one-year limitation
period fixes the ‘anchor’ date based on a readily-determinable and fixed
procedural event and that, in my view, promotes certainty in adjudicating claims.
 
40.  Having regard to the intention of section 82, there
is, in my view, no prejudice to the landlord the approach to section 82 that I
have adopted. A landlord who brings
an L1 application based on rent arrears should be aware that any counter-claims
or defenses the tenant has that relate to matters
within the one year
prior to the filing of the L1 may be raised on the application.
 
41.  There may
be a negative impact on the tenant if the L1
application is withdrawn. In
those circumstances, if more than one year has passed since the
conduct in issue occurred, the
tenant may be unable to obtain a remedy unless the tenant is permitted to
pursue his or her section 82 rights notwithstanding that the L1 has been
withdrawn. This possibility does not,
however, change my view as to how the on-year limitation period ought to be
applied where section 82 rights are relied upon by a tenant. The negative impact arises from the fact
that the tenant has elected to not file his or her own application. A tenant has the option of filing an
application pursuant to subsection 29(1) and, in relying on section 82 instead
of filing his or her own application, a tenant risks that the L1 application will be withdrawn possibly
leaving him or her without a direct remedy against the landlord.
 
42.  Applying the Act such that the notice the tenant is
required to give that he or she will exercise rights under 82 is the ‘anchor’
for the one-year limitation period does not eliminate this potential prejudice
to a tenant where the L1 is withdrawn. The
tenant will still have to file an application under subsection 29(1) if the L1 is withdrawn and the filing date of that application will
‘anchor’ the limitation period for the tenant’s application. 3
 












3 The only way to address this risk is to either in all circumstances
prohibit a landlord from withdrawing an L1 application
without the consent of the tenant or the Board or permit a tenant to pursue
section 82 issues notwithstanding that the L1 has been withdrawn.




 
 
 
43.  Going back 12 months from August of 2021, the Tenant would, in my view, be entitled to a rent abatement from August of 2020. However, in light of the statutory
suspension of limitation periods resulting from COVID, the Tenant can claim an abatement from July of 2020, the month when the leak in the roof caused the hole in
the ceiling.
 
44.  Based on the evidence, I find that the hole in the ceiling resulted in minimal disruption to the Tenant’s ability to normally reside in the rental unit
and there is no evidence that it impinged on the Tenant’s use and enjoyment of
the unit. The period of time that the
issue went unaddressed by the Landlord was, however, unacceptable. I find that the Tenant is entitled to a 10% abatement
or $160.00 per month from July of 2020 to July of 2021 (12X$160=$1,920.00).
 
Broken Fridge—$700.00
 
45.  The Tenant asserts that the fridge in the rental unit broke in January of 2021 and was replaced in July of 2021. She asserts
that the Landlord
made some attempts
to repair the fridge, but
those attempts were not timely or effective.
 
46.  Ms Dias does not dispute that the Tenant’s fridge was
not working, but has no personal knowledge as to when it stopped working, when
the Landlord became aware that it was not working or what, if any, steps were
taken by the Landlord to address the issue. Her
evidence is that when she personally became aware that the
fridge was not working, she arranged for a new fridge to be
delivered. That was in July of 2021. Ms Dias is not the Landlord and The
Landlord was not present at the hearing to provide evidence.
 
47.  I accept the Tenant’s evidence and find that she told
the Landlord that the fridge was
broken in January of 2021 and
that no timely
or effective steps were taken to address
the broken fridge until it was replaced in July of 2021.
 
48. 
I find that the Tenants bears
no responsibility for the broken fridge and did not hindered or interfered with the
Landlord’s efforts to address the issue.
 
49.  Based on the evidence, I find that there was some disruption to the tenant’s
ability to normally reside in
the rental unit caused by the broken fridge.
 
50.  The Tenant asserts that she lost $300 worth of food
per month as a result of the broken fridge, but provided no receipts or other
evidence to support that claim. I
also note that the Tenant was required by section 16 of the Act to take
reasonable steps to minimize her losses.
Continuing to buy perishable food and
storing it in a broken fridge week-after- week knowing that it would spoil is not, in my view, reasonable conduct on the part of the Tenant.
 
51.  Having regard to the impact the broken fridge had on
the Tenant, the delay in the Landlord effectively addressing the issue and
Tenant’s duty to mitigate, I find
that the Tenant is entitled
to a rent abatement of $100 per month from January of 2021 to July of 2021 (7X$100=$700.00) for the broken
fridge.




 
Rat Infestation—$2,560.00
 
52.  There is no dispute that there are rats in the rental unit and that the Landlord has been
aware of the rats since June of 2021. The
Tenant testified that the Landlord took no steps to address the infestation and
produced multiple pictures of what appear to be rather large rats that she
herself trapped in the rental unit.
 
53.  Ms Dias did not deny
there were rats in the rental unit, but attempted to attribute some of the blame for the
infestation on the Tenant. She
produced two pictures of debris she found behind the stove of the rental unit
when she moved it and asserts that the pest control company advised her that no treatment would
be effective until
the rental unit was
cleared of debris. However, Ms Dias
produced no evidence from the pest control company. The Tenant, for her part, asserts that the rental
unit was not unclean.
I accept the Tenant’s
evidence and find that she does not bear any responsibility for the rat infestation.
 
54.  Ms Dias asserted that the Tenant refused entry for
pest control, but the Tenant denies
this allegation. I accept the Tenant’s evidence
that she did not impede
or interfere with the Landlord’s efforts to address the
rat infestation—there is no evidence that the Landlord made any timely or
effective efforts to address the infestation.
 
55.  Based on the evidence, I find that the rat infestation
caused some disruption to the Tenant’s ability to normally reside in the rental
unit and the infestation partially impinged upon the Tenant’s use and enjoyment
of the rental unit. I find that the
Tenant is entitled to a rent abatement of 20% or $320 per month from June of
2021 until January of 2022 (8X$320=$2,560.00).       I also find that the Tenant
is entitled to an
ongoing rent abatement of
$320.00 per month (or $10.52 per day) until she vacates the rental unit.
 
Illegal Entry—$0
 
56.  The Tenant asserts that the Landlord, specifically Ms
Dias, illegally entered the rental unit. Based on the evidence
before me, I am unable
to find that there was an illegal
entry and am not prepared to grant a rent abatement.
 
57.  The uncontroverted evidence
before me was that the Landlord had the verbal
consent to enter the unit for the purposes of dealing with the rat
infestation. The Tenant’s issue
appears to be not the fact that Ms Dias entered the rental unit, but that she
moved the stove and took pictures. Ms Dias
asserts that the pictures were taken
in connection with addressing the rat infestation. I find that the actions of the Landlord do not constitute either
an illegal entry or substantial interference and I am not prepared to grant a
rent abatement.
Locked Thermostat—$0
 
58.  The Tenant asserts that the Landlord locked the
thermostat so that she cannot change the temperature in the rental
unit. The Landlord’s position is that this was done because the thermostat in the unit
controls the temperature in other units in the residential complex.




 
59.  The evidence before me was that the Tenant found the temperature in the unit during the Summer ‘a little bit chilly’ and that
the temperature during the Winter has been ‘reasonable’. I find that the actions of the Landlord in locking the thermostat
do not constitute either a denial of vital services or substantial interference
and I am not prepared to grant a rent abatement.
 
Summary
 
60.  I find that the Tenant is entitled
to the following rent abatement/rebate of rent:
 



Hole in the Ceiling


$1,920.00




Broken Fridge


$    700.00




Rat Infestation


$2,560.00




Illegal Entry


$0




Locked Thermostat


$0




TOTAL


$5,180.00



 
III.         
Section 83 Considerations
 
61.  Having found that the Landlord breached his obligation under subsection 20(1) of the Act, I must consider
whether the Landlord’s breach is ‘serious’ such that paragraph
83(3)(a) of the Act applies. That
provision provides:
 
83 (3)
Without restricting the generality of subsection (1), the Board
shall refuse to grant
the application where satisfied that,
 
(a) the landlord is in serious
breach of the landlord’s responsibilities under this Act or of any material covenant in the tenancy
agreement;…
 
62. 
Having considered the nature and extent
of the Landlord’s breach, I find that it
was not ‘serious’ such that I
am required to refuse to grant the L1 application.
 
63.  I am also required by subsection 83(2) of the Act to
consider all of the relevant circumstances,
including the Landlord’s breach of its obligations under subsection 20(1), to assess whether I should:
(a) refuse to grant the application;
(b) order that the eviction be
postponed; and/or (c) impose conditions on the Tenant or the Landlord.
 
64.  The Tenant has lived
in the rental unit for four years.
She lives alone.
 
65.  The Tenant was for a period of time under-employed as
a result of health issues and during that period
she was not earning sufficient income to pay her rent. The Tenant
has, however, now recovered and is working full time and earning
sufficient money to pay the
$1,600.00 in rent. She is not, however, earning
sufficient to immediately repay the arrears or
make significant payments against the arrears.




 
66.  The Landlord did not personally attend before the Board to provide evidence
or to explain what, if any, impact permitting the Tenant with a period
of time to find alternative accommodations would have on him.
 
67.  The Tenant indicates that she can afford to pay
$250.00 per month towards the
arrears. Considering the rent abatement of $5,180.00, it would take the
Tenant 18 months to pay the arrears
owing to the Landlord. The Landlord has indicated that this is not acceptable and I am not, in the
circumstances, prepared to impose an 18-month repayment plan on the Landlord.
 
68.  I do not believe, in all of the circumstances, that it
is unfair to evict the Tenant. I do,
however, find that it is not unfair t provide the Tenant with additional time over
the Winter to locate alternative
accommodations. I am ordering, pursuant to paragraph 83(1)(b) of the Act, that
the eviction of the Tenant is delayed under April 30, 2022,
provided that the Tenant pays ‘occupation’ rent for February, March and
April, 2022. I am imposing the
condition that the Tenant pay occupation rent based on my
jurisdiction under subsection 204(1) of the Act. I am ordering that the failure of the Tenant to pay occupation rent will be subject to section 78 of the Act. What this means
is that the Landlord will be able to obtain from the Board an
order evicting the Tenant prior to April 30, 2022 without notice to the
Tenant if the Tenant does not pay the ordered ‘occupation’ rent.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
April 30, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4,457.41*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January 31, 2022,
less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit
and less the amount
of the rebate the Landlord
owes the Tenant.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,280, which represents the monthly rent less the abatement granted in connection with
the rat infestation, on or before each of February 10, 2022, March 1, 2022 and
April 1, 2022.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$42.08 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting May 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before April 30, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from May 1, 2022,
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.




 
7.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before April 30, 2022, then starting May 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 1, 2022.
 
9.    
Subject to paragraph 4 of this order, if the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
 
(a)          
$6,206.00 if the payment
is made on or before January
31, 2022, or
 
(b)          
$9,674.00 if the payment
is made on or before
April 30, 2022**.
 
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph
and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
10.  Notwithstanding anything else in this order, if the
Tenant fails to make any one of the payments
in accordance with paragraph
3 of this order the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to the Board
pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and
evicting the Tenant.
 
11.  The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this
order if they pay the amount required under that
subsection on or after May 1, 2022, but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.

2.  
An order determining that the

the tenancy agreement
or deliberately interfered with the reasonable supply of any vital service, care service or
food.
 
3.  
An order determining that the landlord,
superintendent or agent of the landlord has substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex for all usual
purposes by the tenant or a member of his or her household.

tenant replacement keys.
 
6.  
An order determining that the landlord,
superintendent or agent of the landlord has illegally entered the rental unit.
 
(2) No application may be made under subsection (1) more than one year after the day the alleged conduct giving rise to the

…
2. Order an abatement of rent.
…
5.  
Order the landlord to pay a specified sum to the tenant for,

result of the landlord’s breach, and
 
ii.    other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
that the tenant has incurred
or will incur
as a result of the landlord’s
breach.

that amount; and

under subsection (11) during the period of the

the period of the
agreement.
 
…
 
(11)  
A
tenant may make a motion
to the Board, on notice to the landlord, to set aside
an eviction order referred to
in subsection (3) if, after the order becomes enforceable but before it is
executed, the tenant pays an amount
to the landlord or to the Board and files an
affidavit sworn by the tenant stating that the
amount, together with any amounts
previously paid to the landlord or to the Board, is at least the sum of the
following amounts:
 
1.  
The amount of rent that is in arrears
under the tenancy
agreement.
2.   The
amount of additional rent that would have been due under the tenancy
agreement as at the date of
payment by the tenant had notice of termination not been given.

charged by financial institutions to the landlord in respect of cheques tendered
to the landlord by or on behalf
of the tenant, as allowed

amount of administration charges payable

87.

tenant’s tenancy agreement with the landlord.
2
 
(13)  
An order under subsection (3) is stayed
when a motion under subsection (11) is accepted
for filing by the Board and shall not be enforced
under this Act or as an order of the Superior Court
of Justice during the stay.
 
82 (1) At a hearing of an
application by a landlord under section 69 for an
order terminating a tenancy and evicting a tenant based on a notice of
termination under section 59, the Board
shall permit the tenant to raise any issue that could be the subject of an application made by the tenant
under this Act if the tenant,
 
(a)    
complies with the requirements set out in subsection (2); or
(b)    
provides an explanation satisfactory to the Board
explaining why the tenant could
not comply with the requirements set out in subsection (2).

of the issue that it could have made had the tenant made an application
under this Act.
 
83 (1)
Upon an application for an order evicting a tenant, the Board may, despite any other
provision of this Act or the tenancy agreement,
 
(a)  
 refuse to grant the application unless
satisfied, having regard
to all the circumstances, that it would be unfair to refuse; or

landlord is in serious breach
of the landlord’s responsibilities under this Act or of any

 the reason for the application
being brought is that the tenant has complained to a governmental authority of the landlord’s violation of a law dealing
