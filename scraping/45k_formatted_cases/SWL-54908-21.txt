Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-54908-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1316 GAINSBOROUGH ROAD LONDON ON N6H5K8


 




Between:


Bellamere Developments Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jeffery Shields Patricia Shields


Tenants



 
 
 
Bellamere Developments Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Jeffery Shields
and Patricia Shields (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 20, 2021. The Landlord’s Agent, M.
Palumbo, the Landlord's Legal Representative, John Edlund, and Jeffery Shields,
on behalf of both
Tenants, attended the hearing.
 
Preliminary Issues:
 
The Tenants intended
to raise issues
pursuant to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006.
However, neither the Board nor the Landlord was informed prior to the hearing.
As the Landlord was not informed and therefore unprepared to respond to the
allegations, the issues were not considered. This does not prevent the Tenants
from filing their own application at a future date.
 
The Tenants also requested an adjournment to afford them the
opportunity of speaking with Duty Counsel who were not present at the time the
application was called. The Landlord opposed the Tenants’ request.
 
Section 183 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 provides that “The Board
shall adopt the most
expeditious method of determining the questions arising
in a proceeding that affords
to all persons directly affected by the proceeding an adequate
opportunity to know the issues and be heard on the matter”.
 
The Notice of Hearing, which was mailed
to the Tenants on October
7, 2021, states
amongst other things, “If
you are a Tenant and wish to obtain legal advice, contact your local community
legal clinic. To find your local legal clinic, contact Legal Aid Ontario at
1-800-668-8258. Please seek legal
advice PRIOR to your hearing”. Given that the Notice of Hearing was mailed
on October 7, 2021, I am satisfied
that the Tenants had sufficient time
to seek legal advice prior to the
hearing




 
and it would be prejudicial to adjourn the hearing in the
circumstance. As a result, the Tenants’ request was denied.
 
The amount outstanding for the period ending
January 14, 2022 ($36,186.00, inclusive of the cost of filing the application) exceeds
the $35,000.00 monetary jurisdiction of the Board. The Landlord was informed, and agreed that by proceeding with this application, all rights the Landlord may have
in excess of the Board’s monetary jurisdiction are extinguished on issuance of
this order.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from January 15, 2020 to January
14, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 10, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,500.00.
 
4.     
The Tenants
have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     
The Landlord sent
letters to the Tenants on the necessity of a repayment agreement. The
Landlord’s attempts at negotiating a repayment agreement were unsuccessful.
 
6.     
The Tenant testified
that they have resided in the rental unit for 12 years, with their adult son.
The Tenants, who also run a business from the rental unit, stated that their
business was impacted by the pandemic, but they hoped for a turn around in the
new year. The Tenant proposed a plan to pay $1,500.00 towards the arrears
each month in addition to the monthly rent. Considering the Tenants failure to pay the rent for over
a year, I am not satisfied that they can comply with a conditional order for
payments.
 
7.     
The Landlord
is not holding a last month's rent deposit.
 
8.     
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the
Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant and find
that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The
amount outstanding is substantial, and the Tenants have not paid any rent since
the application was filed.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental
unit on or before January 18, 2022.
 
2.    
As of January 07, 2022,
the Tenants owe the Landlord 35,700.59*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
7, 2022. However, the Board is




 
only authorized
to order the Tenants to pay the maximum of its monetary
jurisdiction of
$35,000.00. Therefore, the Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
the amount of $35,000.00.
 
3.    
The Tenants would also
normally be ordered to pay to the Landlord $49.32 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
January 8, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit. Having exceeded the Board’s monetary
jurisdiction of $35,000.00 this amount of daily compensation will therefore not
be awarded.
 
4.    
The Tenants would have
normally been ordered to pay the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing the
application. Having exceeded the Board’s monetary jurisdiction of $35,000.00
the cost of filing the application will therefore not be awarded.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 18, 2022, the
Tenants will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January 19, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord, on or after January 19, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to
void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord
or to the Board in trust
the amount of $35,000.00 which is
the maximum limit of the
Board’s monetary jurisdiction. This
payment must be made by January 18, 2022. If
the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by
the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after January 19, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
