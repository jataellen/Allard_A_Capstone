and


 




 


Michael
A. Lewis


Tenant



 
 
 
510 Dawes Apartments Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Michael A. Lewis (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on September 21, 2021at 9:00 a.m.
 
Only the Landlord,
represented by Natasha
Mizzi, a licensed
Paralegal, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
November 1, 2020 to September
30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
November 26, 2020.
 
2.    
The Tenant
was in possession of the rental unit when the application was
filed.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is
$1,093.78
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,093.78 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 1998 to November 26, 2020.
 
6.    
The Tenant
paid $6,446.58 after the application was filed.
 
7.    
This hearing
was adjourned from June 23, 2021 in order to allow the Tenant to prepare
for submissions to the Board.




 
8.    
The Landlord’s representative submitted that the Tenant
has not complied
with the Interim Order issued
August 11, 2021
 
9.    
As of the hearing
date, the Tenant owed the Landlord, $3,970.82
including arrears of rent
to September 30, 2021 of $3,784.82 and the application fee of $186.00. Since
the hearing, another four rental periods have begun, and four more month’s rent
have become due. Therefore, the amount in this order includes October 2021,
November 2021, December 2021, and January 2022’s rent. If the Tenant has paid
the Landlord October 2021, November 2021,December 2021, and January 2022’s
rent, and /or made any payments to the Landlord since the hearing, the
Landlord shall deduct those payments from the amount owing in this order.
 
10. 
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
The Tenant did not attend the
hearing to present evidence or submissions in support of granting relief from eviction
and no circumstances were disclosed at the hearing or appeared in the
Board file.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 23, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $6,609.16*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
12, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$35.96 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 13, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
23, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 24, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 23, 2022, then starting January
24, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 24, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 23, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $8,345.94** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment




 
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that
the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
24, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
