Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-24336-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


912, 55 TRILLER AVENUE TORONTO ON M6R2H6


 




Between:


IMH POOL
XX


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Richard Krease


Tenant



 
 
 
IMH POOL XX (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Richard Krease (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 12, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Tricia Radam, attended the hearing. As of 10:09 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
13, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,253.29.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,228.04 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit has been paid to the Tenant for the period from July 21, 2020 to December 31, 2020.
 
6.    
The Tenant paid $6,266.45
after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the




File Number: TSL-24336-21
 
Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 8, 2022.
 
2.     As of the date of this order,
the amount of the rent deposit exceeds
the arrears of rent
and compensation the Landlord is entitled to by $431.95*.
 
3.     However, the Landlord
is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenant: $41.20
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 20, 2022 to
the date the Tenant moves out of the unit, and $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.     The Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 8, 2022, then starting
February 9, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 9, 2022.
 
7.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$1,439.29 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$2,692.58 if the payment
is made on or before
February 8, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 9, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
