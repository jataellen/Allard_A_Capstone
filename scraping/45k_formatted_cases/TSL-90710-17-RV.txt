Order under Section 21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-90710-17-RV










 
 

Review Order
 
H.I.I.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict O.O
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges and related administration
charges.
 
This
application was resolved by order TSL-90710-17 issued on January 19, 2018.
 
On
January 24, 2018, the Tenant requested a review of the order, and that the
order be stayed until the review is resolved.
 
On
January 25, 2018, interim order TSL-90710-17-IN was issued, staying the order
issued on January 19, 2018.
 
The
request was heard in Toronto on March 7, 2018.
 
The
Landlord’s representative, C.K, and the Tenant attended the hearing.
            
Determinations:
 
Review
1.      The
Tenant’s request for a review of order TSL-90710-17 is based
on the grounds of not being reasonably able to participate in the proceedings.
2.      The
hearing that gave rise to order TSL-90710-17
took place on January 15, 2018. The Tenant did not attend that hearing. 
3.      At the
review hearing, the Tenant testified that on January 15, 2018 she attended at
the Board’s office at 79 St. Clair Avenue East but that she arrived late and
her hearing had already been held. The Tenant testified that she was told by
Board staff that the Landlord was no longer on the premises. 
4.      The
Tenant’s explanation for why she arrived late is incoherent, internally
inconsistent and generally not credible. For instance, she testified that she
left home at 8:30am on the date of the hearing, took a bus and a taxi, and
arrived at a “courthouse” at 555 University, or 555 Yonge or 555 Bay (this
address changed throughout her testimony) at 11:30am. This makes no sense. The
Tenant also testified that staff at this “courthouse” told her where her
hearing was to take place even though the Tenant did not have her notice of
hearing with her at the time. It does not make sense that an office other than
a Board office would direct the Tenant to the address of the Toronto South
District Office of the Board. 
5.      Notwithstanding
these obvious problems with the Tenant’s explanation for being late on the date
of the hearing, I granted the Tenant’s request for a review. The Tenant
testified she came to the Board’s office late and missed her hearing. Although
her testimony for her reason for being late appears incredulous, the fact that
she came to the Board that day is not contested with any evidence. The Landlord
testified that she was at the Board all day on January 15, 2018 but it is still
conceivable that the Tenant attended and was told by staff that the hearing had
been completed and the Landlord has left. 
6.      The
Divisional Court has found that the grounds of “not reasonably able to
participate” must be interpreted broadly. Interpreting these grounds broadly in
the context of the Tenant’s testimony that she came to the Board office late
and missed her hearing, I must find that the Tenant was not reasonably able to
participate in the proceedings.
7.      The
Landlord’s L1 application was heard de novo.
L1
application
8.      The
Landlord’s position is that the Tenant owes $4,291.99 to March 31, 2018. 
9.      At
the hearing the Tenant disputed this amount but did not say what the amount
should be. The Tenant acknowledged not having made any payments in 2018 other
than a payment of $1,000.00 in February 2018 which was acknowledged by the
Landlord. The Tenant gave no evidence to show any other payments to the
Landlord. The Tenant ordinarily pays her rent by cheque or money order, and so
documentary evidence of her payments would be readily available.
10.   At
the hearing the Landlord presented a ledger showing the rent charged to the
Tenant and payments made by the Tenant from January 1, 2016 to December 31,
2017 (payments in 2018 were not in dispute). The ledger shows that the claimed
amount in the Landlord’s application is off by $0.09. As this is a trivial
amount, I have amended the application to reflect the real amount owed.
11.   This
$0.09 discrepancy affects the N4 notice of termination, as it means the N4
notice does not accurately state the amount owed. However, it is a trivial
amount which would not have affected the Tenant’s ability or decision to void
the N4 notice by paying the rent owed. I therefore find the N4 notice to be in
substantial compliance with the requirements of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). I note that to find otherwise, in the full
circumstances of this case, would be grossly unfair to the Landlord. 
12.   As
the Tenant gave no evidence to contradict the Landlord’s ledger, at the hearing
I found, on a balance of probabilities, that the Tenant owes $4,291.90 in
arrears to March 31, 2018. 
13.   The
Landlord incurred charges of $7.00 for a cheque tendered by or on behalf of the
Tenant, which was returned NSF and $20.00 for related administration charges.
14.   The
Tenant also owes the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
The full amount owing is $4,508.90.
15.   The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $869.41 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
16.   Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 1,
2017 to November 22, 2017.
17.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act, other than to postpone the eviction.
18.   At
the hearing the Tenant proposed a payment plan whereby the amount owed would be
paid off in approximately two years. This plan would prejudice the Landlord.
The Tenant cannot afford any more accelerated payment plan and so a payment
plan is not feasible in this case. 
19.   The
Tenant has a 9 year old child who lives with her in the rental unit. For this
reason I have extended the termination date.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Order
TSL-90710-17 issued on January 19, 2018 is cancelled and replaced by the
following: 
2.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before March 31, 2018.
3.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,786.37*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to March 9, 2018 and the total charges related
to a NSF cheque tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant, less
the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $28.58 per day for compensation for the use
of the unit starting March 10, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
5.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before March 31, 2018, then starting April 1, 2018,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 1, 2018.
8.      If,
on or before March 31, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $4,508.90** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after April 1, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
