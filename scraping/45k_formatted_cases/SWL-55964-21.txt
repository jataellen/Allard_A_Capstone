Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55964-21
 



In the
  matter of:


105, 3650 SANDWICH STREET WINDSOR ON N9C1B7


 




Between:


Ambassador Property Management Inc.


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Donald Westlake


Tenant



 
Ambassador Property Management
Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Donald Westlake (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that
the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 27, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative,
Luisa Goncalves, attended the hearing. As of 10:19 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from October 1, 2020 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective October 13, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $660.65.
 
4.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $660.65
from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from July 1, 2020 to
October 13, 2021.
 
6.    
The Tenant paid $2,640.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 15, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $2,703.30*, which represents
the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
4, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$21.72 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 5, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 15, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 15, 2022, then starting February
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 16, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 15, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $4,095.61** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this
order for eviction will be void. This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if the Tenant pays the amount
required under that subsection on or after February 16, 2022 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to
make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
