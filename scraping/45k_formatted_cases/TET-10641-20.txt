File Number: TET-10641-20
 
 



In the
  matter of:


FRONT, 770 MORRISH
ROAD TORONTO ON M1C1G3


 




Between:


Roma Wojtowycz


Tenant




 


 
and


 




 


Rhonda
Gold


Landlord



 
 
Roma Wojtowycz
(the ‘Tenant’) applied
for an order that Rhonda
Gold (the ‘Landlord’) had given a notice of
termination in bad faith.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on October 12, 2021.
 
The Tenant’s
Legal Representative Kimberley Covey, the Tenant
and the Landlord
attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord served an
N12 notice of termination in April 2019, for own use with a termination date of August
31, 2019. That was resolved
by Board order TEL-00788-19-
AM issued September 26, 2019.
 
2.    
It was uncontested that
the Tenant vacated as of September 11, 2019.
The Tenant moved out of the rental
unit because the Landlord gave the Tenant
a notice of termination
claiming the Landlord required possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
It was uncontested that the Landlord re-rented the unit effective October
1, 2019 with a new rent amount of $1,575.00. Further,
it was uncontested that the Landlord has listed
the rental unit for sale April 2020.
 
4.    
The Landlord stated
that she decided to help a friend by renting the unit, rather than expand her business, and that the house had been taken off the market when it did not
sell.
 
5.    
I am satisfied that the Landlord
gave the Tenant
the notice in bad faith.
The unit had been
rented within weeks of the tenant vacating, and subsequently listed for sale. These actions clearly show that the
Landlord did not intend to expand her growing business as was the reasons given
in serving the N12 notice.
