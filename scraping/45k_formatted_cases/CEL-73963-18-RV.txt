Review and Motion Order
 
IS (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict ZSP and BH (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe (L1 application).
 
The Landlord’s L1 application was resolved by order
CEL-73963-18 issued on April 13, 2018.
The Tenants requested a review of that order.
 
On May 22, 2018 interim order CEL-73963-18-RV-IN was
issued staying the order issued on April 13, 2018.
 
The Landlord also filed an L4 application for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants and for an order to have the
Tenants pay the rent they owe because they failed to meet a condition specified
in prior order CEL-73963-18 issued on April 13, 2018.
 
The Landlord's L4 application was resolved ex parte
(without a hearing) by order CEL-76175-18, issued on May 24, 2018. The Tenants
filed a motion to set aside or cancel that order.
 
The Tenants’ review request and the Tenants’ motion
were heard together in Mississauga on June 15, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant, ZP,
attended the hearing. The Landlord’s husband, ZS, assisted the Landlord at the
hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
The Tenants’ Review Request
1.     
There is a serious error in order CEL-73963-18 issued on April 13, 2018. The Member who heard
that application assumed that the rent was due in full on the 22nd
day of the month.
2.     
However, the monthly rent is paid bi-monthly on
the 22nd and 8th of the month. A copy of the written
tenancy agreement was presented at the hearing which confirms these payment
dates.
3.     
The payment plan the Member ordered requires the
Tenants to pay the full monthly rent in advance on the 22nd of each
month instead of half on the 22nd and half on the 8th.
This impacted on the Tenants’ ability to fully comply with the ordered payment
plan.
4.     
Due to the serious error, the Tenants’ review
request was granted at the review hearing and the Landlord’s L1 application was
re-heard.
The Tenants’ Motion
5.     
The error in the original payment plan order led
to the Tenants’ failure to fully comply with the ordered payments. Also, the
amount of monthly rent claimed in the L4 application is incorrect for the
reasons that are explained below. The ex parte eviction order issued on May 24,
2018 requires the Tenants to pay more rent than they lawfully owe. Therefore,
the Tenants’ motion is granted and the order is cancelled and replaced with
this order.
6.     
The Tenants made two payment after the April 13th
order was issued. They paid the Landlord $2,050 on April 22, 2018 and $1,173.00
on May 4, 2018. No payments have been made since that time. This is not
disputed.
7.     
After the Tenants filed their review the payment
plan order was stayed or put on hold by the interim order that was issued and
the Tenants did not make any more of the ordered payments because they expected
the payment plan that had been ordered to be varied to reflect the correct dates
the rent is due and payable.
The Amount of the Lawful Rent
8.     
The lawful monthly rent is
$1,990.00.
9.     
When the tenancy began in August
2015 the monthly rent was $1,990.00.
10.  
There is no dispute that the
Landlord increased the rent by $60.00 to $2,050.00 and that there was no 90 day
written notice of the rent increase as required by section 116 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).
11.  
Subsection 116(4) of the Act
states a rent increase is void if the Landlord has not given the required 90
day notice. 
12.  
The rent increase of $60.00 which
increased the rent to $2,050.00 is void. As a result of the void increase, the
lawful monthly rent returns to the original amount of $1,990.00. This amount is
due and payable bi-monthly with $995.00 due on the 22nd of the month
and $995.00 due on the 8th of the month.
13.  
The Tenants have paid the
$60.00 rent increase in four of the past months. This amounts to an overpayment
of $240.00 ($60.00 x 4). This overpayment is credited to the amount of rent
arrears owing.
14.  
The Landlord argued that the
Tenants agreed to the rent increase. This is irrelevant. Section 3 of the Act
makes it clear that the Act applies despite any agreement or waiver to the
contrary. Section 4 states that any part of a tenancy agreement that conflicts
with the Act is void. These sections ensure that parties cannot simply contract
out of their rights and responsibilities under the Act. 
The Rent Arrears Owing
15.  
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent they were required to pay for the period from January 22, 2018
to June 21, 2018. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a N4 Notice of
Termination effective February 26, 2018.
16.  
All of the payments the
Tenants have made are reflected and credited in the Landlord’s rent ledger.
17.  
At the review hearing, the
rent arrears owing were calculated based on the lawful rent of $1,990.00 and
subtracting the credit for the overpaid rent as well as the other payments the
Tenants have made. There is no dispute that the rent arrears owing to June 21,
2018 are $4,777.00.
18.  
The Tenants also owe the
Landlord $190.00 for the fee to file the L1 rent arrears application.
19.  
The total amount owing to
the Landlord up to June 21, 2018 is $4,967.00 ($4,777.00 + $190.00). An
additional half month of rent at $995.00 comes due on June 22, 2018.
Relief from Eviction
20.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act and find
that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act. 
21.  
The Tenants have resided in the rental unit
since 2015. They have four children. The rent arrears accumulated because both
Tenants lost time off work over the past year due to health issues. Both Tenants
are back at work full time and now have sufficient income to cover the ongoing
rent and the arrears payments.
22.  
The Landlord is concerned that the Tenants
cannot afford the rent and utilities for the rental unit and believes she will
not get the proposed payments. The prejudice to the Landlord is minimized
because she can request to end the tenancy if the payments ordered below are
not paid in full or on time.
23.  
The payments ordered below were discussed at the
hearing. The Tenants were made aware of their obligation to begin the payments
as of June 22nd even if they have not received this order in the
mail by that date.
It is ordered that:
 
1.
