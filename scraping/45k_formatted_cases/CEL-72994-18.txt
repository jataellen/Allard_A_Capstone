Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-72994-18











 
 

SS (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict DM and AM (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay
the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Mississauga on March 7,
2018.
 
The Landlord's Legal
Representative, LD and the Tenants’ Legal Representative, SS attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations and Reasons:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent they were required to pay for the period from January 1, 2018 to
March 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective January 18, 2018.
2.     
The Landlord's Legal
Representative requests eviction 11 days after the order issue date, a standard
order.  She submitted that there have been two prior Board orders and this is
the third time the Landlord has come to the Board regarding rent arrears.  As a
consequence, it is very prejudicial to the Landlord to consider relief from
eviction.
3.     
The Tenants’ Legal
Representative submitted that the Tenants are seeking a payment plan.  She
advised the Board that the Tenants have used their one time voiding option
already.  The Tenants’ Legal Representative submitted that one of the Tenants
receives disability benefits but the other Tenants are now gainfully employed
and they seek a last chance to preserve the tenancy.  There are five adults
living in the unit and the tenancy commenced in April 2016.
4.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act for the following
reasons:
5.     
Board Order CEL-68256-17 was
issued on August 14, 2017 based on the consent of the parties.  At that time
rent arrears to August 31, 2017 including the application cost were $9,440.00.
6.     
Board Order CEL-70342-17 was
issued on November 3, 2017 based on the parties’ consent.  The arrears to
November 30, 2017 were $5,500.00.
7.     
The Landlord has now filed
an application for rent owed from January 1, 2018 to March 31, 2018.
8.     
I acknowledge the
submissions from the Tenants’ Legal Representative that the Tenants’ parents
are disabled, elderly and have medical resources close to the rental unit. 
However the evidence does not demonstrate that the tenancy is sustainable. 
This is the third application regarding rent owing in the last six months.
There have been no payments from the Tenants since the application was filed on
January 4, 2018 and the amount owing is substantial ($5,550).
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenants void the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before March
25, 2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $4,439.89*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to March 14, 2018.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $60.82 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
March 15, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March 25, 2018, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from March
26, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 25, 2018, then starting March 26, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 26, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before March 25,
2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $5,740.00** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March 26,
2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
