Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44705-22
 
 



In the
  matter of:


004, 147 MISSISSAUGA AVENUE ELLIOT LAKE ON P5A1E3


 




Between:


Ppg Management Corp


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Dawn Fralick


Tenant



 
 
 
Ppg Management Corp (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Dawn Fralick (the 'Tenant') and for an order
to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on August 26,
2021 with respect to application NOL-42478-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I
find that the Tenant has not met the following condition specified in the
order: The Tenant did not pay $525.00 rent on or before January
1, 2022. The Tenant did not pay $200.00 arrears on or before
January 15, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $2,861.00 for rent arrears
and NSF cheque charges and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee
in Order NOL-42478-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $2,261.00
and that amount
is included in this order.
As a result, the previous order NOL-42478-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from February 1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.




File Number: NOL-44705-22
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     Order NOL-42478-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 19, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,537.16*. (less
any amount paid since the application was filed on January 26, 2022.) This
amount represents the rent owing up to February 8, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the previous application.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $17.26 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 9, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 19, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
February 20, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 19, 2022, then starting February
20, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 20, 2022.

The tenant has until February 18, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by February 18, 2022
the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on August 20, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
