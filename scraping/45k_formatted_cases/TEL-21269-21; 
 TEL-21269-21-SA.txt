Order under Section 78(11)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-21269-21-SA
 
 



In the matter
of:


D, 101 PETERSON STREET TRENTON ON K8V5P8


 




Between:


Sonya Mitts


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Derek Siemens


Tenant



 
 
 
Sonya Mitts (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Derek Siemens
(the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because
the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on December 1, 2021 with respect to
application TEL-18934-21.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved
by order TEL-21269-21, issued on January
19, 2022. The Tenant filed a motion to set aside
order TEL-21269-21.
 
This motion
was heard by video conference on February 16, 2022. The Landlord, the
Landlord's Legal Representative, L. McCullough and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
The Tenant spoke with
Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
Order TEL-18934-21 provided that the Landlord
could apply to the Board under section
78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and
evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain conditions specified in the
order.
 
2.     The Landlord filed the application under section 78 of the Act, alleging
that the Tenant
failed to pay the monthly rent on December 1, 2021, and arrears of
$478.60 on December 15, 2021, contrary to the order. This resulted in ex parte
order TEL-21269-21 terminating the tenancy.
 
3.    
In support of the motion to set
aside the order, the Tenant testified that he failed to make the payments
because he recently gained employment at a new place and the set up of the
payroll was delayed. The Tenant sent the Landlord a letter regarding the delay
of the payment on December
1, 2021 and the Landlord graciously accepted
the late payment
on or about December 4, 2021, although they did not anticipate that the
issue would not be




File Number: TEL-21269-21-SA
 
resolved by December 15, 2021.
The Tenant, who has resided in the rental unit for over four years, did make
all the payments in December 2021.
 
4.     The Landlord opposed
the Tenant’s motion
stating that not only did the Tenant breach the order, but the Tenant was also untruthful in his filed motion when he stated that the payment
of the arrears on December 15, 2021 was made on time.
 
5.     Based on all the evidence, there is no dispute that
the Tenant breached the order. While
the Landlord permitted the late payment on December 1, 2021, the Tenant did breach the
order by failing to make the arrears payment on December 15, 2021.
 
6.    
Although the
Tenant breached the order, section 78(11)(b) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 provides that the Board shall set aside the eviction order if the Board is satisfied,
having regard to all the circumstances, that it would not be unfair to do so. The Tenant did ultimately end up making the payments
in December 2021 and has since then complied with the terms of order TEL-18934-21. In these
circumstances, I find it would not be
unfair to set aside order TEL-21269-21.
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The motion to set aside order TEL-21269-21, issued on January
19, 2022, is granted. The order cannot be enforced by the
Landlord.
 
2.     The order issued by the Board on December 1, 2021 with
respect to application TEL- 18934-21, continues in effect.
