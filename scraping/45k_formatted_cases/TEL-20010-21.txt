Properties LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Haydan Dagnall and Suzanne Calis (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants

although properly served

2.     The Tenants were in possession of the rental
unit when the Landlord file the application.
 
3.    
The lawful monthly rent is $1,139.49.
