File Number: TEL-21217-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


211, 220 PERRY
STREET WHITBY ON L1N9H6


 




Between:


Durham Region Non

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jennifer
Purdy


Tenant



 
 
 
Durham Region Non Profit Housing
Corp (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jennifer
Purdy (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued
by the Board on September 22, 2021
with respect to application TEL-15979-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the
Tenant has not met the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenant was not to make excessive noise to the level that leads
to a complaint that substantially interferes with another Tenants reasonable
enjoyment of the residential complex. On November 23, 2021 the Tenant was heard
screaming and was unclothed in the hallway
at 7:30 am. On November 26-28
the Tenant was heard
screaming again in the hallways
for most of the weekend.
On November 29, 2021 at 2:40 am the Tenant again was yelling
and swearing in the hallway. On November 29,
2021 the Tenant
was swearing and yelling at the superintendent on duty. On the
way out of the building
the Tenant said she poured water on the stove because she smelled gas. The staff entered the
unit due to the gas smell and found no odour
but the stove was completely wet and water was pooled on the floor.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TEL-15979-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 24, 2022.

25, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
4.

of this order, the Court

vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 25, 2022.

the Board will schedule a hearing.
