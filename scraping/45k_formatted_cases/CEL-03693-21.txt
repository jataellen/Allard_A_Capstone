Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number:
CEL-03693-21




 
In the matter
  of:


 
5,
  29 DUNKERRON AVENUE WASAGA BEACH ON L9Z2H4


 




Between:


Joe (Giuseppe) Latino


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Peggy Sindrey


Tenant



 
 
 
Joe (Giuseppe) Latino (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Peggy
Sindrey (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires the rental unit to be
vacant in order to do repairs
or renovations so extensive that he is required to get a building permit and
the rental unit must be vacant to do
the work.
 
This application was heard
via videoconference on January 6, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s legal representative, Adele Porco, and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
The Tenant was assisted at the hearing by Tenant Duty Counsel, Susanne
Cooper.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
For the following reasons, we find
that the Landlord’s application must be dismissed. There is no dispute that the
Landlord paid to the Tenant one month compensation on October 1, 2021. However,
this amount is less than what is required by the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').
 
2.       
Subsection 54(1) says:
 
A landlord shall compensate a tenant who receives notice
of termination of a tenancy under section 50 for the
purpose of repairs or renovations in an amount equal to three months rent or
shall offer the tenant another rental unit acceptable to the tenant if,
 
(a)  
the tenant does not give the landlord notice under subsection 53 (2) with respect
to the rental unit;
 
(b)    
the residential complex in which the rental unit is located
contains at least five
residential units; and




File Number: CEL-03693-21
 
(c)    
the repair or renovation was not ordered
to be carried out under the
authority of this or any other Act [Emphasis added]
 
3.       
This section applies to matters in which the residential complex contains 5 or more units.
At the hearing, we asked the Landlord’s legal representative the number of
rental units were in the complex and she said five.
 
4.       
As the Landlord only paid to the
Tenant one month compensation instead of three months contrary to subsection
54(1), we find that the Landlord has failed to comply with the mandatory requirements of the Act and the Landlord’s application must be dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord's application is dismissed.
