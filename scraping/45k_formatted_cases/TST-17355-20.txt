Tharnea
Baskaran, Thiyagetheeswary Baskaran, Baskaran Padaiveerasingam and Prusoth
Baskaran (the 'Tenants') applied for an order determining that Toronto Commumity
Housing Corp (the 'Landlord')
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or
residential complex by the Tenants or by a member of their household.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on October 26, 2021.
 
The Tenants
(except for Tharnea
Baskaran) and the Landlord attended
the hearing. The Tenants were assisted by a
Tamil/English translator Prema Aiyar at the hearintg.
 
The application had been resolved
via mediation agreement entered into following a Case Management Hearing
on November 5, 2020.
 
The Tenants
filed a request
to reopen the application July 1, 2021.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord made a
preliminary request to dismiss the application as it had been resolved by
mediation in November 2020. I denied
the request as the issue at the hearing was to determine if there had been a breach of the mediated
agreement such that it could
be reopened.
 
2.    
The Tenants were not able to provide any evidence to establish that there had been a breach
of the agreement, and as such the request to reopen the mediation agreement must be refused.
