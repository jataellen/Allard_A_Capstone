Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-21271-19
 










 
 
 

Numbered
Company Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict VA (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes (L1 application).
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's
rent (L2 application). 
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on January 9, 2020.
 
The Landlord’s representative, DR, and the Tenant attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The Tenant
has been persistently late in paying the rent.
 
2.       The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period from April 1, 2019 to January 31, 2020.  Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
5, 2019.
 
3.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,500.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
4.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 1,
2018 to September 5, 2019.
 
5.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
L1 application
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before January 26, 2020.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,989.44*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to January 15, 2020, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $49.32 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting January 16, 2020 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
January 26, 2020, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from January 27, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before January 26, 2020, then starting January
27, 2020, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 27,
2020.
 
8.      If,
on or before January 26, 2020, the Tenant pays the amount of $8,450.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after January 27, 2020 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
L2
application
10.   If
the Tenant voids the eviction order pursuant to paragraph 8 or 9 of this order,
then for the 12-month period commencing on February 1, 2020, and ending on
January 1, 2021, the Tenant shall pay the rent on or before the due date: the
first day of each month.
 
11.   Section
78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 applies to paragraph 10 of
this order. If the Tenant fails to pay make any payment, the Landlord may,
without notice to the Tenant, apply to the Board for an order terminating the
tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord must make this application no
later than 30 days after the Tenant fails to make a payment.
