Review Order
 
A.C.L.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict M.S.
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes has
been persistently late in paying his rent. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination
date.
 
This
application was resolved by order TEL-76447-17 issued on February 13, 2017.
 
On
February 27, 2017, the Tenant requested a review of the order.
 
The
request for review was heard in Toronto on March 17, 2017.
 
The
Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing. The Landlord was represented by B.R..

 
Determinations:
 
1.      When
this application initially came before the Board the Tenant was not in
attendance and the matter was heard uncontested. The Landlord’s application for
non-payment of rent was declared to be discontinued as the Tenant had paid all
of the rent arrears and costs owing. With respect to the application alleging
the Tenant is persistently late paying the rent, the Board made a finding that
the Tenant had paid rent late each month for the period commencing March 1,
2016.
2.      The
Tenant’s request for review alleges: she was too ill to attend the original
hearing; the order contains a material error of fact in that she has not paid
the rent late each month since March, 2016; and the amount of daily
compensation ordered is incorrect as it uses an amount for the Tenant’s last
month’s rent deposit that she disagrees with. 
3.      When
the review came before the Board I canvassed the parties first with respect to
the latter of these three issues because it seemed to me that was a fairly
simple allegation of fact that the parties might agree on. I stood the matter
down so the Tenant could examine the Landlord’s ledger and after doing so she
essentially acknowledged that the third ground for review had no factual basis.

4.      With
respect to the second ground for the review I am satisfied that the order
contains a serious material error of fact and the review should be granted. It
is not true that the Tenant has failed to pay rent on time each month since
March 1, 2016.
5.      I
should note at this point that prior to hearing the evidence of the Tenant with
respect to the second ground for review, the Landlord’s representative asked
that his client be permitted to testify over the telephone due to illness. Such
requests are normally made in advance as the opposing party has the right to
object. So instead of permitting the Landlord’s witness to testify by phone I
offered an adjournment to the Landlord which was declined. The Landlord’s
representative indicated he wished to proceed without his witness.
6.      The
Tenant usually pays her rent by dropping a cheque into a drop box in the
residential complex on the first day of the month when it is due. Since the
residential complex was sold to the current Landlord about two years ago, there
is no full-time on site staff. Instead the Landlord sends someone to the
residential complex to pick up rent cheques. 
7.      The
Tenant says that for the months of March, 2016 through to August, 2016 she
dropped her cheque off as usual on the first of the month. But she acknowledges
that in September of 2016 she fell behind in the rent and did not catch up
until January 14, 2017.
8.      The
Landlord filed into evidence its ledger which does not accord with this
testimony of the Tenant. 
9.      I
should note at this point that with the review request the Tenant provided the
Board with a copy of two money orders she purchased on January 14, 2017. Those
two money orders paid off all of the arrears of rent as well as February’s rent
in advance. They are both dated January 14, 2017. The Tenant says she dropped
them into the Landlord’s drop box immediately after returning home the same day
she purchased them. I see no reason to disbelieve the Tenant in this regard.
But the Landlord’s ledger indicates these payments were received on January 19,
2017. I took this evidence to mean that the ledger reflects posting dates
instead of delivery dates. 
10.   It
may well be that the Landlord sends an employee to the residential complex on
the first day of each month to collect cheques from the drop box. This is a
standard practice in situations like this. But if the employee attends at 5
p.m. and the cheque is dropped off at 11 p.m. then the Landlord will not receive
that cheque on time through no fault of the Tenant. 
11.   In
other words, the totality of the evidence before the Board indicates that the
order that is the subject of this request for review contains a serious,
material error of fact. The Tenant did not pay rent late every month for the
period commencing March 1, 2016. Rather, she fell into arrears September 1,
2016, did not catch up until January 14, 2017, paid February’s rent in advance
and is now in arrears of rent for the month of March, 2017. 
12.   On
this basis the request for review is granted. As a result, the first ground in
the request for review is essentially moot. 
13.   After
granting the review request I proceeded to re-hear the entirety of the
application.
14.   There is
no dispute between the parties that in mid-January of 2017 the application for
non-payment of rent was discontinued pursuant to s. 74(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). This is because effective January 14,
2017, the Tenant had paid the Landlord all of the rent arrears owing and the
filing fee for this application. 
15.   There is
also no dispute that for the period commencing September 1, 2016 the Tenant was
late paying the rent 6 times out of 7 months. I say this because no rent was
paid in September, 2016, the Tenant continued to be in arrears until January
14, 2017, and March’s rent is currently outstanding. Based on this evidence I
am satisfied that for the period commencing September 1, 2016 the Tenant has
been persistently late paying the rent. 
16.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it would not be unfair to grant
relief from eviction subject to the conditions set out in this order pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. It is clear from the evidence
that the Tenant is able to pay rent on time, has a prior history of doing so,
and is committed to retaining her tenancy. The only reason March’s rent is
outstanding is because she thought she was being evicted and he deposit would
cover the rent. As long as rent is paid on time into the future, there is no
prejudice to the Landlord and this tenancy can and should continue.
17.   This
order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further
reasons shall be issued.
It is ordered that:
1.      Order TEL-76447-17
issued on February 13, 2017 is cancelled and replaced by the following: 
2.      The
Landlord’s application for non-payment of rent is discontinued.
3.      The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord the rent due for March, 2017 no later than March 24, 2017.
4.      The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord new rent as it comes due and owing on time and
in full for the period April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018.
5.      If the
Tenant fails to make any one of the payments in accordance with paragraphs 3
and 4 of this order the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to
the Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the
tenancy and evicting the Tenant.
