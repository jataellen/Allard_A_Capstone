Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-23434-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


LOWER, 219 ERIE AVENUE BRANTFORD ON N3S2H1


 




Between:


Noor Khan


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Nancy McCoughan
  Richard Moreau


Tenants



 
 
 
Noor Khan (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Nancy McCoughan and Richard Moreau
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard by videoconference on January 18, 2022. Only
the Landlord's Legal Representative, Jordan Nieuwhof, attended
the hearing. As
of 10:45 a.m., the Tenants
were not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from June 1, 2021 to July 31,
2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 26, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,550.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
6.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a
repayment agreement with the Tenants and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 4, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$11,808.43*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 24, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$49.32 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 25, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or
before February 4, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 5,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 4, 2022, then starting
February 5, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 5, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)          
$12,586.00 if the payment is made on or before
January 31, 2022,
or
ii)         
$14,136.00 if the payment is made on or before
February 4, 2022**.
If the
Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 5, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
