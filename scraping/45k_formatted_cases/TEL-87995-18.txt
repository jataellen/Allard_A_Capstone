C.K. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict P.M. and T.W. (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe. (L1 application)
 
C.K. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict P.M. and T.W. (the 'Tenants') because they have
been persistently late in paying their rent. (L2 application)
 
This application was heard in Toronto on June 12,
2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant, T.W.,
on behalf of both Tenants, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 application
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent they were required to pay for the period from June 1, 2017 to
June 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective December 18, 2017.
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,050.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2017 to December 18,
2017.
4.     
The Tenants have paid
$3,206.70 to the Board in trust since the application was filed. **.
5.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
L2
application
6.     
The Tenants have
persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due. The Landlord
provided evidence that during the relative short tenancy beginning in January
2017 the Tenants were late 10 times in the first 12 months. The Tenant does not
dispute this, although some of the late payments were only late by a day or
two.
7.     
The Tenant believes that on
a go forward basis she can arrange the payments that she and her partner
receive from social services and ODSP to ensure full payment to the Landlord on
the first of each month. The Tenant understands that any relief granted is her
last chance to keep her tenancy.
8.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
L1 application:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before June 26,
2018.The amount of $3,206.70 plus accrued interest shall be paid out to the
Landlord.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $1,553.54*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to June 15, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $34.52 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
June 16, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 26, 2018, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June
27, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 26, 2018, then starting June 27, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 27, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before June 26,
2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $2,383.90** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after June 27, 2018
but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
10.  
The Board shall pay to the
Landlord the amount of $3,206.70 together with any accrued interest. **
L2 application:
11.  
If the Tenants void the
eviction order for non-payment of rent pursuant to paragraph 8 or 9 above then
the Tenants shall pay to the Landlord new rent on time and in full for the
period commencing July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2019. 
12.  
If the Tenants fail to make
any one of the payments in accordance with paragraph 11 of this order the
Landlord may, without notice to the Tenants, apply to the Board pursuant to
section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenants and requiring that the Tenants pay any new arrears, NSF fees and
related charges that became owing after June 30, 2018.
