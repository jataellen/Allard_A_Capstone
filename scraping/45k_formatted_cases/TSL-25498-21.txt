Rpms Property
Management Services Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Barbara Dalgleish (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant failed
to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on July 27, 2021 with respect to
application TSL- 19408-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain
condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant
has not met the following condition specified in the order: The Tenant did not allow the Landlord
proper legal access to enter the rental unit with the proper written 24-hour notice
prior to entering.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 15, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 16, 2022.
