Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number: EAL-96643-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
A,
  733 FIRST STREET E CORNWALL ON K6H1M3


 




Between:


Elton Pang


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


John Poirier


Tenant



 
 
 
Elton Pang (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict John Poirier
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on November 2, 2021. Only the Landlord attended the hearing. As of 4:00 p.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from June 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective July 22, 2021.
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $800.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.    
The Tenant paid $30.00
after the application was filed.
 
6.    
I have considered
all of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.




File Number: EAL-96643-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 28, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$5,986.33*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 17, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $26.30
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 18, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 28, 2022, then starting
January 29, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 29, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before January 28, 2022, the Tenant pays the
amount of $6,486.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for
eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after January
29, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
