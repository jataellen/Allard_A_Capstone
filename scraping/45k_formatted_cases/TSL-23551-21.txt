In the
  matter of:


810, 11 BRUNEL COURT TORONTO ON M5V3Y3


 




Between:


Imtiaz
  Hashmani


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Ahmed Youssef Whitney Scheefer


Tenants



 
 
 
Imtiaz Hashmani (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Whitney Scheefer and
Ahmed Youssef (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe (L1); because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone
they permitted in the residential complex have wilfully
or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises.
The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenants to
compensate the Landlord for the damage; and because they have been persistently
late in paying their rent (L2).
 
This application was heard on February
15, 2022. Only The Landlord, represented by Bill Burd,
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the
period from March 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective June 9, 2021.
 
2.    
Based on the evidence submitted
and the testimony supporting the allegation the Tenants caused wilful or negligent damage
to the rental unit, I find the Tenants have wilfully or negligently caused undue
damage to the rental unit.
 
3.     The Landlord will incur costs
of $15,278.73 to repair the damage and replace property that was damaged and cannot be
reasonably repaired.
 
4.     The Tenants have also been persistently failed
to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
5.     The Tenants owe the Landlord
more than the Board’s monetary
jurisdiction of
$35,000.00. As such this order limits
the amount awarded
to $35,000.00.




File Number: TSL-23551-21
 
6.    
Based on the determinations of wilful or negligent damage
and persistently late payment
of rent, this order cannot be voided.
 
7.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 22, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$35,000.00.
 
3.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
27, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 28, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 22, 2022, then starting February
23, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
5.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is requested to expedite
the enforcement of this order and is directed to give vacant possession of the
unit to the Landlord, on or after February 23, 2022.

In accordance with section 81
