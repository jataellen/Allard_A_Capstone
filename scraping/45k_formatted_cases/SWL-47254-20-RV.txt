Review Order
 
Windsor Essex Community Housing
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Jos Raymond Leclerc (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did
not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved by order SWL-47254-20 issued on June 22, 2021. On October 25, 2021, the Tenant
requested a review of the order.
The request was heard by videoconference on January 14, 2022.
 
Only the Tenant and the Tenant’s
legal representative J. Timms Fryer attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Review
 
1.    
The Tenant’s request for a review
is based on the ground
of being not reasonably able to
participate in the proceedings.
 
2.     The hearing that gave rise to the order under
review took place on June 17, 2021. The
Tenant did not attend or send a representative.
 
3.     At the review hearing
the Tenant testified that he was in Nova Scotia from some time in April 2021 to October
2021 and that the did not receive
notice of the hearing as he does not know anyone in his vicinity who
he would trust with checking his mail. The Tenant also testified that he did
not receive any notice of arrears.




 
4.    
Based on the Tenant’s
uncontested evidence, I find, on a balance
of probabilities, that the
Tenant was not reasonably able to participate in the proceedings. At the hearing
I granted the review and the
Landlord’s L1 application proceeded de novo.
 
L1 application
 
5.    
Since the Landlord did not appear at the hearing to support the application,
I find that this application
has been abandoned.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Order SWL-47254-20 issued on June 22, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the
following:
 
2.     The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
