Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-78426-17
 










 
 
 

T.P.P.M.I.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict C.P.
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes
(the ‘L1 application’).
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the
Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with
the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord
or another tenant (the ‘L2 application’). The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination
date.
 
This
application was heard in Belleville on April 27, 2017.
 
The Landlord’s agent, S.C., and the Tenant attended the hearing. 
 
 
Determinations:
 
The L1 Application 
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from August 1, 2016 to April 30, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective February 14, 2017.
2.     
The arrears of rent owing for the period ending April 30, 2017,
total $5,404.24.
3.     
The Landlord incurred costs as a result of filing the application
in the amount of $170.00 and is entitled to reimbursement for those costs. 
4.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $906.78 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 1, 2014 to
February 14, 2017, in the amount of $41.22.
6.      The
Tenant disagrees with the amount of arrears claimed because he says the
Landlord hired him for several painting jobs and his monthly rent was to be
deducted accordingly. The Landlord provided the Board with a copy of the ledger
and a copy of all of the invoices for the Tenant’s painting work. These
documents indicate that the Landlord has not hired the Tenant for any painting
jobs since October 2016. The Tenant could not provide the Board with any
additional invoices or documentation to support his position that he was hired
for painting jobs after October 2016. 
7.      In
the absence of any supporting documentation, I am not satisfied that the Tenant
completed any painting jobs for the Landlord after October 2016. As a result, I
am satisfied that the outstanding arrears are as the Landlord claims. 
8.      The
Tenant is seeking relief from eviction in the form of a 2 week delay. The
Tenant says that he is expecting a cheque from his job in the amount of
$8,000.00 on May 27th and that money will more than pay all of the
outstanding arrears. 
9.      The
Tenant lives in the rental unit with his wife and his 19 year old son who is
attending college. The Tenant says that he fell into arrears due to two
workplace injuries and due to the sporadic nature of his employment. 
10.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until May 31, 2017, pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. If the Tenant does receive his expected
cheque on May 27th, it is unlikely that he will be able to pay the
outstanding arrears immediately because May 27th is a Saturday.
Delaying the eviction until May 31, 2017, should give the Tenant every
opportunity to pay the outstanding arrears if his cheque arrives. However,
should the cheque not arrive or contain insufficient funds to pay the arrears,
the Landlord will then have recourse in the form of an order for eviction. 
The
L2 Application 
11.   There
is no dispute between the parties that the Tenant has substantially interfered
with their lawful right, privilege or interest because he has failed to pay the
water bill for several months. The current outstanding balance for the water
bills is $1,427.51. 
12.   Based
on the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the Tenant’s conduct has
substantially interfered with the Landlord's lawful right, privilege or
interest. 
13.   Once
again, the Tenant is seeking relief from eviction in the form of a two week
delay. The total outstanding amount of arrears and water bills is $7,928.53 and
the Tenant says that the cheque for $8,000.00 he is expecting on May 27th
will pay for that entire amount. 
14.   For
the reasons already stated, I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until May 31, 2017, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.  
It
is ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before May 31, 2017.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $6,095.96*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to May 3, 2017, plus the outstanding water bills
charges, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $29.81 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting May 4, 2017 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May
14, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated
from May 15, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before May 31, 2017, then starting June 1, 2017,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 1, 2017.
8.      If,
on or before May 31, 2017, the Tenant pays the amount of $7,928.53** to the Landlord
or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the
unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after June 1, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
