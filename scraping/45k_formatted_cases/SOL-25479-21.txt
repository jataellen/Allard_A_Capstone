Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-25479-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


701, 180 STINSON STREET HAMILTON ON L8N1T1


 




Between:


The Effort
Trust Company


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Abby Pachai


Tenant



 
 
 
The Effort Trust Company
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Abby Pachai (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 1, 2022. Only
the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Kimberly Holleran, attended the hearing.
As of 2:57 p.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the
period from September 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination effective October 3, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord
incurred charges of $100.00 for cheques tendered
by or on behalf of the
Tenant, which were returned NSF.
 
3.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
4.     The lawful monthly
rent is $999.00.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $999.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 20, 2021 to October 3, 2021.
 
7.     The Tenant paid $999.00 after the application was filed.




 
8.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the parties and whether
the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 19, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $2,403.68*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to February 8, 2022 and the total charges related to NSF cheques tendered
to the Landlord by or on behalf
of the Tenant, less the rent deposit
and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord
$32.84 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 9, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does
not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
19, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 20, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 19, 2022, then starting February
20, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the
unit to the Landlord, on or after February 20, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before February 19,
2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $4,282.00** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain
in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.




 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 20, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
