Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-98713-18
 










 
 

M.F.I
(S.D), L (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict M.K and P.K (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on October 1, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative M.Z and the Tenants attended the
hearing.
Reasons:
Adjournment request
1.   
At the start of the hearing, the Tenants asked that the matter be
adjourned.  In making that request, they were represented by K.L, a lawyer. 
Mr. L advised that he had a limited retainer to represent the Tenants only in
requesting an adjournment.  
2.   
The Tenants sought the adjournment so that they could raise issues under
section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘RTA’).  Section
82 provides as follows:
82 (1) At
a hearing of an application by a landlord under section
69 for an order terminating a tenancy and evicting a tenant based on a
notice of termination under section
59, the Board shall permit the tenant to raise any issue that could be the
subject of an application made by the tenant under this Act.  
(2) If
a tenant raises an issue under subsection (1), the Board may make any order in
respect of the issue that it could have made had the tenant made an application
under this Act.
3.   
Mr. L explained that he had only recently been retained, and had not yet
had time to prepare the Tenants’ case respecting maintenance issues they wished
to raise under section 82.  He also argued that preparing this case will take
an unusually long time, because the Tenants intend to coordinate their claims
with those of other tenants in the complex, some of whom have special needs.
4.   
I denied the adjournment request.  Parties are generally expected to
come to their hearing prepared to proceed.  Section 82 gives the Tenants the
right to raise their own claims, but they were not prepared to exercise that
right.  Section 82 does not entitle them to delay the Landlord’s case in order
to bring their own case.
5.   
The Tenants are free to raise their claims by filing applications with
the Board.  Their claims will then be heard at a date when they are ready to
proceed.  There is no prejudice to them in dealing with the Landlord’s
application on the day that it was scheduled.  Rent arrears and maintenance are
not related issues, so there would be no efficiency gained by hearing the two
cases together.
6.   
If the Tenants’ case will take a particularly long time to prepare, that
is not a reason to adjourn the Landlord’s application.  On the contrary, it is
another reason to hear the Landlord’s application promptly, so that the arrears
issue can be resolved.  The Tenants will then have all the time they need to
prepare and file their own application respecting their maintenance issues.
7.   
After I denied the adjournment request, the Tenants received advice from
Duty Counsel respecting the arrears application, and were prepared to proceed
with that application.
Rent arrears
8.   
The Tenants owe the Landlord $1,016.30 in rent arrears.  They also owe
the Landlord its filing fee of $175.00 for this application.
9.   
The Tenants say that social assistance has sent the Landlord a payment
which should be received shortly.  That payment will be applied against the
amount owing once the Landlord receives it.  The Tenants are able to pay the
remaining balance within the standard eleven days, so relief from eviction
under section 83 of the RTA is not necessary.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before October 15, 2018.
2.      As
of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation
the Landlord is entitled to by $806.35*.
3.      However,
the Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the
Landlord owes the Tenants: $32.27 per day for compensation for the use of the
unit starting October 5, 2018 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit, and
$175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
4.      The
Landlord or the Tenants shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as
a result of this order.
5.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before October 15, 2018, then starting October
16, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
6.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after October 16,
2018.
7.      If,
on or before October 15, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $1,191.30** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
8.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after October 16, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
9.      Due
to a potential Canada Post strike, the Landlord, upon receipt of this order
must give a copy of this order to the Tenants by a method set out in subsection
191(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, other than by sending it
by mail or courier to the last known address where the Tenants reside or carry
on business.
