Joseph Deano


Tenant



 
 
Review Order
 
Equiton Residential Income Fund Lp. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict
Joseph Deano (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved by order EAL-96896-21 issued on October
29, 2021. On November 23,
2021, the Tenant requested a review of the order.
The request was heard by videoconference on February 7, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s legal representative D. Abraham, the Tenant, and the Tenant’s
legal representative S. Forsyth attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Review
 
1.     At the hearing
the Landlord’s legal
representative consented to the Tenant’s
request for a review. I therefore granted the request
for a review. The Landlord’s L1 application proceeded de novo.
 
L1 application
 
2.     The parties agree that the Tenant owes the Landlord
$4,419.39 (arrears to February 28, 2022 plus the cost of the
application, $201.00).
 
3.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’), including the impact of COVID-19 on the




 
parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find
that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the
conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of
the Act.
 
4.     The Tenant has a very limited income from social
assistance. The arrears accumulated because the Tenant had maintenance issues
and did not know how to approach them and he struggled to meet other financial
obligations. The Tenant has an infant child living with him as well as his
partner and a roommate. The Tenant lives with disabilities as do others who
live in the unit. The Tenant has arranged for a third party to pay more than
half the arrears by the end of this month and the Tenant is prepared to pay
down the rest in little more than a year. I have also considered that this is a short tenancy. On balance it is not unfair to grant relief from
eviction in these circumstances.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
5.     The Tenant’s request
for a review of order EAL-96896-21 is granted.
 
6.     Order EAL-96896-21 issued
on October 29, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the
following:
 
7.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4,419.39, which
represents the amount
of rent owing up to February
28, 2022 and the application fee.
 
8.    
The Tenant shall pay the amount owing and rent that comes
due as follows:
 
a)    
On or before February
28, 2022 the Tenant shall pay $2,500.00
to the Landlord;
 
b)    
On or before March 1, 2022 and
continuing until February 28, 2023, the Tenant
shall pay $150.00
to the Landlord on or before the first day of each month;
 
c)     
On or before March 1, 2023,
the Tenant shall pay $119.39.00 to the Landlord; and
 
d)    
Commencing March 1, 2022 and
continuing until the full amount owing is paid
off, the Tenant shall pay the
monthly rent in full on or before the first day
of each month.
 
9.     If the Tenant fails to make any one of the payments in
accordance with this order, the outstanding balance of any arrears of rent
and costs to be paid by the Tenant to the Landlord pursuant to paragraph 7
of this order shall become immediately due and owing and the Landlord may,
without notice to the Tenant, apply to the Board pursuant to section 78 of the
Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant and requiring
that the Tenant pay any new arrears, NSF fees and related charges that became owing
after February 28, 2022. The Landlord must make this application no later
than 30 days after the Tenant’s failure to make a payment.
