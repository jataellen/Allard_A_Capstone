Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57077-21
 



In the matter
of:


2, 425 ELIZABETH STREET LONDON ON N5W3R8


 




Between:


2475293 Ontario Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Rob Munroe


Tenant



 
 
 
2475293 Ontario Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Rob Munroe (the 'Tenant') and for an order
to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant
owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on March 4, 2021 with respect to application
SWL-45111-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant has not met the following condition specified in the order: The Tenant failed to pay the lawful
monthly rent in full on or before November 1, 2021.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $3,086.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application
fee in Order SWL-45111-20. The amount that is still owing from that order is $686.00
and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous
order SWL-45111-20 is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed
to pay the full rent that became owing for the
period from November 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.
 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $800.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.




 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit has been paid to the Tenant
up to December 31, 2020.
There is no further interest owing since there was no guideline rent
increase allowed (consequently no interest) in 2021 due to COVID19.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.   
Order SWL-45111-20 is cancelled.
 
2.   
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 16, 2022.
 
3.    The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$788.34*. This amount represents the
rent owing up to January 5, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$26.30 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 6, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.   
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
16, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at .200% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.   
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January
17, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord on or after January 17, 2022.

The tenant has until January 15, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 15, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.




 
In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on July 17, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction
where the rental unit is located.
