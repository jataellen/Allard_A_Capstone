In the matter
of:


MAIN FLOOR,

Between:


Dominique Roberts
  Jason Roberts


Landlords




 


and


 




 


Rj Manzutti


Tenant



 
 
On February 4, 2022, Dominique
Roberts and Jason Roberts (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Rj Manzutti (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the
Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued
by the Board on January 5, 2022 with respect to application TEL-09411-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that the
Landlords could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant
has not met the following
condition(s) specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed
to pay to the Landlord the lawful rent on or before February
1, 2022.
 
3.    
The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,370.40 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
4.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from August 1, 2014 to February 24, 2022.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     Order TEL-09411-20 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before March 7, 2022.

date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Landlords or the Tenant shall pay any amounts that become owing as a result of this
order.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 7, 2022, then starting
March 8, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.

the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit
