Amended Order
Order under
Subsection 87(1)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
And Section
22.1 of the Statutory Powers
and Procedures Act
File Number: HOL-09659-21-AO
 



In the matter
of:


LOWER, 11 GARRARDVIEW STREET AJAX ON L1Z0N5


 




Between:


Sushma Manda Venkateshwar Rao Manda


Landlords




 


and


 




 


Vishal Singh Rampaderat


Tenant



 
Sushma Manda
and Venkateshwar Rao Manda (the 'Landlords')
applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Vishal
Singh Rampaderat (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes.
This application was heard via video/teleconference on September 10, 2021.
The Landlords, the Landlord's Legal Representative Jane Ferguson
and the Tenant attended the hearing.
The Tenant
spoke with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
An
order was issued
on September 17, 2021 which contained a clerical error relating to the
total amount of arrears of rent owing as of the period ending September 30,
2021. This amended order corrects those clerical errors. All other aspects of the order remain the same.
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord served
a Notice of Termination because
the Tenant had not
paid the total rent that was required to be paid from May 1, 2021 to
September 30, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant was in possession of the rental
unit on the date the application was filed by the Landlord with the Board.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,350.00.
 
4.    
The Landlords collected a rent
deposit of $1,350.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being
held by the Landlords.
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from November 5, 2019.
 
5.     The Tenant paid $350.00 after
the application was filed.




 
 
 
6.    
The Landlord submitted a L1 information update form setting
out that the total amount
of the rent arrears now owing to the Landlord
up to September 30, 2021 totals $11,800.00.
 
7.    
The Tenant did not dispute the amount of rent arrears owing to the Landlord.
 
8.     Based on the Landlord’s uncontested claim for arrears
of rent, I am satisfied
on a balance of probabilities that as of the hearing date, the
Tenant owes to the Landlord up to the period ending September 30, 2021, rent
arrears of $11,800.00, plus $186.00 for the Landlord’s cost to file the application -
totalling $11,986.00.
 
9.    
The Landlord's Representative
testified that the Landlord reached
out to the Tenant via email on a number of
occasions seeking a negotiated
repayment plan with the Tenant:
Landlord email to the Tenant – August 4, 2021
In recognition of the potential
financial hardship suffered by many tenants as a consequence of the COVID-19
pandemic, we invite
you to propose a payment
plan with respect to your
arrears of rent and costs owed…..
Tenant email response to Landlord – August 4, 2021
I will address my concerns
at the hearing.
 
10.  I find the Tenant made no genuine good faith effort in
negotiating a repayment plan or any form of a final settlement
as was encouraged by the Landlord prior to the hearing. As a result, I am satisfied that the
Landlord complied with their obligations under subsection 83(6) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).
 
11.  The Tenant cited apart from the impact of COVID, he
had other financial obligations relating to ongoing
marital differences. Only now the Tenant was proposing an arrears
repayment plan.
 
12.  The Landlord is requesting a standard order
for the arrears
owing and to end the tenancy.
 
13.  After having considered the submissions made and all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance
with subsection 83(2)
of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
I find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the
Act. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before September 30,
2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant
voided the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated
effective September 30, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $9,782.90*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to September
17, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $44.38
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting September 18,
2021 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.




 
 
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing* on or before September 28, 2021, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from September 29,
2021 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
September 30, 2021,
then starting October
1, 2021, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after October 1, 2021.
 
8.    
If, on or before September 30,
2021, the Tenant pays the amount of $11,986.00** to the Landlords or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would
not be terminated and the Tenant could
remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time,
the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after
October 1, 2021 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlords. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
