  Steve Lazary


Tenants



 
 
Sherry-Lynne McQuillan (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Steve Lazary
and Christina Lazary
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 27, 2022. Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
As of 2:26 p.m., the Tenants were not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from April 7, 2021 to August 6,
2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 30, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on August 15, 2021.
The Tenants were in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,800.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of August 15, 2021, the date the Tenants
gave vacant possession of the
rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlord $7,732.62*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to August 15, 2021.




File Number: NOL-43863-21
 
 
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
15, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 16, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
