Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-11177-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


685 JEROME JODOIN
ORLEANS DRIVE OTTAWA ON
  K4A1G8


 




Between:


Nyasha Kamera


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Masih Rostaee
Victoria Andrew-Rostaee


Tenants



 
 
 
Nyasha Kamera
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Victoria Andrew-Rostaee and Masih Rostaee (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 3, 2022.
 
The Landlord,
Nyasha Kamera, and the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Daniel Abiodun,
attended the hearing. As of 9:16
a.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board. The Tenant, Victoria Andrew-Rostaee,
called in via telephone at 9:45 a.m. The
Member advised the Tenant that the Notice of Hearing served upon her on January
6, 2022, indicated that she must sign into the
video conference at 8:45 a.m. and that matter had been called at 9:16
a.m. No response from the Tenant was received and the matter
proceeded as uncontested. The Tenant
advised the Member that she had to take her child to school and was not able to
sign nor did she make arrangements for someone to attend in her absence. The Tenant was advised that the matter had
been disposed of.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from January 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
June 30, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants were in possession of the rental
unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.    
The lawful monthly rent is $2,500.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.




File Number: HOL-11177-21
 
5.    
The Tenants have made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
6.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 1, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $33,050.27*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February 18,
2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $82.19 per
day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 19, 2022 to the
date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before March 1, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from March 2,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before March 1, 2022,
then starting March 2, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction
may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the
unit to the Landlord, on or after March 2, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenants
wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants
must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$34,086.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022,
or
ii)             
$36,586.00 if the payment
is made on or before
March 1, 2022**.
If the Tenants
do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after March 2, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
