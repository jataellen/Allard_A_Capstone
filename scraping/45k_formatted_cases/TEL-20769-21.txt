Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-20769-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


BASEMENT, 35 JOHN
STONER DRIVE SCARBOROUGH ON
  M1B3A2


 




Between:


Sherwin S. Modeste


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Emmanuel
Awodipe Obi


Tenant



 
 
 
Sherwin S.
Modeste (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Emmanuel Awodipe Obi (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes. The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
the Tenant because the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for the
purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 21, 2021.
 
Only the
Landlord attended the hearing. As of 2:06 p.m., the Tenant was not present or
represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
Landlord’s L1
Application
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective September
30, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant
is in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is
$1,050.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant has not made any payments since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,050.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
The rent arrears outstanding to December 31, 2021 total
$6,300.00.




 
 
 
7.    
The Landlord
incurred costs of $201.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
 
Landlord’s L2
Application
 
8.    
On September 10, 2021,
the Landlord served the Tenant with an N12 Notice of Termination (N12) with a
termination date of February 28, 2022. The N12 seeks termination of the tenancy
on the ground that the Landlord requires
the rental unit for
residential occupation.
 
9.    
The Landlord
is not charging the Tenant
any rent for the month
of January 2022 as the required compensation which is part of
this application.
 
10.  In this matter, the Landlords’ N12 was
served to the Tenant as the Landlord’s daughter intends to occupy the rental
unit for at least one year. The Landlord’s daughter, Courtenay Modeste,
submitted her Affidavit
stating her intent to move into the rental unit with the Landlords’ application.
 
Good Faith
 
11.  The N12 was served pursuant to section 48 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act).
Section 48(1) requires that, in order to be successful in this application, the
Landlord must establish that at the time of the service of the N12 he required, in good faith,
the unit for residential use.
 
12.  In Feeney v. Noble, 1994 CanLII
10538 (ON SC), the Court held that the test of good faith is genuine intention
to occupy the premises and not the reasonableness of the Landlord’s proposal.
This principle was upheld in Salter v. Beljinac 2001 CanLII 40231 (ON
SCDC), where the Court held that the “good faith” requirement simply means that
the Landlord sincerely intends to occupy the rental unit. The Landlord may also
have additional motives for selecting a particular rental
unit, but this does not affect the good
faith of the Landlord’s notice.
 
13.  In the more recent case of Fava v.
Harrison, [2014] O.J No. 2678 ONSC 3352 (Ont.Div.Ct.) the Court determined that while the motives of the
Landlord are, per Salter, “largely
irrelevant”, the Board can consider the conduct and motives of the Landlord to
draw inferences as to whether
the Landlord desires,
in good faith to occupy
the property.
 
14.  In this matter, I am satisfied, based on
the Landlord’s evidence, that his daughter genuinely intends to live in the
rental unit for at least one year. I
find that the Landlord in good faith requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation for a family member for a
period of at least one year.
 
Relief From Eviction
 
15.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to




 
postpone the eviction until February 28, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b)
of the Act. This will allow the Tenant the time to find another place
to live.
 
16.  This order contains
all of the reasons in this matter
and no further reasons will be
issued.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 28, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant will not pay the rent due for January 2022. This is the required
compensation paid to the Tenant as part of the Landlord’s L2
application.
 
3.    
The Tenant’s
last month's rent deposit will be applied
to the rent for February 2022.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $6,300.00, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to December 31, 2021.
 
5.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00 for the cost of filing
the L1 application.
 
6.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 28, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March
1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
7.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
