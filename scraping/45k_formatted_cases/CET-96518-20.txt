In the matter of:


884 KHAN CRESCENT MISSISSAUGA ON L5V2R4


 




Between:


Haroon Wahid
  Taha Haroon


Tenants




 


 
and


 




 


Jamil Khan


Landlord



 
 
Haroon Wahid and Taha Haroon (the 'Tenants') applied
for an order determining that Jamil Khan (the 'Landlord') harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened
or interfered with them, entered the rental unit illegally and substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or
residential complex by the Tenants or by a member of their household.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on December 2, 2021 at 2:00 P.M.
 
The Tenants and the Landlord, the Landlord's Legal
Representative, Mr. Sam Ursino,
attended the hearing.
 
The Tenant spoke with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants moved into the rental unit
on May 5, 2017 and moved
out of the rental unit on October
17, 2019, which was uncontested by the Landlord. The monthly rent was
$800.00.
 
2.    
The application was filed with the Board on October 16,
2020.
 
3.    
The Tenants’ application includes
the following allegations:
 
•        
The Landlord illegally imposed
2 verbal rent increases in August 2019 and then in
October 2019.
•        
The Landlord illegally entered
the rental unit after October 17, 2019.
•        
The Landlord gave a bad faith notice
of termination of the tenancy in 2019.
 
4.    
The Tenants’ application alleges
that the Landlord verbally imposed an illegal rent increase of $100.00 in August 2019 and an additional $200.00
monthly increase effective
October 17, 2019. I find that this claim must be made using a T1 application
filed under




File Number: CET-96518-20
 
section 135 of the Act and is not properly included
in a T2 application concerning Tenants’ Rights.
 
5.    
The Tenants’ application also
alleges a bad faith termination by the Landlord, who told him verbally, he intended to have his daughter move into the rental unit at some point in
August/September 2019. No exact dates were submitted as evidence related to
this allegation. The Tenant also asserted the move-in did not happen. I find
that this claim must be made using a T5 Application – Landlord Gave a Notice of
Termination in Bad Faith filed under section 57 of the Act and is not properly
included in a T2 application concerning Tenants Rights. I find the application
is dismissed.
 
6.    
The application alleges illegal
entry by the Landlord
on October 22, 2019, which
was after the Tenants
confirmed moved out date of October 17, 2019. As it was uncontested that the
Tenant was not in possession of the rental unit at the time of the alleged
entry, I find that it cannot constitute an illegal entry.
 
7.    
The application also alleges the
Landlord illegally entered the unit on other previous occasions, but no
specific dates of the alleged entries were provided. Without more details related
to specific dates or times, I find that it would be unfair to the Landlord
to proceed with this claim.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenants' application is
dismissed.
