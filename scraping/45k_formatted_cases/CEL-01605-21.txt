In the matter
of:


3, 19 MAIN STREET PENETANGUISHENE ON L9M1S6


 




Between:


Sara Gardner
  Eric Chicoine


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Kellie Hastings Richard Hastings


Tenants



 
 
 
Sara Gardner and Eric Chicoine
(the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Kellie Hastings and Richard Hastings
(the 'Tenants') because they,
another occupant of the rental unit or a person the
Tenants permitted in the residential complex have seriously impaired the safety
of any person. The Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by video/teleconference on January 6, 2022.
 
The Landlord, Sara Gardner,
the Tenant, Richard
Hastings (RH), the Tenants’ legal representative, Daniel English,
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
This application is based on a
notice of termination served on the Tenant pursuant to section 66 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). That section permits a landlord to give a
tenant a notice of termination if an act or omission of the tenant seriously
impairs the safety of another person, provided that the act or omission
complained of occurs in the residential complex
(Form N7). This means that the Landlord must establish that the effect or potential effect of
the Tenant’s actions threatens the well being or physical integrity of another
person to such a degree that termination of the tenancy is reasonable in order
to ensure the safety of others. In other words, have the
Tenant’s actions put someone
at serious risk of physical
harm?
 
2.     The allegations set out on the Notice of Termination
consisted of the Tenant RH using threatening
language towards another
tenant on July 19, 2021 and exhibiting threatening behaviour and abusive language in June and July
2021; and in 2020 and 2021 verbally abusing other occupants of the residential
complex.




File Number: CEL-01605-21
 
3.    
As noted at the hearing, the
incident on July 19, 2021 does not on its face amount to serious impairment of
safety. It may well be that the
Tenant’s actions substantially interfered with the Landlord’s and the other
tenants’ reasonable enjoyment of the premises or interferes with another lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord, as contemplated by section 64 of the Act. But this is an application based on a notice served pursuant to section 66 of the Act.
 
4.    
With respect to the other allegations set out on
the Notice of Termination, the Notice of Termination Form N7 served upon the Tenants
does not include
dates and times
of the alleged threatening
conduct.
 
5.     The Ontario Divisional Court in Ball v. Metro
Capital Property and Lockhurst (December 19, 2002), Toronto Docket
No. 8/02, found
that subsection 43(2)
of the Act requires that a
notice served upon a tenant must include dates and times of the alleged
offensive conduct with a detailed description of the alleged conduct engaged in
by the tenant.
 
6.     Therefore, the Form N7 served upon the Tenants is
defective, and the Board cannot consider the Landlord’s application to terminate the tenancy on the basis
that the Tenant RH has seriously impaired the
safety of another person, and this event occurred in the residential complex.
 
7.     As a result,
the Landlord’s application shall be dismissed.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
