Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-04499-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


UPPER UNIT, 34 QUEEN STREET BARRIE ON L4M1Z1


 




Between:


Nickolas Leonienco


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Stephanie Crone


Tenant



 
 
 
Nickolas Leonienco (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Stephanie Crone
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant entered
into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord and the Tenant signed an agreement to terminate
the tenancy as of March 1, 2022.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before March 1, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 1, 2022, then starting March 2, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 2, 2022.

81 of the Act, the part of this order
