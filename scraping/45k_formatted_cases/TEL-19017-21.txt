Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19017-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


97
DOBSON DRIVE AJAX ON L1S5G1


 




Between:


Ashton Paul


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Tamara Bell


Tenant



 
 
 
Ashton Paul (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tamara
Bell (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes (L1 application).
 
Ashton Paul (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tamara Bell (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently
caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage; because the
Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in
the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege
or interest of the Landlord
or another tenant;
and because the Landlord requires possession of the
rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the
termination date (L2 application).
 
 
This application was heard by video conference
on December 14, 2021.
 
At 2:28 pm, the Landlord and the
Landlord’s Agent Valerie
Bason attended the hearing.
 
On the date of the hearing, the
Landlord advised that the Tenant
vacated the rental unit on May 2,
2021 and vacant possession has been returned
to the Landlord. The Landlord
requested that the L1 application be converted to a L9 application for arrears only, not eviction.
The application is amended
accordingly and I proceeded to hear the L9 application.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
As the Tenant vacated
the rental unit on May 2, 2021, the Landlord’s L2 application to terminate the tenancy is moot.




 
2.     The Landlord is seeking daily
compensation from the Tenant
for May 1 and May 2,
2021.
 
3.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period
from February 1, 2021 to
December 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective April 30, 2021.
 
4.     The Landlord applied
the rent deposit
of $2,000.00 for April 2021 rent.
 
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 20, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$20,657.77*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 9, 2022, less any monies already paid to
the Landlord.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$65.75 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 10, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
20, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 21, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 20, 2022, then starting
February 21, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 21, 2022.
 
7.     If, on or before February 20, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $26,000.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain
in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 21, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
