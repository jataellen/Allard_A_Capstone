Order under Section
77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-04390-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


218, 1291 GORDON
STREET SOUTH GUELPH ON
  N1L0M5


 




Between:


Sussan Azimi


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Rahman
Ayoola Bello


Tenant



 
 
 
Sussan Azimi (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Rahman Ayoola Bello (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant entered into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord filed a
declaration in support of this application, stating that the Tenant
acknowledged vacating the unit but refused to sign the agreement to terminate the tenancy.
The N11 was attached to the application, showing that the Tenant did not in fact
sign the agreement. Section 53.4 of O. Reg 516/06
under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’) states that if an application is made with respect to an agreement to
terminate the tenancy, the application must be accompanied by a copy of the agreement. The Landlord has
not attached a copy of the agreement, as the N11 does not show that the parties
agreed to terminate the tenancy.
As such, I find that the Landlord’s application is dismissed on this basis.
 
2.    
The Landlord
raised issues regarding the Tenant’s conduct
in the declaration. The Landlord may wish to contact the Landlord
Self-Help Centre at 1-800-730-3218 to get legal advice with respect
to filing an application regarding
the Tenant’s conduct.
The Landlord Self-Help Centre is funded by Legal Aid
Ontario and is not affiliated with the Landlord and Tenant Board.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord's application is dismissed.
