In the matter
of:


210, 290 MORNINGSIDE AVENUE TORONTO ON M1E3E9


 




Between:


Edelstein Apartments Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Mitre Mitrevski And
Occupants


Tenants



 
 
 
Edelstein Apartments Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict Current Occupant(s) and Mitre
Mitrevski (the 'Tenants') because they, another occupant of the rental unit or
someone they permitted in the residential complex have wilfully or negligently
caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the damage; because they,
another occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant; and because
they, another occupant of the rental unit or a person the Tenants permitted in
the residential complex have seriously impaired the safety of any person. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the
unit after the termination date.
 
This application
was heard by video/teleconference on February 8, 2022. Only the Landlord’s legal representative, Sam Ursino, attended
the hearing. Determinations:
1.    
The Tenants used a power tool in the rental unit to cut furniture and caused a fire in the
rental unit.
 
2.     The Landlord provided
photographic evidence of the damage caused to the rental unit,
and an estimate of the cost to repair the rental unit in the amount of
$64,109.88.
 
3.     The Landlord served
the Tenants two Notice of Termination based
on the undue damage caused
to the rental unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants vacated the rental unit on November
30, 2021. As such, the tenancy is terminated effective November 30,
2021.

5.     The Landlord is seeking $5,000.00
for the reasonable costs of repairing the damage
and replacing the damaged property. This amount represents the insurance
deductible.
 
6.     Based on the uncontested evidence before me, I am
satisfied that the Tenants caused undue damage to the rental unit and the Landlord
incurred costs to repair the damage. As such, the Landlord is entitled to the
$5,000.00 insurance deductible.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated, as of
November 30, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $5,000.00, which
represents the insurance deductible for the reasonable costs
of repairing the damage
and replacing the damaged property.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February 27, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 28, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
