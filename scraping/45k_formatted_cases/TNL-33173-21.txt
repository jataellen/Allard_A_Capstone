Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-33173-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


UPPER LEVEL, 309 LAKEVIEW BOULEVARD GEORGINA ON L4P2Y6


 




Between:


Shameran Shamoon Sakeena Ghulam Nabi
  Marziye Gholami


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Geoffrey Prior
  Wendy Page


Tenants



 
 
 
Shameran Shamoon (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Wendy Page and Geoffrey Prior (the 'Tenants') because:
(a)    
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe (the “L1 Application”).
(b)  
the Tenants, another occupant of
the rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have
wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the damage; and because
they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the
residential complex have substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
or lawful right,
privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another
tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after the termination date (the “L2 Application”)
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on October
1, 2021, December
17, 2021 and February 4,
2022.
 
At the hearing of October 1,
2021, the (applicant) Landlord’s agent, George Warda, the (applicant)
Landlord’s representative, Howard Levenson, and the Tenants, Geoffrey Prior and
Wendy Page, attended the hearing.
Melina Mora provided
testimony for the (applicant) Landlord.
 
At the hearing of December 17,
2021, the (applicant) Landlord’s representative, Howard Levenson, the (successor) Landlords’ representative, Sajjad Najem, and the Tenants, Geoffrey Prior and Wendy Page, attended
the hearing.
 
At the hearing of February 4, 2022,
the (applicant) Landlord’s representative, Howard Levenson, the (successor) Landlords’
representative, the (successor) Landlords’ agent, Abdullah Hamid, and the
Tenants, Geoffrey Prior and Wendy Page, attended the hearing. The Tenants were assisted by Tenant Duty
Counsel at this hearing.




 
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord did not advance
its L2 Application.
 
2.     For reasons outlined in Interim Order TNL-32960-21-IN
and TNL-33173-21IN dated October 18, 2021, eviction cannot be granted pursuant
to the L1 Application, and accordingly the only remedy I have considered is the Landlord’s claim for rent arrears pursuant to section 87 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act).
 
3.     The applicant Landlord,
Shameran Shamoon, sold the residential complex to Sakeena Ghulam Nabi and Marziye Gholami, with a closing date on or about October 31, 2021. The applicant Landlord, Shameran Shamoon, served and filed
an amendment to the application adding, Sakeena Ghulam Nabi and Marziye
Gholami, as parties to this application as Landlords. The amendment was accepted at the hearing.
 
4.    
Rent owing for the rental periods
commencing November 1, 2021 to date, being the period in which Sakeena Ghulam
Nabi and Marziye Gholami have been owners of the residential complex, have been
separately addressed in a consent order in application TNL-32960-21. Accordingly, this order applies
only addresses the rent arrears
owing by the Tenant for the
period up to October 31, 2021.
 
5.     The Tenant owe $14,425.00 in arrears of rent for the period from September 1, 2020 to October 31, 2021.
 
6.    
The Tenant
was in possession of the rental unit on
April 17, 2021, the date the
application was filed.
7.    
The lawful monthly rent is $1,500.00.
 
8.    
The Tenant has
made $6,300.00 payments since the application was filed, which includes the waiver of rent due July 1, 2021 as statutory compensation for the N12 notice
of termination that forms the basis of application TNL-32960-21.
9.    
As noted above, the applicant
Landlord, Shameran Shamoon, sold the residential complex to Sakeena Ghulam Nabi
and Marziye Gholami, with a closing date of October 31, 2021. I must therefore
consider whether the applicant Landlord is entitled to proceed with this
application. Section 18 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, (the
“Act”) provides that “Covenants concerning things related to a rental unit or
the residential complex in which
it is located run with the land,
whether or not the things
are in existence at the time the covenants are made.” The payment of rent, including arrears, is
a covenant of a lease, and accordingly the right to rent is a right that runs
with the land. Upon a change of ownership, these covenants and rights
automatically pass to a new owner. In effect,
the right to receive arrears
therefore becomes a right of a new landlord.
 
10.  The application before me was properly brought by
applicant Landlord, Shameran Shamoon when still the owner
of the property and a landlord
within the meaning
of the




 
Act, and therefore a proper applicant
for an application for arrears
under section 87 of the
Act.
 
11.  The successor Landlords, Sakeena Ghulam Nabi and
Marziye Gholami, through their representative,
indicated that they waive their interest in the pre-closing arrears in favour of the applicant Landlord,
Shameran Shamoon, to whom the benefit of the arrears order should be directed. As no authority has been presented to me that indicates that such a direction is improper, I find that in these circumstances I can issue an order requiring the Tenant to pay rent arrears to the
applicant Landlord for the time period up to the date of the sale of the rental
unit.
 
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Sakeena Ghulam Nabi and Marziye Gholami
are added to the application as Landlords
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord, Shameran
Shamoon, $14,425.00, which represents the amount of rent owing
up to October 31, 2021.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord, Shameran
Shamoon, $201.00 for the cost of
filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do not pay the
Landlord, Shameran Shamoon, the full amount owing on or before February 25,
2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest calculated from February 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually
on the balance outstanding.
