Ethan Mcgill


Tenant



 
 
 
Carolyn Forsyth (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ethan Mcgill (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently
caused undue damage to the premises.
The Landlord has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage;
The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate
the Landlord for the damage; because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord in a residential complex that has three
or fewer residential units; and because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or a person the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex has seriously impaired the safety of any person.
The Landlord also applied because
the applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653#
on January 12, 2022.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s Representative, Keith Shaw and the Tenant attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant lives in unit #2 not unit #3 (which doesn’t
exist). The address
in the style of cause of
this order has been amended accordingly.
 
2.     The Tenant found a copy of the Notice of Hearing that the Landlord
discarded with his name on it. The Board mailed the
Notice of Hearing to the unit #3 which is the same address on the L1 and L2
applications which is incorrect.
 
3.     The Tenant stated he did not receive the Notices of
Termination and did not know the case required to be met. The Certificate of
Service indicates the Landlord’s Representative, Keith Shaw couriered the N4, N5 and N7 Notices to unit #3 which is not

the same address as the rental
unit. On that basis, I do not find the Tenant received adequate Notice to know the case
required to be met.
 
4.     The Board has no jurisdiction to terminate the tenancy
without a valid N4, N5 and N7 notice to support
the L1 and L2 application. The wrong address
on the Notices renders them
void because they don’t comply with section
43 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').
 
5.     The Landlord mailed the L1/L9 Update Sheet to the
correct address and therefore the Tenant on a balance of probabilities, ought
to have known the amount of rent the Landlord was claiming. I considered
converting the L1 application for eviction
and arrears to an L9 application for arrears only but the information on the L1
application caused confusion and contained serious
errors with the calculations of arrears because
it was missing rent charges
for June, July and August 2021 and also included unpaid utility costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s L1 and L2 application is dismissed.
