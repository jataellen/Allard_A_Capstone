Tenant



 
 
Russ Gallant and Mathieu
Cormier (the 'Landlords') applied for in this A1 Application for an order
to determine whether the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') applies.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on August
11, 2021.
 
Russ Gallant attended the hearing
on behalf of both Landlords. As of 10:06 a.m., the Tenant failed
to appear for the hearing.
 
The matter proceeded by way on an uncontested hearing pursuant to section 7 of
Statutory Powers of Procedure Act.
 
 
Determinations and Reasons:
 
 
1.    
The Landlords made an A1
application. An A1 application under
section 9 of the “Act” is to determine
whether the “Act” applies.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s submissions and
evidence revealed they were trying to a seek determination from the Board that
the Innkeepers Act applies to this particular unit. The Reason below the
application is dismissed as the Board does not any determination if the Innkeepers Act applies.
 
3.    The Board does not have jurisdiction to make determination about whether the Innkeepers Act
applies or not.
 
4.    The Landlord attempted
to submit various
evidence to support
their position that there was an
Inn, not a Residential Tenancies. Some examples of there evidence were:
•        
Reservation Contract;
•        
Housekeeping services
provided;
•        
Sale Representative and reservation number; and




 
•        
Reservation provided for 30,60,90, up to 180 days and at times
extended up to 1 year.
 
5.   
I
did not consider
the evidence as the Board
does not have the jurisdiction to determine that this unit was an Inn. Therefore, the
Landlord’s application is dismissed.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
