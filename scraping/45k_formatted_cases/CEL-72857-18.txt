Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006











 

PL and RL or collectively, the Landlords applied for
an order to terminate the tenancy and evict YL or the Tenant because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. (L1 Application)
 
The Landlords also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlords or another tenant (N5 Notice); and
because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent (N8
Notice).  (L2 Application) 
 
These applications were heard in Mississauga on
February 8, 2018.
 
The Landlords and the Tenant
attended the hearing.  JE appeared as a witness for the Tenant.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 Application
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from January 1, 2018
to February 28, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of
Termination effective January 16, 2018.
2.     
The Landlords collected a
rent deposit of $975.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by
the Landlords.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 5, 2016 to January 16, 2018.
4.     
The Tenant made no rent
payments after the application was filed.  The Landlords submitted exhibits
LL#1 and LL#2 to support their testimony that the e-fund-transfer password
provided by the Tenant in January 2018 was incorrect.  The Tenant affirmed the
password is indeed correct and submitted exhibits TT#1 and TT#2, which support
her testimony that she provided the Landlords with 6 postdated cheques for rent
due between January and July 2018 inclusively.  The Landlords denied ever
receiving those cheques.
5.     
Otherwise, there was no
dispute of the amount of rent owing by the Tenant to date.
6.     
The Tenant requested that
the payment of the application filing fee be made according to a payment plan,
which the Landlords agreed to, but reluctantly.  
7.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
L2 Application
N8 Notice to End Tenancy
8.     
Based on the submissions of
the parties, I find the Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the
date it was due.
9.     
The Tenant requested relief
from eviction by requiring the Tenant to pay here lawful rent for the next
twelve months on or before the 1st day of every month, starting in March 2018. 

10.  
The Landlords agreed to this
on the condition that should the Tenant fail to make any one of said rent
payments in full and on time, the Landlords would have the right to seek the
Tenant’s eviction, without notice to the Tenant, under section 78 of the Act. 
The Tenant understood and agreed to this condition, and so this is what will be
ordered.  
N5 Notice to End Tenancy
11.  
There are two N5 notices of
termination underlying the L2 application.  The first N5 was served on the
Tenant on November 30, 2017, and identified the Landlord’s complaint that the
Tenant called the Landlords about an air conditioning issue when the Landlords
stated there was no such issue.  The second N5 was served on the Tenant on
January 11, 2018, this time detailing the Landlord’s complaint of another false
issue reported by the Tenant concerning a leak in the basement, and further
notified the Tenant about the Tenant’s removal of a door, the CO detector and
clutter around the furnace area.
12.  
The Landlords testified that
they believed the first N5 was corrected by the Tenant and therefore voided in
the seven-day period.  Reference is made to exhibits LL#3 and LL#4 in support
of their testimony.  
13.  
RL testified that on
December 19, 2017, he received an emergency call from the Tenant that morning
about a flood/leak in the rental unit.  RL played a video clip he took later
that day to show when he came to inspect the unit, and also submitted exhibit
LL#5, which comprises text message exchanges between RL and YL dated December
19th and 20th.  RL testified that when he arrived, there
was no sign of any emergency leak in the basement.
14.  
YL submitted 6 photographs
(exhibits TT#3 to TT#8) that she testified were taken early on December 19th,
and which evidence the large amount of water leaking into her sons’ bedroom. YL
confirmed she called RL around 5:30 am that morning about the leak.
15.  
JE testified that she
attended the rental unit after 6:00 am on December 19th and
witnessed about 1-1/2 inches of water leaking “everywhere” and especially into
the sons’ bedroom.  JE described how she assisted YL in trying to mop up the
water using a series of towels and other implements.  JE is married to YL’s
ex-spouse, and had arrived to pick up the children.
16.  
On this particular
Landlords’ claim, I find that the evidence and testimonies, especially that of
JE, support the Tenant’s version of events over the version claimed by the
Landlords.  Specifically, I believe that there had been a serious leak of water
that occurred in the rental unit in the early hours of December 19, 2017. 
Based on this, I do not find that the Tenant substantially interfered with the
Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment or lawful rights.  The Tenant did what a
responsible tenant is supposed to do in these circumstances.  As such, I am
denying this L2 claim, which is the substantive part of the L2 application.
17.  
The Landlords testified that
the Tenant also removed a light dome and laundry room door, dismantled the
carbon monoxide detector, had interfered with Landlords entry into the unit by
placing “do not enter” signs and had cluttered the area around the furnace with
the Tenant’s combustibles.  The Landlords submitted exhibits LL#6 to LL#10 in
support of their testimony, which include reports from a Brampton Fire
Prevention Officer.
18.  
The Tenant did not dispute
the light dome/door issue, the CO detector dismantlement, the “do not enter”
signs and the items she stored in shelving units around the furnace.
19.  
Instead, YL offered
explanations that:  due to the December 19th incident, she removed
the door from its hinges when she dealt with the flood; because both of her
boys have ADHD, she removed the tinted dome from the light which bothered them;
the CO detector was beeping incessantly and she made the mistake of removing
the battery; her 9-year old daughter is the one who placed the “do not enter”
signs; the items stored around the furnace are in shelving units (per LL#10)
far enough from the furnace.
20.  
With regard to her sons
having ADHD, I read into the record the confirming report of the boys’
psychiatrist to support YL’s testimony.
21.  
YL stated she is quite
willing to re-install the laundry room door on its hinges, and she stated she will
ensure the CO detector is never dismantled again and nothing combustible or
dangerous is stored close to the furnace going forward.  With respect to the
light dome and “do not enter” signs, the Landlords were not overly concerned
with these.
22.  
Based on the testimonies and
submissions of the parties, I find on a balance of probabilities that the
Tenant did substantially interfere with the reasonable enjoyment and lawful
rights of the Landlord by dismantling the CO detector.  However, from the
parties’ respective final arguments and submissions, I further determined that
the sought after remedy of eviction is not justified under these circumstances,
so long as the Tenant: reinstalls the door on its hinges; removes the “do not
enter” signs and ensures the Landlords may enter the unit with proper notice;
ensures that the Tenant does not interfere with the CO detector’s operation;
and allows for a white dome to be placed over the light (if the Landlords so
decide to do).
23.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of
the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
L1 Application
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before March 3,
2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlords $690.63*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to February 20, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe
on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $33.19 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
February 21, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before March 3, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from March
4, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
5.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.  The Tenant shall
pay $190.00 according to the following payment plan:
a) on or before March 20, 2018:          $38.00;
b) on or before April 20, 2018:             $38.00;
c) on or before May 20, 2018: $38.00;
d) on or before June 20, 2018:            $38.00;
and
e) on or before July 20, 2018:              $38.00.
6.     
If the Tenant fails to make
any one of the payments in paragraph 5 of this order, in full and on time, the
full balance owing becomes due and payable immediately and the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from the date
of the missed payment at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
7.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 3, 2018, then starting March 4, 2018, the Landlords may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
8.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlords, on or after March 4, 2018.
9.     
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlords or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $2,018.82 if the payment is made on or before February 28, 2018, or
ii)       $3,028.23 if the payment is made on or before March 3, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
10.  
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March 4, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlords.
L2 Application
11.  
If the Tenant successfully voids the L1 application
portion of the order above, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant shall
continue but subject to the following order:  
12.  
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlords the lawful monthly rent in full for the 12 month period of March 1,
2018 to February 28, 2019, on or before the 1st day of each month. 
To be clear, the L1 application portion of this order allows the Tenant to void
the order by paying the full amount on or before March 3, 2018.  In this
respect only, the Tenant may pay the Landlords the rent for March 2018 on or
before March 3, 2018 and not be in breach of this L2 application portion
of the order.
13.  
The Tenant shall re-install
the laundry room door on its hinges so that it is fully operational on or
before March 3, 2018.
14.  
For the period of March 1,
2018 to February 28, 2019 inclusively, the Tenant shall not engage in conduct
similar to that outlined in the N5 notices served on her, and which form the
bases of the L2 application. To be specific, the Tenant shall:
a)   not store, or allow to be stored, for any
period of time, any personal items of the Tenant that are combustible or a
potential health hazard within two metres of the furnace.
b)   use proper metal or non-flammable shelving to
store the Tenant’s other non-combustible personal items neatly and safely away
from the furnace;
c)   not interfere or dismantle the carbon monoxide
detector(s), at any time, in the rental unit;
d)   remove any “do not enter” signs and permit and
co-operate fully with entry on proper notice by the Landlords or
Landlords’ agents for inspections, repair work or any other valid purpose permitted by sections
26 and 27of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006; and
e)   permit the Landlords to replace the coloured dome with a white
coloured dome, if the Landlords choose to do so.
  
15.  
If the Tenant fails to make
any payment in compliance with paragraph 12 of this order, in full and on time,
or if the Tenant fails to comply with any part of paragraphs 13 and 14 above, the
Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006,
without notice to the Tenant for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting
the Tenant.  The Landlord must make this application no later than 30 days after
the Tenant’s failure to comply.   For a breach of paragraph 12 above, the
Landlords can also request an order for rent that became owing after the date
of this order, and any NSF cheque fees and related administration charges.
