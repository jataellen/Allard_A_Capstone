Between:


Lynda Ripley Richard Ripley


Tenants




 


 
and


 




 


Greg Meers


Landlord



 
 
 
Lynda Ripley and Richard
Ripley (the 'Tenants') applied for an order determining that Greg Meers (the 'Landlord') has collected or
retained money illegally (T1 application).
 
This application was heard by
way of video conference on October 18, 2021.
The Tenants attended the hearing
and were represented by Christopher Hall,
Paralegal. The Landlord
was not present despite being
served with notice of hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants’ T1 application was filed on August 7, 2020. The application alleges
that the Landlord collected or
retained a money illegally and that the parties entered into a tenancy
agreement, but the Landlord did not allow the Tenant to move in and did not
return the Tenants’ deposit.
 
2.    
The rental unit is a single detached dwelling.
 
Tenant’s evidence:
 
3.    
The Tenants testified that on June 17, 2020 they
saw a “for rent” sign on the front lawn of
the rental unit and met with the Landlord the same day to inquire about renting
the unit.
 
4.     The Landlord advised the Tenants that the rental unit
required repairs prior to be being rented but assured the Tenants that if they paid $5,500.00 to the Landlord, the
rental unit would be ready within
a one-month period.
The Tenant paid to the Landlord
$5,500.00 in cash for the repairs to
be done and to hold the rental unit for the Tenant. The Landlord provided the Tenant with a set of keys and the parties
orally agreed to a
4-year fixed term tenancy agreement commencing August 1, 2020 with the monthly
rent being $1,175.00 per month.




 
5.    
The Tenants testified that after the exchange of the funds and keys, the Landlord
advised the Tenants that he uses the services
of a 3rd party property management company. The Landlord
told the Tenants to contact the property management company directly to execute
a standard lease agreement. The
property management company was Home
to Home Property Management.
 
6.    
On June 19, 2020 the Tenant
Richard Ripley attended the office of the Landlord’s property management company. The
Landlord’s property manager
advised the Tenant that he had to pay first and last months rent and complete
a rental application providing personal and
financial information. The Tenant
testified that he made the property manager aware of his previous oral
agreement with the Landlord, but to avoid conflict proceeded to pay $2,350.00
and completed the rental application as required.
 
7.    
On June 24, 2020 the Tenant
Richard Ripley attended the office of the Landlord’s property manager
and was advised
that the Landlord
was unable to provide the Tenants
with a 4-year fixed term lease, but rather a 1-year fixed term. The Tenant advised the property manager
that this 4-year agreement had already been agreed upon between him and the Landlord and that
he refused to sign a lease for a 1-year fixed term. As the
parties could not agree on the terms of the lease, the Tenant returned the keys
to the Landlord’s property manager and was refunded his first and last months
rent deposit of
$2,350.00. The Tenant inquired
about the additional $5,500.00 payment made on June 17, 2020 and was told to take this
up directly with the Landlord.
 
8.     The Tenant contacted
the Landlord directly
to inquire about the return of his additional
$5,500.00 deposit paid and was
advised that the Landlord did not have the funds and would need to contact
the property manager.
The Tenants stated that since this incident, neither the Landlord nor the
property manager have returned the funds.
 
Analysis:
 
9.    
The relevant sections of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the Act) state:
 
105  
(1) The only security deposit
that a landlord may collect
is a rent deposit collected in accordance with section 106. 2006, c. 17, s. 105 (1).
 
Definition
 
(2)  
In this section and in section
106,
 
“security deposit” means money,
property or a right paid or given by, or on behalf of, a tenant of a rental
unit to a landlord or to anyone on the landlord’s behalf to be held by or for
the account of the landlord as security for the performance of an obligation or the payment
of a liability of the tenant or to be returned to the tenant upon the
happening of a condition.




 
106  
(1) A landlord
may require a tenant to pay a rent deposit
with respect to a tenancy
if the landlord does so on or before entering into the tenancy
agreement.
 
(2)    
The amount of a rent deposit
shall not be more than the lesser of the amount of rent for one rent period and the amount
of rent for one month
 
134  
(1) Unless otherwise
prescribed, no landlord
shall, directly or indirectly, with respect
to any rental unit,
 
(b) require or attempt to require a tenant
or prospective tenant to pay any consideration for goods or services as a
condition for granting the tenancy or continuing to permit occupancy of a rental unit if that consideration is in addition to the rent the tenant is
lawfully required to pay to the landlord; or
 
 
135  
(1). A tenant or former
tenant of a rental unit may apply to the Board for an order that the landlord, superintendent or agent of the landlord
pay to the tenant any money the person collected or
retained in contravention of this Act or the Tenant Protection Act, 1997.
 
(2). A prospective tenant
may apply to the Board for an order under subsection (1)
 
 
10.  The Tenants were consistent and credible throughout the proceeding and the Landlord was not present to dispute the
evidence.
 
11.  I accept the Tenants’ testimony that the parties
entered into an oral and/or implied tenancy agreement on June 17, 2020 when the
Tenants provided the Landlord with the cash payment upfront
and the keys were exchanged. Pursuant to section
2 of the Act, a tenancy
agreement a written,
oral or implied agreement between
a tenant and a landlord for occupancy of a rental unit.
 
12.  Based on the uncontested evidence before the Board, I
am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that in addition to paying a rent
deposit equal to one month’s rent, the
Tenant was required by the Landlord or the Landlord’s agent to pay an additional rent deposit of $5,500.00 as a condition
for granting the tenancy. This is an illegal charge because it is prohibited
under sections 106 and 134 (2) of the Act.
 
 
13.    As such, I find the Tenant’s are entitled to reimbursement of the $5,500.00
illegal charge and
reimbursement for their costs of filing the application in the amount $53.00.




 
It is
ordered that:
 
 
1.    
The Landlord shall pay to the Tenants the sum of $5,500.00. This
amount represents the amount collected as a condition for granting a tenancy for the tenant
or prospective which is contravention of the Act.
 
2.     The Landlord shall also pay to the Tenants $53.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     The total amount
the Landlord owes to the Tenants is $5,553.00.
 
4.     If the Landlord does not pay the Tenants the full
amount owing by March 7, 2022, the Landlord
will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 8, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
 
5.     The Tenants have the right, at any time, to collect the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
