Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-03478-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


BASEMENT UNIT, 3198
MOONEE ROAD MISSISSAUGA ON
  L5L1S4


 




Between:


Hadas Elyas Ghebre Mekonnen Mesfin


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Kevin Brown


Tenant



 
 
 
Hadas Elyas
Ghebre and Mekonnen
Mesfin (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kevin Brown (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person the Tenant permitted
in the residential complex has seriously impaired
the safety of any person.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 956 0593 7653# on February
10, 2022. The Landlords,
represented by Seema Passi, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant stabbed
his roommate in the leg with a knife in the rental unit. The police
were called, and the Tenant was arrested.
 
2.    
The Landlords testified that they saw the wound and the roommate has vacated the unit.
 
3.     I find the Tenant has seriously impaired
the safety of other persons
and this act or
omission occurred in the residential complex.
 
4.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated, as of February
19, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 19, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.




File Number: CEL-03478-21
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount
owing on or before February
19, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 20, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 19, 2022, then starting February
20, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
5.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant
possession of the unit to the Landlords
on or after February 20, 2022. The Sheriff
is requested to expedite the enforcement of this order.
