In the matter
of:


1, 1500 POLONIA PARK PLACE WINDSOR
  ON N8Y4V5


 




Between:


Polish Canadian Centre
Association Of Windsor


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Ian Ross


Tenant



 
 
 
Polish Canadian
Centre Association Of Windsor (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Ian Ross (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the
Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the
order issued by the Board on July 16, 2021 with respect to application
SWL-48300-21-RV.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved
by order SWL-54967-21, issued on October
14, 2021. The Tenant filed a
motion to set aside order SWL-54967-21.
 
This motion was heard by video conference on December 14, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s agent, M. Bojsan,
the Landlord’s legal
representative, T. Currie,
and the Tenant attended the hearing. The Tenant spoke to Tenant Duty Counsel
prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord
alleged that the Tenant breached
order SWL-48300-21-RV, issued
on July 16, 2021,
by failing to make the arrears payment in September, 2021, and also by failing to pay the rent for September,
2021, by the first day of that month.
 
2.    
The Tenant
admits that he paid the rent late in September, and he thereby
breached the order
SWL-48300-21-RV.
 
3.    
Order SWL-48300-21-RV was a review
order of set aside order
SWL-48300-21-SA.
 
4.    
The monthly
rent is $749.00.
 
5.    
The Tenant said that he
had spoken to the Landlord about paying late in September, 2021, and they
granted him an “indulgence”. He said
that he has not paid the rent for October, November or December, 2021, because he was not sure what to do when the




 
Landlord “went back on” the agreement of the indulgence. He said that he preferred to wait to see what would happen at the hearing of his set
aside motion.
 
6.    
The Tenant said that he
works for a union since September, 2021, and he income fluctuates to an average
of about $2,000.00 per month. He said
that his son recently returned to live with him and he will be receiving the child tax credit of about $700.00
per month.
 
7.    
The
Tenant said that he did not find work until September, 2021, and that was why
he could not make the September, 2021, payments on time. He said that he had to wait until
he received some paycheques.
 
8.    
The Tenant
said that he has been living in the rental
unit for about 10 years,
and he never had problems paying the rent until the Covid pandemic. He said that he does not want his child to
have to transfer to another school. The
Tenant said that he has requested “indulgences” in the past, and he will never
ask the Landlord for another.
 
9.    
The Tenant submits that
he has lived in the rental unit for 10 years, and he wishes to remain in the
unit. He said that he now has a
better job, and his girlfriend has found work.
He submits that he has asked for indulgences in the past, and he does not intend
to ask for any more.
 
10.  The Landlord submits
that there have now been three different
hearings when the Tenant
promised to pay the rent on time, and he has breached each time. The Landlord submits that the arrears are
now higher than they were at the previous hearing, and the Tenant always
provides the same excuse of having just found work that permits him to pay the
rent going forward. The Landlord
requests that the stay on the eviction order be lifted.
 
11.  I find that the Tenant did not provide any reasonable explanation for not having
paid rent since September,
2021, when he allegedly found work. His
professed income would have enabled him to continue meeting the payment plan
since September, 2021, yet he has not kept to it. Consequently, I do not find that the Tenant has given evidence
that proves, on a balance of probabilities, that he is able to pay the rent in
full going forward.
 
12.  Having considered all of the disclosed
circumstances above in accordance with subsection 78(11) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”), I find that it would be unfair to set
aside eviction order SWL-54967-21. In
particular, the Tenant is unlikely to pay his rent in full and on time as it
becomes due and owing. The arrears are now substantial, and they are higher than they were in July, 2021. I find it is prejudicial to the Landlord for
the tenancy to continue.
 
13.  Considering the length of the tenancy,
I find that it would not be unfair to provide the Tenant more time to find an
alternative place to live.
 
It
is ordered that:
 
1.    
The motion
to set aside Order SWL-54967-21, issued on October
14, 2021, is denied.




 
 
 
2.    
The stay of order SWL-54967-21 is lifted January
31, 2022.
