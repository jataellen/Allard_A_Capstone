In the
  matter of:


BASEMENT UNIT, 17 DARNBOROUGH WAY SCARBOROUGH ON M1W2G2


 




Between:


Ying Wang


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Dianne Fuller


Tenant



 
 
 
Ying Wang (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dianne Fuller
(the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for
the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on January
18, 2022. The Landlord
and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The termination date on the N12 notice to terminate
the tenancy served
on the Tenant is September 1,
2021. The Landlord confirmed the rent
is due on the 1st day of each month. The Tenant testified that she moved
into the rental unit on April 1, 2013. As
a result, the termination date on the notice is not the last day of a term as
required under section 44 of the Residential Tenancies Act.
 
2.     In addition, the Landlord did not pay to the Tenant one-month compensation as required under the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
