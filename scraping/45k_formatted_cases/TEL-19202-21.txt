In the matter
of:


28 PARKER DRIVE ROSENEATH ON K0K2X0


 




Between:


Maria Antonietta Trombacco


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


David Buchbinder


Tenant



 
 
 
Maria Antonietta Trombacco (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict David Buchbinder (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 988 4914 7021#
on January 11, 2022.
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
L1 Application:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total
rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from April 1, 2021 to November 1, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination.
 
2.    
The Landlord collected a rent
deposit of $1,600.00 from the Tenant and this deposit was applied to the rent for the month of October, 2021. The Tenant
vacated the rental
unit on November 1, 2021.
 
3.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 23, 2020 to October 31, 2021.
 
4.     The monthly rent is
$1,600.00.
 
5.    
The parties had a side contract
for work performed by the Tenant.
The parties agreed that certain amounts would be
deducted from the rent for work performed.




 
6.    
It was undisputed that the Tenant had paid only $1,200.00 for rent in the month of April, 2021, and he had paid $1,400.00 for
rent in May, 2021. The Landlord had
deducted
$200.00 off the rent in April,
2021, for work performed by the Tenant, and she had therefore noted on her N4 notice of termination, and on her L1 application, that $1,400.00 rent
was paid in April, 2021.
 
7.     The Tenant disputes
that $400.00 arrears
is owed. He said that he had performed more work for the Landlord for which he
should have been credited a greater deduction from the rent.
 
8.     I find that it is undisputed that the Tenant actually
owes $600.00 in rent arrears. However, the Landlord has credited the Tenant
with an extra $200.00 for work he performed,
so I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Landlord
has proved that at
least $400.00 arrears are owed. The Tenant did not vacate the rental
unit until November 1, 2021, and this was also
undisputed. He therefore owed the
Landlord one further day of rent
before he vacated the rental unit. The
per diem amount of rent is $52.60, so he owed this amount in addition to the
$400.00.
 
L2 Application:
 
9.    
The Landlord alleges that the
Tenant caused damage to her property, namely to a bamboo screen in the amount of $200.00, $250.00
to repair a sofa and a small office
chair. She also alleges that the
Tenant damaged two wall brackets at $25.00 each.
 
10.  The Landlord showed a damaged
bamboo screen, and she had photos of a very dirty
sofa and small office chair.
 
11.  The Tenant said that the sofa and chair were not in a pristine
state when he moved into the
rental unit. He said that they were not in a very different condition when he left. He said that the damage to the sofa and
chair is normal wear and tear.
 
12.  The Tenant said that he left the bamboo screen
outside for the Landlord to pick up. He
said that he told her he was going to leave it there, but she failed to pick it
up.
 
13.  The Tenant said that the only way to repair
a wall shelf and replace
was to pry out the wall brackets.
 
14.  The Landlord did not have any photos of the sofa and
chair prior to the Tenant moving into the rental unit. She had no documentary evidence of what would be required to
repair or replace the sofa. Consequently, I find, that the Landlord
has failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities, the damage
to the sofa and chair.
 
15.  The Tenant did not dispute that he left a bamboo
screen outside where he had every reason to believe
it may become damaged. The Tenant also did not dispute that he pried wall brackets from the wall, and
therefore damaged them.




 
16.  Consequently, I find that the Landlord has proved, on a balance
of probabilities that the
Tenant damaged a bamboo screen and wall brackets.
 
17.  The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$250.00, which represents the reasonable costs
of repairing the damage and/or replacing the damaged property.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant
moved out of the rental unit on or
before November 1, 2021.
 
2.     The Landlord applied the last month’s rent deposit to
the rent for the month of October, 2021. Therefore, the amount the Tenant owes the Landlord
for rent arrears
is $450.82.*
 
3.     The Tenant owes the Landlord
$250.00 for damage of property.
 
4.     The Tenant also owes the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing of $901.82 on or before February 6, 2022, the Tenant will
start to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from February 7, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
