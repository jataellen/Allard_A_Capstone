Lugano View
Limited (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Ruzica Sisko-Cicak and Ivan Cicak (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe. The Landlord also claimed administration charges related to
NSF cheques.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 1, 2021. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Franki Dash, attended the hearing.
As of 2:27 p.m., the Tenants were
not present or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from March 1, 2021 to April 30,
2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective March 27, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
vacated the rental
unit on April 30, 2021. The Tenants
were in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $2,000.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
incurred charges of $20.00 for administration charges
related to cheques tendered by or on behalf of the
Tenants, which were returned NSF.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $2,000.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
1, 2020 to March 27, 2021.
 
7.    
The Tenants
paid $1,000.00 after
