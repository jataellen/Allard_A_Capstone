Between:


Joshua Hynes


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Ron Friedman


Tenant



 
Joshua Hynes (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ron Friedman (the
'Tenant') because the Landlord has entered into an agreement of purchase and
sale of the rental unit and the purchaser requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
This application was heard via video/teleconference on November 18, 2021.
The Landlord. The Landlord's Legal Representative David Strashin, the Tenant and the Tenant's Legal Representative Nicole
Fazzari attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
1.    
This is an application under section 49(1)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act).
2.    
Subsection 49(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2006 (‘the Act’) which states in part:
“a landlord
who has entered into an agreement of purchase and sale (APS) of the residential
complex may, on behalf of the purchaser, give the Tenant of a unit in the
residential complex a notice terminating the tenancy, if the purchaser in good faith requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation
 
3.     On May 2, 2021 the Landlord gave the Tenant a (N12)
form notice to end the tenancy because the Landlord
entered into an agreement of purchase and sale
and the purchaser requires possession of the rental unit for the
purpose of residential occupation. The termination date in the (N12) notice was
July 31, 2021.
 
4.     The Tenant did not vacate the rental unit in accordance with the termination date set out in the notice given.
5.    
A copy of the Agreement of
Purchase and Sale was submitted confirming that the Landlord has sold the property to the Purchaser. The closing has since been amended
and extended to December 15, 2021.
6.    
The Landlord has filed a
declaration from a Rahmatillah Serri, the named Purchaser affirming his good faith intention to move into the property
and occupy it for his personal
residence for a minimum of one year.




7.    
The Landlord's Legal Representative purports that compensation equal to one month's
rent was paid by waiving rent owing for the month of June 2021.
8.    
The Landlord is seeking
termination of the tenancy on or before October 31,
2021.
 
9.     The technical requirements for granting an application under section 49(1) of the Act are
1)    
The Notice:
 
49(3) The date for termination specified in a notice given under subsection (1) or (2) shall
be at least 60 days after the notice is given and shall be the day a period of
the tenancy ends or, where the tenancy is for a fixed term, the end of the
term.
 
2)    
Declaration or Affidavit
 
Subsection 72(1) of the Act requires
the Landlord to file an affidavit/declaration sworn by
the person who personally requires the rental unit and that person certifying that they in good faith requires
the rental unit for his or her own personal use for at least one year.
 
3)    
Compensation
 
Section 49.1 (1) states - A
landlord shall compensate a tenant
in an amount equal to one month’s rent or offer the tenant
another rental unit acceptable to the tenant if, [emphasis]
(a)  the landlord
gives the tenant a
(N12) notice of termination of the tenancy on behalf of a purchaser
under subsection 49 (1) or (2):
 
Section 55.1 states - If the landlord is required to compensate a tenant
under section 48.1, 49.1, 52, 54 or 55, the landlord shall compensate
the tenant no later than on the termination date specified in the notice
of termination of the tenancy given by the landlord under section 48, 49 or
50. [emphasis].
10.  Clearly section 49.1 of the Act requires a landlord
who has served a tenant with an N12 notice pursuant to section 49.1 to pay compensation to the
tenant in an amount equal to
one month’s rent.
 
11.  Section 55.1 of Act provides
that the compensation must be paid to the tenant
no later than on the termination
date specified in the N12 notice of termination of the tenancy given by the
landlord under section 49.1.
 
12.  The Tenant's Legal Representative disputes the
Landlord claim that compensation was paid to the Tenant on or before the July 31, 2021 termination date, because the Landlord on July 28, 2021 demanded
that the Tenant pay the June 2021 rent to the Landlord, effectively rescinding
the waiving of rent for the month of June 2021. Consequently, compensation
cannot be deemed paid.
 
13.  I received extensive testimony from both the Landlord
and the Tenant and their respective
Legal Representatives during the hearing and was asked to refer to emails and text messaging sent to and received by the parties.
All recited their own interpretation of the legislation and how
it should be applied.




14.  Based on the testimonies given by both parties, I find the Landlord did not pay the Tenant compensation equal to one month's
rent on or before July 31, 2021 the termination date set out in the N12 notice
as the legislation required pursuant to section 55.1 of the Act.
 
15.  Section 83(4) of the Act states that the Board
cannot terminate a tenancy if the Landlord has not complied with the
requirement to pay compensation.
 
16.  All in all, I am not satisfied
that the Landlord
has met all the technical requirements pursuant to section 49 of the Residential
Tenancies Act.
 
17.  Therefore, pursuant to section 55.1 and section 83(4)
of the Act, the application is incomplete and must be dismissed because the
Landlord did not pay compensation to
the Tenant in an amount equal to one month’s
rent on or before the termination date in
the N12 notice.
 
18.  The order contains
all the reasons for the decision within
the order. No other reasons
will be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s application is dismissed without
prejudice.
