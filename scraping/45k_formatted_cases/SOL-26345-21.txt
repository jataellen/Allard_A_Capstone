Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26345-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


215, 205 MELVIN
AVENUE HAMILTON ON L8H2J9


 




Between:


Indwell


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Clayton Robins


Tenant



 
 
 
Indwell (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Clayton Robins (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex
has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after
the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 2, 2022.
 
Only Karin Joss and Stephen
Howson, on behalf of the Landlord, attended the hearing. As of 10:22 a.m., the Tenant
was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the
Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     For the reasons
that follow, the Landlord’s application is dismissed.
 
2.    
The application is based on two Notices
of Termination that the Landlord served upon the Tenant. The
Landlord served the first N5 on October 26, 2021 (the “1st N5”) and the Landlord served the second N5 on November 26,
2021, 2020 (the “2nd N5”). In both notices, the Landlord is
claiming the Tenant has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
of the residential complex for all usual purposes by the landlord or another
tenant due to behaviour issues.
 
3.     The termination date on the 1st N5 notice was November 3,
2021. This is critical information as section
64(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
states,
 
A notice of termination under subsection (1) shall,
(a)  
provide a termination date not earlier
than the 20th day after the notice
is given;
(b)  
set out the grounds
for termination; and




File Number: SOL-26345-21
 
(c)  
require the tenant, within
seven days, to stop the conduct or activity or correct
the omission set out in the notice.
 
4.     The termination date on the 1st N5 was only 8 days after the notice was served.
 
5.    
Therefore, as the
1st N5 does not comply with, I find it to
be invalid and the Landlord’s application must be denied; the 1st N5 must be valid for the application to proceed on a
2nd N5.
 
6.     This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
