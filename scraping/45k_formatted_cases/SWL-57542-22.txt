File Number: SWL-57542-22
In the matter of:      2 (UPPER), 70 LANGARTH STREET E
LONDON ON N6C1Z1
 
Between:                  Melissa Miles                                    Landlord
 
and
 
Justin Warren                                                                                                                     Tenant
 
On January 11, 2022, Melissa Miles
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Justin
Warren (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on
November 4, 2021 with respect to application SWL-50174-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenant was to park only 1 of his vehicles
in the driveway for the next 12 months.
 
On
January 5, 2022, the Landlord attended the rental property at approximately
11:45 am and observed the Tenant had parked two vehicles in the driveway (one
white Bell Canada work van and one dark blue Mazda 3 Hatchback). The vehicles
were still present in the driveway when the Landlord left the rental property
at approximately 2:00 pm.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Order SWL-50174-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 1, 2022.
 
3.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 1, 2022, then starting February
2, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
4.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 2, 2022.
