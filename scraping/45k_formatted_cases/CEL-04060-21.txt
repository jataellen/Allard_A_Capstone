Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-04060-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


BASEMENT, 46 CORDGRASS CRESCENT BRAMPTON ON L6R2A3


 




Between:


Charanjit Brar Sukhmander Singh Brar


Landlords




 


and


 




 


Javaid Iqbal Parveen Akhtar


Tenants



 
 
 
Charanjit Brar and
Sukhmander Singh Brar (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Javaid Iqbal and Parveen Akhtar (the 'Tenants') because they intend
to do major repairs or renovations to the rental
unit. The Landlords
also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on January 13, 2022.
 
Charanjit Brar, on behalf
of the Landlords, the Landlord's Legal Representative, James Hill and
Javaid Iqbal on behalf of the Tenants, attended the hearing.
 
Sohill Iqbal, the Tenant’s son, interpreted for the Tenant. The Tenant
spoke with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
Determinations:
1.    
The Landlords in good faith require
the rental unit to be vacated in order to do major repairs or renovations to the rental
unit. I say this for the reasons that follow.
 
2.       
The Landlord’s
application is based on a notice of termination issued pursuant to s.50 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act”) alleging the Landlords require vacant
possession of the rental unit to do extensive renovations to bring the basement unit up to code. The N13 notice is dated November
23, 2021 and sets out a date for termination
of the tenancy of March 31, 2022.
 
3.    
A letter
from Pennywood Construction Limited dated October
19, 2021 was entered into evidence. The letter set out the
scope of the work involved and included a start date of April 13, 2022 and an
approximate completion date of September 15, 2022.




 
4.    
The Landlord
testified that the construction company
will begin bringing
materials and tools/equipment
onto the property the first week of April in order to start the job as
projected. The contractors will be taking care of all necessary permits.
 
5.    
The Tenant did not
dispute the reason for eviction; he indicated that he intends on exercising his right of first refusal
pursuant to s. 53 of the Act and return to the unit
once the repairs/renovations were done.
 
6.    
It is undisputed that the Tenant received compensation in the amount of $1,150.00 pursuant to s. 54 of the Act on
December 9, 2021.
 
7.    
Based on all of the above,
I am satisfied the Landlords
have taken all of the necessary
steps pursuant to s.50 of the Act. I am also satisfied that the Landlords have
taken all reasonable steps to obtain the necessary permits for this work by
hiring a licensed contractor to handle the project.
 
Relief from Eviction
 
8.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. I accept that the financial costs
associated to any delay of would be highly prejudicial to the Landlord.
Further, the termination date still gives the Tenant approximately 2 ½ months
to find alternate, temporary, accommodations.
 
9.    
The Tenant requested
that the termination date be delayed by 2 to 3 months so he can find alternate
housing. Due to COVID-19 he could not look at any units, plus the rental
housing market is difficult. If granted the longer time, and he finds a place sooner,
her will give the Landlord
notice to leave earlier.
 
10.  The Landlord testified that it would be
difficult to give the Tenant even 2 weeks longer because the contractors will
be starting to move their materials and equipment onto the property the first week of April;
they will need unencumbered access
to the property and unit to
start the project.
 
11.  The Landlord also testified that it took her a long time to be able to find a contractor to do
the job, and this is the only time they have available
as once this project is complete their next job is out of town. The
contractor has already set in place the necessary rentals, including the workers required
for the job; if she alters their timeline there will be financial
consequences. The Landlord further testified that if the contract was lost
because of delaying the date the financial impact could be very high, plus
force them in a position of having to find a new contractor; available
contractors are scarce.
 
12.  The Landlord's Legal Representative
submitted that the prejudice to the Landlord of delaying the project could
be catastrophic to them both financially and with respect
to having the repairs/renovations done. The Tenant has had since November
to look for




 
other accommodations, and still has until the end of March to secure something; the Landlord requires the termination date to remail at March
31, 2022.
 
13.  This order contains
all the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated, as of
March 31, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 31, 2022.
 
2.    
If the Tenants do not move out of the unit on or before March 31, 2022 they shall pay to the Landlords $37.81 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from April 1, 2022
to the date they move out of the unit.
 
3.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 31, 2022, then starting April 1, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
4.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after April 1, 2022.
