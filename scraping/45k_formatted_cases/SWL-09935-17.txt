Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006

GIO (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict JM and KL (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe and because they, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential
complex have wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises; and
because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in
the residential complex have substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another
tenant. . The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenants to
compensate the Landlord for the damage. The Landlord also claimed compensation
for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Goderich on January
19, 2018.  The Landlord’s Agent, NG attended the hearing along with KM the
Landlord’s Legal Representative.  The Landlord's witness, RB, attended the
hearing.  The Tenant, JM, attended the hearing on behalf of both Tenants. The
Tenant spoke with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.                       
 
Preliminary Issue:
 
At the commencement of
the hearing the JM provided a note from the other Tenant KL and advised the
Board he was there on KL’s behalf.  The note indicated that the Tenant, KL,
would like an adjournment as she could not attend on such short notice. The
Notice of Hearing was mailed on January 4, 2018 for a hearing date of January
24, 2018.  Although the Tenant JM said they only received the Notice of Hearing
a few days prior to the hearing, they were aware the matter was being adjourned
when they attended the previous hearing on November 24, 2017.  The Tenants had
from November 24, 2017 to January 19, 2018 to prepare for the hearing.  Given, the
Tenant, JM said he was there on KL’s behalf I found there was no need for an
adjournment and the matter proceeded.
 
This matter was adjourned
from November 24, 2017 whereby there was an Interim Order issued, ordering the
Tenants to pay rent in the amount of $2,350.27 to the Board on or before
December 15, 2017 or they may lose their right to raise any issues under
section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 at the next hearing.  The Tenants have failed to comply with a Board Order and, as such, I will not be considering any submissions under
section 82.  However, the Tenants may bring their own applications should they
wish to raise any issues.  
 
Determinations:
 
L1 Application:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent they were required to pay for the period from March 1, 2017 to
November 30, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective October 28, 2017.
2.      The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit. 
3.      The monthly rent is $240.03.
4.      The Landlord is not holding a last month's rent deposit. 
5.      The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed. 
L2
Application:
6.     
The Landlord served a first
N5 Notice to End Your Tenancy For Interfering with Others, Damages or
Overcrowding (N5) on October 13, 2018 because the Tenants allegedly caused a
water line running under their trailer to burst causing damage in the amount of
$1,258.10 and because they had several fires and disturbed other tenants with
loud music.
7.     
The Landlord testified that
the Tenants failed to void the N5 Notice by paying $1,258.19.  I am satisfied
the Tenants did not void the first N5 Notice within the voiding period. 
Therefore the Landlord could proceed with the L2 Application based on the first
N5 Notice. 
Water Pipe
8.     
On January 31, 2017, a line
running under the Tenants’ trailer froze and burst the water main to the
trailer.  The Landlord said the portion of the pipe running under the trailer
was the responsibility of the Tenants to ensure it was insulated to avoid
freezing.  According to the Landlord the water main pipe from the Landlord’s
main T joint and the trailer was not adequately wrapped with insulation and
when the temperature dropped, the pipe froze and burst.  An emergency plumber
was called to repair the problem.  The Landlord submitted an invoice for the
repair in the amount of $1,258.19 (Exhibit #1).
9.     
The Tenant said he was aware
the pipe froze and had to be repaired.  The Tenant did not dispute the
Landlord’s claim regarding the frozen pipe.
10.   Although the Landlord did not claim the damage
on the L2 Application, the Landlord argued the amount was set out on the N5 Notice
and the Tenants were aware they owed the money. 
11.   I find that although the amount was not claimed
by the Landlord on the application and the Tenant did no consent to amend the
application to include the cost of the repair, I find because the Tenants had
notice of the amount there is no prejudice to the Tenant for the application to
be amended to include the damages in the amount of $1,258.19.
12.   I find the negligence of the Tenants to properly
insulate the pipe has substantially interfered with the Landlord’s reasonable
enjoyment and the costs of $1,258.19 to repair the pipe is reasonable in the
circumstances. 
 
Fires
13.   The Landlord claimed the Tenants were disruptive
by having large bon fires, burning trees and playing their music loudly, which
interfered with other tenants in the rental complex.  
14.   The Landlord said the Tenants would have large
bon fires on their lot which would scorch other trees.  The Fire Department
attend several times as a result of the fires.  
15.   RB testified that she and her husband manage the
trailer park.  RB said that they have warned the Tenants on many occasions
about the fires because of the complaints we receive from other tenants. 
16.   RB testified that on July 26, 2017, July 28,
2017, July 29, 2017, August 2, 2017 and October 22, 2017 the Tenants were
warned about having fires. The Landlord received a letter from the Huron East
Fire department on August 2, 2017 regarding a fire the Tenants had on July 29,
2017 whereby the fire department attended ( Exhibit #7).  The fire department
set out the rules under which one could have a fire stipulating it must be
small and used for cooking food. The letter advised the Landlord that if they
were to be called again then they would find the Landlord $350.00. 
17.   The Landlord submitted several complaint letters
from other tenants about the fires and the smell caused by the fires. 
18.   On October 7, 2017 the Tenants had a large fire
that day and the fire department was dispatched.  RB said the Landlord received
an invoice from the Municipality of Huron East in the amount of $350.00 for
attending the fire because it was not in accordance with the bylaws for
burning. 
19.   The Tenant agree that he has cookouts but the
fires are not that big and caused no problems.  The Tenant stated he spoke with
his neighbours and thought he had an understanding about the fires until he had
a disagreement with them. 
20.   The Tenant said he wrote a letter on September
1, 2017 saying they would no longer have fires that were not in accordance with
the bylaws.  However, the Tenant did admit that he had 3 or 4 fires after the
letter was written. This was evidenced by the invoice the Landlord received
from the fire department for the fire October 7, 2017.
21.   Based on all of the evidence before me, I find the
Tenants have substantially interfered with the Landlord and other tenants in
the rental complex and with the lawful, right, interest and privilege of the
Landlord by putting the Landlord in a position of violating a by-law.  The
Tenant continued to have fires which resulted in the Landlord paying a fee to
the municipality of $350.00.        
22.   Although the Tenants have resided in the park
for one and a half years and have paid no rent since March of 2017, it will
take time to remove the trailer. Having considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), I find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until February 28, 2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b)
of the Act.  Because the Landlord was successful on the L2 Application, the
tenancy is terminated on a final non-voidable basis.  The Tenants do not have
the opportunity to pay the rental arrears under section 74 and remain in the
rental unit. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the
rental unit on or before February 28, 2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $$1,258.19 which represents the cost the Landlord incurred to repair
the burst pipe.
3.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $2,666.50*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to February 2, 2018.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $7.89 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
February 3, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
5.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
6.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 28, 2018, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from March
1, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
7.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 28, 2018, then starting March 1, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
8.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2018.
