Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-20984-21-AM
 
 



In the matter
of:


3, 2571 EGLINTON AVENUE WEST
TORONTO ON M6M1T3


 




Between:


907037 Ontario Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Eric Mueller
 
and


Tenant




 


Mechelle
Meech


Unauthorized Occupant



 
 
This order was originally issued on December 29, 2021. It subsequently came to the attention of
the Landlord and Tenant Board (the ‘Board’) that the rental address failed to include the street direction although it was properly identified in the application. The order is amended to
correct this clerical error to provide greater clarity to the parties. The amended portions are
bolded and underlined for ease of reference.
 
 
907037 Ontario Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Mechelle Meech (the ‘Unauthorized
Occupant’) and for compensation for the use of the rental unit.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on
December 7, 2021. The Landlord’s legal agents,
A. Szymczuk and M. Ochoa, the Landlord’s legal representative, A.
Crupi, and the Unauthorized Occupant attended the hearing. E. Mueller was not
present or represented although properly served with notice of this hearing by
the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Unauthorized Occupant and
for compensation for the use of the rental unit.
 
2.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $940.36.
 
3.    
The Landlord’s legal agent, M. Ochoa, testified that when the Landlord took possession of the
residential complex, the previous landlord
provided the rental
information for each unit.
The Landlord’s knowledge and belief as a result of this information was that a
lease agreement was only entered into with E. Mueller and not M. Meech. On
December 12, 2020, E. Mueller
provided the Landlord
with an N9 notice to end the tenancy with a




 
termination date of January 31, 2021. M. Ochoa testified that E.
Mueller vacated on that date. On February 1, 2021, the Landlord’s agents
attended the unit for inspection and discovered M. Meech was still in the unit. At no point was a new tenancy agreement entered into with M. Meech. Multiple notices were given to her
to vacate the unit, but she did not.
M. Meech had not paid any rent to the Landlord.
 
4.    
M. Meech
testified that E. Mueller advised
her that she was put on the lease in the summer of
2020. However, she did not sign a lease agreement
because she was told that E. Mueller already informed the Landlord.
E. Mueller did not inform her that he provided
the Landlord with an N9 notice
or that he was leaving. She did not dispute that no rent was paid to the
Landlord since February 1, 2021.
 
5.    
I am satisfied that M.
Meech was not a tenant as she never entered a lease agreement with the Landlord. I am also satisfied that the Tenant vacated the unit on January 31, 2021
and the Landlord discovered M. Meech’s continued occupancy on February 1, 2021.
As such, I find that the Tenant transferred the occupancy of the rental
unit to the Unauthorized
Occupant in a manner that was not authorized by the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'). I am further satisfied that the Landlord did not enter into a tenancy
agreement with this person.
 
6.    
The Unauthorized Occupant was in possession of the rental
unit on the date the application
was filed.
 
7.    
The Landlord is
entitled to compensation for the use and occupation of the rental unit by the
Unauthorized Occupant.
 
8.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
9.    
The Unauthorized
Occupant testified that she has been looking for another apartment for three months
and she has not been able to find anything
within her budget. However, I find it would be
unfair to the Landlord to postpone the termination date after eleven months of
the Unauthorized Occupant’s occupation without any rent. As such, I find it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated as of January
9, 2022.
 
2.    
The Unauthorized Occupant shall move out of the rental
unit on or before
January 9, 2022.
 
3.    
The Unauthorized
Occupant shall pay to the Landlord $10,265.44, which represents compensation
for the use of the unit from February 1, 2021 to December 29, 2021.




 
4.    
The Unauthorized
Occupant shall also pay to the Landlord $30.92 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from December 30, 2021 to the date they move out of the unit.
 
5.    
The Unauthorized
Occupant shall also pay the Landlord $201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
6.    
The Unauthorized
Occupant shall pay the Landlord the full amount owing by January 9, 2022.
 
7.    
If the Unauthorized Occupant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing by January 9, 2022, she will owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from January
10, 2022 at 2.00% on the
outstanding balance.
 
8.    
If the unit is not vacated by January 9, 2022, then starting January
10, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (the Sheriff),
so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord after January 10,
2022.
