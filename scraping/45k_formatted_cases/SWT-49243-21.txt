dispute about the termination of the tenancy.
 
2.    
It was undisputed that
the Tenant paid $164.55 in rent to the Landlord for seven additional days after he moved out: September 1, 2019, September 2, 2019 and August

The Landlord’s evidence and submissions
 
8.    
KV has acknowledged receiving a total of $164.55 in payment from the Tenant
for rent of seven
additional days. KV acknowledged that they received an email from the Tenant on
May 26, 2020 and the Landlord refunded $164.55 to the Tenant on the same day.
 
9.    
KV acknowledged that the Landlord
could have resolved
this dispute by responding the Tenant’s email on time.
 
Analysis
 
10.  I find that on January
2, 2021 the Tenant informed the Landlord
by email that he has paid
additional rent for seven days. The Tenant asked for the refund of $164.55
unlawfully collected but the Landlord never responded to his email. The Tenant
filed the T1 application one month later.
 
11.  The Landlord refunded $164.55 to the Tenant
only after the Tenant filed the T1 application
and incurred the filing fee. Therefore, I find it is
reasonable to award the Tenant the
application filing fee of $53.00.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord
shall pay the Tenant $53.00
for the cost of filing
the Tenant’s application.
 
2.    
If the Landlord does
not pay the Tenant the full amount owing of $53.00 by January 24, 2022, the Landlord will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 25,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
