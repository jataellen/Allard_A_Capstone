Wintercreek Investments Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sharifa Manning (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard via
videoconference on June 30, 2021 at
1:00 p.m.
 
The Landlord, Wintercreek
Investments, represented by Denise Ranger, a licensed Paralegal, and the Tenant, Sharifa
Manning, represented by Daniel Greenya,
a licensed Paralegal, attended the hearing.
 
 
Preliminary Issue:
 
 
1.   
The Tenant’s representative submitted
that the N4-Notice to End your Tenancy For Non-payment of Rent was defective. He submitted that the rent period owing on the N4
notice is December 1 to December 21, 2020 and January 1 to January 31, 2021
when
in fact it should be
November 1 to 30, 2020 and December
1 to December 31, 2020.
 
2.    The Tenant’s representative submitted that the Tenant
made payment on January 1, 2021 and submitted
a “screen capture”
of an e-transfer to the Landlord confirming the payment.
 
3.    The Tenant confirmed by her testimony that she has
sent the e-transfer on January 1, 2021. By her own admission she confirmed that payment was not directed,
and that on subsequent months, February 1, 2021
onwards her e-transfer did direct payments.
 
4.    At the hearing
I rule that the N4-Notice
to End your Tenancy For Non-payment of Rent
was not defective and that the hearing would proceed.
