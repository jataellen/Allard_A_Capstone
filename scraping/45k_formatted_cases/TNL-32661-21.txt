Landlord’s representative David Ciobotaru attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
For the purposes of this order,
Mabel Lin and Pui Yee Maria Wong will be referred to as
landlords.
 
2.     In March 2020 the Landlords’ brother moved from China and has been living in the home. He has never paid the Landlords rent
or any other form of compensation to live in the home. The Landlords have asked him to leave and he refuses.

I find The Landlords’ brother is a guest in their home and there is no landlord and tenant
relationship.
 
It is ordered that:
