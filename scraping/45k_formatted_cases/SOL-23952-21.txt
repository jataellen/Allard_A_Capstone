Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-23952-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


BSMT, 5636 NORTH
STREET
NIAGARA FALLS, ONTARIO
ON L2G1J5


 




Between:


Corrina Kelly


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Tim Burley


Tenant



 
 
 
Corrina Kelly (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tim Burley (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex
has seriously impaired
the safety of any person;
because the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential
complex has wilfully caused undue damage to the premises; and because the
Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in
the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord in a
residential complex that has three
or fewer residential units. The
Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the
Landlord for the damage. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on September 16, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord attended
the hearing. The Tenant
was not present or represented as of 2:00 p.m.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit prior to the hearing
date. As a result, compensation for damage was the only remaining issue to be determined.
 
2.     I am satisfied, based on the uncontested testimony from the Landlord, that the Tenant caused significant damage to the
rental unit.
 
3.     I am also satisfied, based on the uncontested work
quotes submitted by the Landlord, that the amount
of damage is in excess
of the $20,000.00 claimed in the application and that the Landlord will incur costs of $20,000.00 to repair
the damage and or replace property that was damaged and cannot be reasonably
repaired.




File Number: SOL-23952-21
 
4.    
Pursuant to the Divisional Court’s decision in Beauge v. Metcap Living
Management Inc., [2012] O.J.
No. 1052 (Div. Ct.), it is not open to the Board to order an amount in excess
of that claimed in an application which has not been amended.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$20,000.00, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage and or
replacing the damaged property.
 
2.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February
6, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 7, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
