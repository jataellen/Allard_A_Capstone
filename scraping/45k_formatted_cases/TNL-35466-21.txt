Termination effective October 1, 2021.
 
2.     At the hearing,
the Landlord’s Legal Representative presented an arrears repayment
plan that was agreed to by both the Tenant and the Landlord. The
Landlord’s Legal Representative submitted a copy of this agreement to the Board

the monthly rent for the months of March 2022 to

fails to make any of the payments
in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates required then:
