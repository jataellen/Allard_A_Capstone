In the
  matter of:


BASEMENT UNIT, 65 HAMMOND STREET MISSISSAUGA ON L5M2A1


 




Between:


Sarah
  Raposo


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Marie-france Chasse


Tenant



 
 
 
Sarah Raposo (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Marie- france Chasse (the 'Tenant')
because the Landlord
requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit
after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in
Passcode: 926 3019 7558# on November 4, 2021.
The Landlord, represented by Peter Balatidis, and the Tenant,
represented by Furaz
Alvi, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     It is the Tenant’s position that the Landlord has
served the N12 notice on the Tenant in bad faith. The Tenant points to a text message on May 18, 2021, where the
Landlord mentions that she hasn’t really increased the rent in all of the years
the Tenant has lived in the unit and that a fair monthly rent would be
$1,000.00. This would be an increase
from the $900.00 the Tenant pays. The Landlord also mentions the cost of cable that she
has been paying for years and enquires about cancelling it or would the Tenant
pay for the services. The text goes
on to say the Landlord would continue to cover the internet and utilities which
are unlimited.
 
2.    
The Tenant submits the Landlord served
an N12 the following month.
 
3.     The text messages submitted into evidence shows that
the communication between the Landlord and the Tenant by text began on March 3,
2021, two and a half months earlier, where the Landlord
said she would like to chat about decisions she is making
in regard to the house and living space.
 
4.     The Landlord indicates that her daughter Victoria is
growing bigger and that she is looking for more space in the next few months.
The Landlord says ideally a new house but with the market so crazy she
will have to extend into the basement. She
indicates she wants to give the Tenant a heads up to make sure she has enough
time to find a




 
place that works for her. The Landlord also indicates she is hoping
to expand by the end of spring.
 
5.     Later in May, the Landlord
enquires if the Tenant has found another
place and to let her know to discuss options.
 
6.     The Landlord then tells the Tenant that she will be
selling in spring or fall when the market changes. Then informs the Tenant she doesn’t mind if things continue on a month to month basis. There is also a small exchange about the
impact of Covid.
 
7.     It is at this point the Landlord
enquires about the increase in
rent.
 
8.    
The Tenant does
not agree to the increase and the Landlord responds by telling the Tenant she okay with month to month with the same terms. This text is on May 20th, two
days later.
 
9.     It was the Landlord’s testimony that she began to work from home when the pandemic
hit. Around the time the Landlord was thinking
about selling and needing more space, her office informed her that
the office would closing and that employees would work remotely. The Landlord also spoke to the cost of
cable because so many people now stream instead of using cable and internet is
provided.
 
10.  I find the context of these text messages in
conversational. The Tenant testified
that she has lived in the Landlord’s basement for seven years and always had a good relationship.
 
11.  It is clear that the Landlord wanted more space for
her daughter from the content of the earlier
text messages. The Landlord decided
that she would return the home to a single- family home to provide this space.
 
12.  I find it difficult to accept that the Landlord served
the notice because the Tenant would not pay $100.00 a month more in rent. To serve the notice it cost the Landlord
$900.00 in compensation. The Landlord
will loose $10,800.00 in rent for the next twelve months as is required for the Landlord
to use this space under
the Act. This amounts to a cost of
$11,700.00 to the Landlord
by serving the notice and terminating the tenancy.
 
13.  I find the Landlord wants to return the home to a
space for her and her daughter and no longer wishes to have a tenant in the
basement under the circumstances. I
find the Landlord in good faith requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation.
 
14.  The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $850.00
from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
15.  Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period from September 29, 2014 to October 31, 2021




 
16.  The Landlord paid the Tenant compensation equal to one month's rent by the Landlord’s
legal representative informing the Tenant in writing that rent for October 2021
need not be paid in compensation.
 
17.  At the hearing the parties where asked for submissions on delaying the termination of the tenancy is it is found that the
tenancy will be terminated for landlord’s own use. The Tenant requested a delay to the end of 2022. The Tenant testified that she needs to save money to move. The Tenant works on a salary and when asked multiple times how
much she makes she could
not answer. The Tenant finally
testified she makes $1,300.00
every two weeks. I find it difficult
to believe that an employee does not know the annual salary. Therefore I have difficulty accepting the
testimony about how much the Tenant earns every two weeks. However, I think it is clear the Tenant is
of limited means and therefore I will grant a delay in terminating the tenancy. The Tenant has resided in the unit for
seven years and has paid rent there is no urgency for the Landlord to regain
possession of the entire house.
 
18.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until June 30, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of June 30, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the
rental unit on or before June 30, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$2,607.15, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from November 1, 2021
to February 28, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $29.59 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from March 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing
on or before March 11, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from March 12, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before June 30, 2022, then starting July 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that
the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after July 1, 2022.
