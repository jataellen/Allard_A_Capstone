Tenants




 
 
 
Kulwant Boyal (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Courney Ann Soares
Machado and Mohamed
Moati (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the
rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February
1, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Bavithra Vigneswararajah, attended the
hearing. As of 2:34 p.m., the Tenants
were not present or represented at the hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from November 1, 2020 to February
28, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 24, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants vacated the rental unit on
November 30, 2021. The Tenants
were in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $2,175.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of November
30, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.

for the cost of filing the application.

do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
