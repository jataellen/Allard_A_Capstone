In the matter
of:


UNIT 5, 2237 LAWN
AVENUE OTTAWA ON K2B7B1


 




Between:


Gordon Weima


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Ashley Rivington - Montpetit


Tenant



 
 
 
Gordon Weima (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ashley Rivington - Montpetit (the 'Tenant') because
the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
970 9628 3000#
on January 19, 2022.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s representative, C. Broeker
for K. Shaw, and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant raised
a number of preliminary issues
with respect to this application:
 
a)    
No declaration from the Landlord’s daughter
was filed with the application;
 
b)    
Part C of the application mistakenly does not include
reference to an N12 which was
served by the Landlord within two years before the filing of the application;
and
 
c)     
Subsection 51 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) applies in the circumstances to prohibit the Landlord from serving any N12 notice,
being the notice on which this application is
based.
 
Declaration and Part C Properly Filed
 
2.     During the hearing it became apparent that certain
materials which had been sent to the Board by the Landlord with the Landlord’s application had not been posted to the Board’s data base. During the hearing the Landlord’s
representative forwarded copies of materials which had previously been sent by
or on behalf of the Landlord to the Board. I
reviewed the materials submitted during the hearing, copied to the Tenant. I
confirmed
that the requisite declaration from the Landlord’s daughter had been filed and that the




 
Part C filed with the original
application contained reference
to the N12 which the Tenant
claimed had been missing.
 
3.     I found that all the technical requirements of the Landlord’s application were properly
met.
 
Application of Section 51
 
4.    
The Landlord’s application was based on an N12 notice of termination served under
section 48 of the Act.
 
5.     Subsection 51(1) of the Act provides that a landlord
may not give an N12 notice of termination under section 48 of the Act to a
person who was a tenant of a rental unit when it became subject to a registered
declaration and description under the Condominium Act, 1998 on or after June 17,1998.
Subsection 51(3) of the Act states that the prohibition under subsection
51(1) does not apply where no rental unit in the residential complex was rented
before July 10, 1986.
 
6.     I invited post-hearing submissions from the parties as to the applicability of section 51 in
the circumstances. I have considered
those submissions in making the determinations set out in this order.
 
7.     The Landlord did not contest
the following facts,
asserted by the Tenant, as they pertain to subsection 51(1) of the Act:
 
a)    
The Tenant took occupancy of the unit in May 2017; and
 
b)    
The residential complex was registered as a condominium in 2018, and so became subject to a registered declaration
and description at that time.
 
8.     I find that subsection 51(1) of the Act applies
to bar the Landlord’s application under section 48 of the Act unless the exemption in subsection
51(3) applies.
 
9.     The Landlord’s representative argued that the Tenant had failed to establish that the
exemption in 51(3) did not apply. I
note, however, that if the Landlord relies on that exemption, the onus for
establishing the exemption lies with the Landlord.
 
10.  The Tenant referred to a document signed by an
individual (‘JC’) which stated that another individual rented a unit in the
residential complex prior to 1986. I
must accord this evidence little
weight in that it amounts, at best, to hearsay. However
the Landlord acknowledged that he understood that units in the residential complex had been rented
out prior to July 10, 1986.
 
11.  I find that the Landlord has not established that the
exemption in subsection 51(3) applies. On the contrary he candidly admitted
to his understanding about rentals
in the complex prior to July
10, 1086.




 
12.  The Landlord submitted
that he felt the prohibition set out in section 51 of the Act was not
intended to apply to the
circumstances of his application.
I see no basis to issue an
order which contravenes the clear language of section 51.
 
13.  I find that subsection 51(1) of the Act applies to bar
the Landlord from serving the N12 notice of termination on which this application was based and that the exemption
to that prohibition set out in
subsection 51(3) of the Act does not apply. In
the result the Landlord’s application cannot properly have been based on a
valid N12 notice and the application must be dismissed,
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application to terminate the tenancy is dismissed.
