Betty J McGee Marlin J McGee


Tenants



 
 
The order
contained a clerical
error, this amended order
was issued to correct the order dated September
1, 2021. The amendments are underlined for ease of reference.
 
Capri Holdings
Limited (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Betty J McGee and Marlin J McGee (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on August 18, 2021.
 
Landlord's Legal Representative B Rubin and the Tenant
M McGee attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from
October 1, 2020 to August 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination.
 
2.    
The Tenant
is in possession of the rental unit. The
Tenant testified that his wife Betty
McGee passed away last year.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,327.61.
 
4.    
The parties
agreed that the Tenants owe $9,293.22 in arrears of rent and the Tenants have made no payments since the
application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord seeks a
termination of the tenancy as the arrears of rent are high and the Tenants have failed to pay the rent as it has become due. The Landlord
was opposed to a repayment plan as repayment, as
proposed, would take almost a year.




 
6.    
The Tenant requested
that his tenancy be preserved and that he be granted a payment plan for the
repayment of the arrears of rent. The Tenant testified that he is in receipt of
CPP and OAS benefits and works on a part-time basis. He testified that he fell behind
in rent as his wife died in 2020 and there were financial expenses regarding
funeral costs and payment of bills. The Tenant testified that he was advised by
Duty Counsel that he may apply for financial assistance through the Rent Bank and the EPIC program and that
he wishes to do so to attempt to obtain funding to pay down the arrears of
rent. The Tenant also advised that he can make regular payments from his CPP
and part-time job to pay off the arrears of rent. He testified that he can now
pay the rent as it falls due and repay the arrears in a reasonable amount of
time.
 
7.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant
relief from eviction subject to the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act. I find that there would be substantial prejudice to the Tenant to
lose his home as senior on a limited income, during the COVID-19 Pandemic, and
taking into consideration the death of his wife and the financial impact on the
Tenant’s finances. The Tenant’s proposed repayment plan provides bi-weekly
repayment and payments from his CPP at the end of each month. I find that
prejudice to the Landlord will be alleviated through the inclusion of section 78 in the order, in the event that the Tenant breaches the
repayment conditions in this order.
 
8.    
The Landlord
has incurred the cost of $186.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$9,479.22, which represents the arrears of rent
($9,293.22) and costs ($186.00) outstanding for the period ending August
31, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s application for eviction
of the Tenants is denied
on the condition that:
 
(a)  
The Tenants
shall make the following payments
to the Landlord in respect
of the monies owing under paragraph 1 of this order:
 
i.    $250.00
on the second Thursday of each and every month,
beginning on September 9,
2021 and continuing on to September 8, 2022, inclusive; and
 
ii.     $250.00 on the 4th Thursday of
each and every month, beginning on September
23, 2021 and continuing on to
August 25, 2022, inclusive; and
 
iii.    $250.00
on the last day of each month,
beginning on September 30, 2021 and continuing on to August 31, 2022 inclusive;
and
 
iv.    $273.10
on or before September 22, 2022.




 
 
 
(b)  
The Tenants shall also
pay the Landlord the rent for the months of October 2021 up to and including September
2022 in full, on or before the first day of each corresponding month. (On time payment
will begin in October 2021 due to the issuing date of this order.)
 
3.        
If the Tenants fail to make any of the payments
in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates required, then:
 
(a)  
The Landlord may apply
under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for
an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants, and for the payment
of any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not already ordered under paragraph
1 of this order. The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a
breach of a condition set out in paragraph 2 of this order.
 
(b)  
The balance owing under
paragraph 1 of this order shall become payable on the day following the date of default.
The monies owing shall bear interest
at the post-judgment interest
rate determined under subsection 207(7) of the Act.
