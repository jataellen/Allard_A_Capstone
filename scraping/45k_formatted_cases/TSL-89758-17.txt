Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-89758-17










 

K.I.L.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict G.M
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on April 11, 2018 and June 7, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative A.V and the Tenant attended the
hearing on April 11, 2018. Only the Tenant attended the hearing on June 7,
2018.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      At
the hearing the Tenant raised issues under s.82 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). If the Tenant is successful in these issues, the
Tenant will be entitled to a rent abatement.
Arrears
2.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from September 1, 2017 to November 30, 2017.  Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 26, 2017.
3.      The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
4.      The monthly rent as of the date of the hearing is $1,577.00.
5.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,577.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
6.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 1, 2017 to
September 26, 2017.
7.      The
Tenant has paid $13,039.00 to the Board in trust since the application was
filed.  Prior to the date of this order, the Board paid out $5,154.00 to the
Landlord. The Board currently holds $7,885.00 in trust. 
8.      The
Tenant did not pay rent into the Board for July 2018 and I received no evidence
as to whether the Tenant paid the rent for July 2018. Accordingly, this order
assumes rent was not paid for July 2018.  
Section 82 issues
No
written lease
9.      At
the hearing the Tenant testified that she has not received a written lease from
the Landlord. 
10.   Although
s.12 of the Act requires that a landlord provide a written lease if there is
one, the remedy for this is the tenant’s obligation to pay rent is suspended.
Section 12 also gives a landlord the option to provide an address for service.
The Tenant has an address for service for the Landlord; the Landlord provided
one in making this application. 
11.   Because
the Tenant has an address for service for the Landlord, I find that the fact
the Tenant does not have a written lease has no impact on the Tenant. There
will therefore be no remedy ordered for this issue.
Rent
receipts
12.   The
Tenant raised an issue with respect to rent receipts and then withdrew the
issue at the hearing.
Incomplete
renovations
13.   The
Tenant testified that on July 10, 2017 she received notice that the Landlord
would do some painting in the unit on July 12, 2017 but no one came to the unit
on July 12, 2017. The Tenant testified that she took July 12, 2017 off work so
she could be at the unit during the painting. The Tenant gave no evidence that
it was necessary for her to be in the unit while it was painted. It was the
Tenant’s choice to take the day off and so the Landlord will not be ordered to
compensate the Tenant for her day off of work.
14.   The
Tenant testified that on October 2, 2017 she reported to the Landlord that the
sliding closet doors in the bedroom came off their track. The Tenant testified
that this issue was fixed on November 27, 2017. The Tenant testified that
during the period when the closet doors were off-track the door would get
caught in her clothes.
15.   Based
on the Tenant’s uncontested testimony, I am satisfied, on a balance of
probabilities, that the bedroom sliding door closet was off its track from
October 2, 2017 to November 27, 2017. It was not reasonable for the Landlord to
take so long to fix such a minor issue and so I find that the Landlord has
breached s. 20 of the Act, which requires a landlord to maintain a rental unit
and residential complex in a good state of repair. 
16.   After
considering the duration of this problem and the impact on the Tenant’s
enjoyment and use of the rental unit, I find that the Tenant is entitled to a lump
sum rent abatement of $25.00. The issue had some impact on her but it was
minimal. 
 
17.   The
Tenant testified that the front door of the rental unit was improperly
installed and that there is a one inch gap under the door. The Tenant testified
that this gap allows the smell of cigarette smoke to enter the unit. The Tenant
testified that she has not notified the Landlord about this issue but that she
did notify the Landlord that she generally has issues with the unit. It is not
sufficient to tell a landlord that there are issues with the unit; a tenant
must notify the landlord of the specific issue unless the landlord is already
aware of it. There was no evidence before me that the Landlord could reasonably
be expected to know about this issue without it being reported. 
 
Front
door insecure
 
18.   The
Tenant testified that from July 1, 2017 to October 20, 2017 the front door was
insecure. The Tenant testified that there was vomit in the hallway outside her
door in September 2017. The Tenant submitted that the vomit in the hallway
demonstrates that the front door was insecure. The Tenant gave no evidence as
to who vomited in the hallway. If it was person who has legitimate access to
the building (eg., another tenant), then their vomit in the hallway does not
establish anything about the front door.
 
19.   Because
the Tenant gave no relevant evidence, I cannot find that the front door of the
building was insecure at any time. 
 
Elevator
problems
 
20.   The
Tenant testified that there was no working elevator from July 1, 2017 to
October 27, 2017. The Tenant also testified that she did not use the elevator
during this time because the posted license had expired. The Tenant testified
that she did not ask the Landlord if there was a newer, valid license for the
elevator.
 
21.   Because
the Tenant did not use the elevator, even if it did not work during this time
she was not affected. In any event, it was not reasonable for the Tenant to
conclude that the elevator was unsafe because the license had expired,
especially without inquiring as to whether the posted license was the most
recent one. 
 
22.   As
this issue, if there was one, had no impact on the Tenant, there will be no
remedy ordered for this issue. 
 
Air
conditioning
 
23.   At
the hearing on April 11, 2017, it was uncontested that the air conditioning in
the unit did not work from July 2017 through to the end of September 2017. It
is uncontested that the air conditioning was repaired on October 2, 2017.
 
24.   At
the hearing on June 7, 2018 the Tenant testified that she discovered on May 2,
2018 that the air conditioning does not work and she reported it to the
Landlord the same day. The Tenant testified that the air conditioning was fixed
on May 28, 2018. 
 
25.   The
Tenant did not testify as to the impact of this issue in the summer of 2017.
The Tenant testified that in May 2018 the lack of air conditioning was
particularly bothersome because the Tenant had a fly infestation at the time
and she did not feel she could open her windows otherwise more flies would get
into the unit.  
 
26.   Based
on the uncontested evidence, I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities,
that the air conditioning did not work for three months in the summer of 2017
and from May 2, 2018 to May 28, 2018. The Landlord did not repair the issue in
a reasonable amount of time and so I find that the Landlord has breached s. 20
of the Act with respect to the air conditioning. 
 
27.   After
considering the duration of this problem and the impact on the Tenant’s
enjoyment and use of the rental unit, I find that the Tenant is entitled to a
rent abatement of 5% per month for the months of July 2017 through to and
including September 2017 and for the period of May 3, 2018 to May 28, 2018 (for
a total of $301.37).
 
Amenities
 
28.   At
the hearing the Tenant submitted a copy of her rental application. On the
rental application there is a list of amenities written in handwriting. The
Tenant testified that this list was written by a salesperson employed by the
Landlord and that it represents what amenities were promised to be offered with
the unit. The list of amenities reads as follows: air conditioning, party room,
gym, bike room, three appliances, laundry in basement, theatre room, lockers
(no price yet), BBQ area/patio, parking ($75.00).
 
29.   Lockers
was crossed out on the list.
 
30.   Air
conditioning was addressed above in this order.
 
31.   The
Tenant testified that she has never had use of a party room, a bike room, a
theatre room or a BBQ area/patio.
 
32.   The
Tenant testified that when she moved in, there was no gym in the building. The
Tenant testified that she discovered in February 2018 that there was a gym and
started using it immediately. She testified that she was not notified that
there was now a gym in the building and that it is poorly maintained. 
 
33.   The
Tenant testified that she and her partner have bicycles and they have to keep
them elsewhere.
 
34.   The
Tenant testified that when she moved in there were no lockers available. She
testified that she was notified by an employee of the Landlord in late October
2017 that lockers were now ready, she responded asking when she could see one,
and she received no answer to her inquiry. The Tenant testified that she was
finally told locker pricing in February 2018 and by then she had arranged for
her own locker offsite.
 
35.   The
Tenant testified that the Landlord has not provided any parking. The Tenant’s
partner has a car that he parks in Mississauga because the Landlord has not
provided parking. The Tenant has not been charged for parking. 
 
36.   Based
on the Tenant’s uncontested evidence, I am satisfied, on a balance of
probabilities, that most of the amenities mentioned by the Tenant were promised
by an agent of the Landlord. Lockers was crossed out from the list and so it
appears the Landlord did not provide access to lockers. 
 
37.   I
have considered that the Tenant moved into the unit with the expectation that
these amenities (except a locker) would be provided, that none of them were
provided at the outset of the tenancy and that only the gym has since been
provided (and that it is poorly maintained). 
 
38.   After
considering the duration of these problems and the impact on the Tenant’s
enjoyment and use of the rental unit, I find that the Tenant is entitled to a
rent abatement of 5% per month for one year, for a total of $946.20.
 
Various
maintenance issues
 
39.   The
Tenant testified that there was vomit in the hallway outside of her unit in
September 2017. She did not report it to the Landlord, but she noticed another
Tenant had posted a sign about it on September 3, 2017.
 
40.   The
Tenant testified that a stain from the vomit remained in the hallway for
several months. At the hearing the Tenant submitted a photograph of the carpet
in the hallway, taken November 26, 2017. The photograph shows a dark stain that
could have been caused by vomit that was not properly cleaned up. 
 
41.   The
Tenant also submitted a photograph, taken November 26, 2017, of vomit just
outside the entrance to the residential complex. The Tenant testified that she
believes this was never cleaned up. 
 
42.   The
Tenant testified that the garbage chute area on her floor is poorly maintained;
people leave garbage outside the chute and this is not cleaned up by the
Landlord. At the hearing the Tenant submitted a photograph of the garbage chute
area, taken November 22, 2017. 
 
43.   The
Tenant testified that her photograph shows how the chute area normally appeared
until recently when a new maintenance person started. The Tenant testified that
she has not reported this issue to the Landlord. 
 
44.   The
Tenant testified that there are three washers and four dryers in the laundry
room and that they are all dirty and mouldy. The Tenant testified that the
washers are destroying her clothes: residue is getting on them, her clothes are
shrinking, and there is some problem with the colours. 
 
45.   The
Tenant testified that she had a fly infestation when she first move into the
unit in July 2017 but that she did not report it to the Landlord (she reported
that she had issues, generally). The Tenant testified that she did not recall
reporting this issue at all in 2017.
 
46.   The
Tenant testified that the fly issue recurred in May 2018 and that she reported
it to the Landlord on May 2, 2018. She testified that the Landlord told her
that they were aware of of the issue and that they had hired an exterminator to
address it. The Tenant testified that she later noticed fewer flies. The Tenant
did not report any further problems with flies. 
 
47.   The
Tenant did not report the problem with the garbage chute so I cannot find that
the Landlord was aware of it. I cannot award a remedy for this issue. 
 
48.   The
Tenant has not provided sufficient evidence to establish, on a balance of
probabilities, that there is any problem with the washers or dryers. The Tenant
submitted a photograph in which I cannot see any problem except that there is a
clothes pin in the washer. At the hearing the Tenant showed a video that she
says demonstrates there is mould in the washers but I cannot find that what I
saw in the video was mould. The Tenant did not submit any photographs of her
allegedly ruined clothes and it makes no sense that a dirty washer would shrink
her clothes. I cannot award a remedy for this issue.
 
49.   The
Tenant did not report the flies in 2017. When the Tenant did report the flies
in May 2018, the Landlord responded appropriately by hiring an exterminator.
After the extermination, the flies abated and the Tenant made no further
complaints about flies, so there was nothing left for the Landlord to do. I
cannot award a remedy for this issue.
 
50.   The
Tenant’s uncontested evidence demonstrates, on a balance of probabilities, that
on two occasions there was vomit in the residential complex, in plain view,
where the Landlord should have been aware of it, and that the Landlord did not
clean it up in a reasonable time. After considering the
impact on the Tenant’s enjoyment and use of the rental unit, I find that the
Tenant is entitled to a lump sum rent abatement of $50.00.
 
Cigarette
smoke in common areas
 
51.   The
Tenant testified that she has smelled smoke in the hallways and that she
reported this to the Landlord. The Landlord then put up signs prohibiting
smoking in common areas. The Tenant testified that she believes the signs have
been ineffective and that the Landlord should install security cameras. The
Tenant has not suggested this to the Landlord.
 
52.   The
Landlord responded appropriately to the complaints about smoke in the hallways
and so no remedy will be awarded for this issue.
 
No hot water 
 
53.   The
Tenant testified that on January 23, 2018 she noticed that she had no hot
water. The Tenant reported the issue to an employee of the Landlord immediately
and was told that the Landlord has not shut off the water; there was a problem
with hot water in several units. The Tenant testified that the problem was
fixed on February 5, 2018. 
 
54.   Based
on the Tenant’s uncontested evidence, I find, on a balance of probabilities,
that the Tenant had no hot water from January 23, 2018 to February 5, 2018.
 
55.   I
find that it was unreasonable for the Landlord to take 13 days to fix such a
fundamental issue in the unit, and so I find that the Landlord has breached its
obligations under s. 20 of the Act with respect to the hot water. 
 
56.   After
considering the duration of this problem and the impact on the Tenant’s
enjoyment and use of the rental unit, I find that the Tenant is entitled to a
rent abatement of 20% per month for a one week period, for a total of $73.00.
 
Fire alarms
 
57.   The
Tenant testified that on January 8, 2018, the building fire alarm went off from
2am to 5am. The Tenant could not sleep that night and so she was unable to go
to work the next day. The Tenant testified that she went to the basement that
night to investigate and some workers said that the alarm was going off because
of some pipes that burst. 
 
58.   The
Tenant testified that on January 24, 2018 a fire alarm went off at 8am and that
when she returned from work that evening the fire alarm was still going off.
The Tenant testified that from January 24, 2018 to February 4, 2018 she could
hear beeping and that this annoyed her. The Tenant testified that as a result
of the annoying beeping she lost sleep and so she lost a few days of work.
 
59.   The
Tenant submitted no written evidence at the hearing to support that she lost
any days of work due to the alarm issue. 
 
60.   There
was no evidence before me that the fire alarms were caused by any conduct or
neglect by the Landlord. Further, the Tenant’s testimony on the impact of the
alarm sound from January 24, 2018 to February 4, 2018 is confusing. She first
testified that it was a fire alarm, suggesting a very loud sound that would be
heard loudly everywhere in the building, then she testified that it was a
beeping sound that was annoying and then she testified that the beeping sound
kept her awake. The Tenant gave no evidence that she complained about this
beeping sound any time between January 24, 2018 to February 4, 2018, although
if she was losing several nights of sleep and missing several days of work it
would be expected that she would make some kind of complaint. Given the
problems with the Tenant’s evidence about the alarm from January 24, 2018 to
February 4, 2018, I am not satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the
Landlord substantially interfered with the Tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of the
premises by allowing an alarm to sound on these dates. 
 
Flooding in the basement, loss of laundry
 
61.   The
Tenant testified that on January 8, 2018 a pipe burst in the basement and this
caused a flood. The Tenant testified that as a result of the flood she was
unable to use the laundry room. Earlier the Tenant testified that she was at
work all day on January 8, 2018 so it was in the evening of January 8, 2018
that she was unable to use the laundry room. 
 
62.   I
cannot find that the Landlord breached its maintenance obligations under s.20
of the Act with respect to this issue. There was no evidence that the Landlord
caused the pipe to burst or that the Landlord did not respond to the burst pipe
in a reasonable or timely manner. I also cannot find that the Landlord
substantially interfered with the Tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of the premises
by failing to provide a laundry room when the basement was flooded. The Tenant
had no reason to expect to be able to use the laundry when the basement was
flooded, there was no evidence before me that the flood was the Landlord’s
fault, and there was no evidence before me that the Landlord did not respond to
the burst pipe in a reasonable or timely manner. There will therefore be no
remedy ordered for this issue. 
 
Total rent abatement
 
63.   The
total rent abatement to which the Tenant is entitled is $1,395.57.
 
64.   The
Tenant’s arrears are reduced by this amount and so I find that the Tenant owes $3,087.43
in arrears. 
 
65.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant 
It
is ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before August 3, 2018.The amount of $7,885.00 plus accrued interest shall be paid out to the Landlord.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $885.74*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to July 23, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $51.85 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting July 24, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before August
3, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from August 4, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before August 3, 2018, then starting August 4,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after August 4, 2018.
 
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $3,087.43 if the payment is made on or before July 31, 2018, or
ii)       $4,664.43 if the payment is made on or before August 3, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after August 4, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
10.   The
Board shall pay to the Landlord the amount of $7,885.00 together with any accrued interest.
