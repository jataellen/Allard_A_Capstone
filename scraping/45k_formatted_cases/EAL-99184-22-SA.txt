Order under Section 78(11)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-99184-22-SA
 
 



In the matter
of:


B, 188 KING STREET E BROCKVILLE ON K6V1C4


 




Between:


Andrew Shaw


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Cheryl Konowalchuk


Tenant



 
 
Andrew Shaw (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Cheryl Konowalchuk (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant
owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the
order issued by the Board on December 6, 2021 with respect to application
EAL-97736-21.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved by order EAL-99184-22, issued on January
19, 2022. The Tenant filed a
motion to set aside order EAL-99184-22.
 
This motion
was heard by videoconference on February 15, 2022.
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
The Tenant declined to speak with Tenant Duty
Counsel.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    The first issue before the Board is whether there was
a breach of the order in respect of application EAL-97736-21 as alleged by the
Landlord. At the hearing, the Tenant agreed she breached the terms of the
order; specifically, the rent for December 2021 was paid late; the payments for November 19, December 3 and December
17, 2021 were also paid late.
 
2.    This means I must determine, having regard to all the circumstances, whether
it would not be unfair to set aside the eviction
order. (See: s. 78(11)(b) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').)
 
3.   
This tenancy began five years ago. The monthly
rent is $894.00 and is due on the first of
each month. The Tenant lives in the rental unit with her two children ages 14
and 18.
 
4.   
The Tenant testified that she breached
the order in due to a drastic change in
her financial position and
had no intention to do so. However, as of the end of January 2022, she has




 
fully caught up and is confident that going forward,
there will no longer be an issue
with her paying the rent. The
Tenant prefers to maintain her tenancy.
 
5.    The Landlord confirmed that the Tenant no longer owed rent arrears for the period ending
January 27, 2022.
 
6.    The Landlord, relying
on subsection 78(12),
sought an order requiring the Tenant to pay
the rent on time for the next twelve months.
 
7.   
The Tenant did not oppose the Landlord’s request. ANALYSIS
8.    Based on the evidence before me, I find that the
Tenant breached the order issued on December 6, 2021 due to circumstances
beyond her control. However, as of the date of the hearing, the Tenant
has achieved a zero balance.
As a result, I find that it would not be
unfair in these circumstances to set
aside the ex parte eviction order and
grant the Tenant relief as well as a final opportunity to preserve her tenancy.
 
9.    With respect to the Landlord’s request, while it is not being opposed
by the Tenant, the problem
with the request is that the original application was based on a notice of
termination served for rent arrears and not persistent late payment of rent.
This is confirmed in subsection 78(12) which states:
 
78(12) In an order
under clause (11) (b), the Board may amend a settlement agreed to under section 194 or an order
made with respect to the previous application
if it considers it appropriate to do so.
 
[Emphasis added.]
 
10. In this case, the previous application was with
respect to rent arrears; the prompt payment that was ordered, only lasted
until the arrears were paid in full.
The evidence of the parties suggests
the Tenant has discontinued the arrears application to January 31, 2022. As
there are no arrears outstanding, I do not find it appropriate to grant the Landlord’s request for a prompt payment order.
 
11. This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order EAL-99184-22, issued on January 19, 2022 is set aside.
 
2.    
The Landlord's application under section 78 of the Act is dismissed.
 
3.    
The Landlord’s L1 application is discontinued to January 31, 2022.
