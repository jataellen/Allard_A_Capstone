In the
  matter of:


322, 4011 BRICKSTONE MEWS MISSISSAUGA ON L5B0J7


 




Between:


Victoria Park
Management


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Junior Lewis


Tenant



 
 
Victoria Park Management (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Junior Lewis (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 24, 2022. Only
the Landlord's Legal Representative, Sara Lange,
attended the hearing.
As of 10:21 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from May 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective June 28, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,159.00 as of January 1, 2022.
 
4.    
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant paid $4,859.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 28,
2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.




File Number: HOL-12037-21
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $3,225.83*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 8, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$38.10 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 9, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 28, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 28, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $4,266.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after March
1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
