634, 349 WHARNCLIFFE ROAD N LONDON ON
  N6G2V3


 




Between:


London &
Middlesex Community Housing


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Stephanie Lee


Tenant



 
 
 
London & Middlesex Community Housing (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Stephanie Lee (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order
issued by the Board on May 20, 2021 with respect to application SWL- 43457-20.
 
This matter was directed
to hearing to determine whether
there was a breach of the previous order, due to the lack of
details on the L4 application.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 25, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Candace
Aboussafy, attended the hearing.
As of 10:33 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     For the reasons that follow, I find that the Tenant
has not met the following condition specified
in the order: remain in compliance with conditions 1 – 3 of the order from May1,
2021 to April 30, 2022 that required all furniture to be used for its ordinary
and intended purpose, no combustible materials higher than 450mm (18 inches) or
less than this distance/measurement in width or from ignition sources.
 
3.     The Landlord's Legal Representative testified that the original application was based on a
London Fire Service Order dated March 6, 2020; the order was entered into
evidence. The order required: combustible material to be kept a maximum 750mm
(2.5 feet) in




 
height in all rooms of the
apartment; all furniture shall be used for its intended purpose; aisle to and from each room shall be a minimum of
750mm (2.5 feet) in width; and, combustible material shall be spaced a minimum
of 450mm (18 inches)
form all ignition sources.
 
4.     The Representative further testified that on September
10, 2021 the Landlord inspected the unit and found that many areas were not
cleared or kept as required by the conditional order based on the Fire Department’s
requirements. A number of pictures were entered into evidence showing
combustible materials throughout the unit higher than 750mm (2.5 feet) and pathways
less than 750mm (2.5 feet) wide.
Pictures were also entered into evidence from an inspection done on November
18, 2021 showing the unit was essentially in the same condition as the
September 10th inspection.
Due to the
Tenant’s non-compliance and her not accepting supports offered to her in the past by the Landlord, the Landlord is seeking a non-voidable
11-day order.
 
5.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. Based on the uncontested testimony and
evidence before me, the unit has remained in essentially the same condition
since the Tenant was required to take steps to bring it into compliance; the unit is a fire and safety hazard
that affects all tenants and staff in the building. The Tenant did not
attend to present me with any other considerations although being served with
the Landlord’s disclosure package.
 
6.     This order contains
all the reasons
for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.    
Order SWL-43457-20 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 28, 2022.
 
3.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 28, 2022, then starting
March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
4.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 1, 2022.
