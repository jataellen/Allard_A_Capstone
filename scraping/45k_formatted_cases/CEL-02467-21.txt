In the
  matter of:

STREET BARRIE ON L4M6K6


 




Between:


Coral Non-Profit Homes
(Barrie) Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Shelly
Marie Donald


Tenant



 
 
 
Coral Non-Profit Homes (Barrie) Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Shelly
Marie Donald (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has been persistently late in
paying the Tenant's rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 16, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s Legal Representative, Bryan Rubin, the Landlord’s Agent,
Janet Tibbits, and the
Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
On August 27, 2021, the
Landlord served the Tenant with an N8 Notice of Termination (N8) with a
termination date of October 31, 2021. The N8 seeks termination of the tenancy on the ground
that the Tenant
has persistently failed
to pay the rent on the date it
was due.
 
2.    
On January
1, 2022, the legal monthly
increased to $1,091.00
 
3.    
The Landlord’s Legal Representative submitted
a copy of the Tenant’s
rent ledger which showed numerous late rent payments
over the past year.
 
4.    
The Tenant
did not dispute the Landlord’s Legal Representative’s ledger
evidence.
 
5.    
The Landlord’s Legal Representative was willing to work matters
out with the Tenant
provided the Tenant stop being late with the rent.
 
6.    
The Tenant testified
that she likes living in her rental unit and wants to work with the Landlord in order to stay. The Tenant added that due to her income issues
that getting

the rent in on time was a struggle,
however, the Tenant did promise
to inform the Landlord ahead of time if there was
an issue before any rent came due.
 
Relief from Eviction
 
7.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and
204(1) of the Act. In making this finding, I consider the fact this is a long-term tenancy and the Tenant
does not want to move. I also considered the Landlord’s right to collect
the rent on the day it is due, being
the 1st day of each month.
In this matter, I find it appropriate to grant relief from eviction by
way of a conditional order that is subject to s.78 of the Act.
 
8.    
This order
contains all of the reasons
in this matter
and no further reasons will be
issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant
shall pay the Landlord the monthly rent due on or before
the 1st day of the
month for the period of February 2022 to January 2023.
 
2.    
If the Tenant fails to
make any of the payments indicated in paragraph 1 above, the Landlord may apply
to the Board, no later than 30 days after a breach of this order, without notice
to the Tenant, for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant
pursuant to s. 78 of the Act.
