Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-35039-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


710, 520 STEELES AVENUE
W THORNHILL ON L4J1A2


 




Between:


Azam Asadi


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Danko Yousefie
  Sina Yousefie


Tenants



 
 
Azam Asadi (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Danko Yousefie and Sina Yousefie
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 24, 2022. The
Landlord and the Landlord's Legal Representative, Azin Ghorbankhani, attended
the hearing. As of 10:13 a.m., the Tenants
were not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The L1 application is amended to reflect a $200.00 payment
made by the Tenants in June
2021. The total amount of arrears
owing at the time the Landlord filed the application was $7,000.00.
 
2.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from June 1, 2021 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 27, 2021.
 
3.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
4.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,800.00.
 
5.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,800.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the




 
parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenants, and find
that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 11, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$12,489.07*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 31, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $59.18 per day for
compensation for the use
of the unit starting February 1, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
11, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 12, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 11, 2022, then starting
February 12, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 12, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$14,386.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$16,186.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 11, 2022**.
If the Tenants
do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 12, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
