Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-42950-21
 



In the matter
of:


3, 205 SECOND
STREET SOUTH KENORA ON
  P9N1G1


 




Between:


Jeff Bath


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Jeremy
Asselin


 
Tenant



 
 
 
Jeff Bath (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jeremy
Asselin (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 16, 2021. The Landlord and the
Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord served the
Tenant with a Notice to End your Tenancy for Non-payment of Rent (N4). The rent
period in the N4 notice is from 01/10/2021 to 31/05/2021.
 
2.     I find the N4 notice
defective because it does not correctly set out the amount of rent owing by the Tenant for the period
claimed, as required by subsection 59(2) of Residential Tenancies Act, 2006.
The Board cannot issue an order terminating the tenancy without a valid notice
of termination.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1. The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
