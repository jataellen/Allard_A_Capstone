On November 12,
2021, Khang Pham (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jeffrey
Lambert (the 'Tenant')
and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant

Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant if
the Tenant did not meet certain
condition(s) specified in the

The Tenant
shall pay the Landlord $40.31 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 7, 2022 to the

on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January

file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
