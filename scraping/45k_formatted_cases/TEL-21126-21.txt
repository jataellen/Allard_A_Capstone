In the matter
of:


303, 40 CRAIGTON DRIVE SCARBOROUGH ON M1L2N7


 




Between:


DD Acquistions Partnership


Landlord




 


and


 




 


George
Sanchez


Tenant



 
On November 18,
2021,DD Acquistions Partnership (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict George Sanchez (the 'Tenant') and for an order
to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the Board on August 4, 2021 with respect to
application TEL-15994-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant if
the Tenant did not meet certain
condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed
to pay to the Landlord
$1,006.07 on or before November
1, 2021 towards rent.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $2,616.77 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
TEL-15994-21. The amount
that is still owing from that order is $1,736.77 and that amount is
included in this order. As a result, the previous order TEL-15994-21 is
cancelled.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,031.07 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021 to January 10, 2022.

It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TEL-15994-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 21, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,384.03*. This amount represents the rent owing up to November 30, 2021 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $33.08
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting December 1, 2021 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
21, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January
21, 2022, then starting January
22, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 22, 2022.
