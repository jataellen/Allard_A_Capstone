Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-52211-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


1203C, 75 ANN
STREET LONDON ON N6A1R1


 




Between:


Centurion Property Associates Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Aishwarya Arun Rahul


Tenant



 
 
 
Centurion Property Associates Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Aishwarya Arun Rahul (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay
the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 20, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s Legal Representative, Robert Rose, and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from January 1, 2021 to May 31, 2021.
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective May 1, 2021.
 
2.    
At the hearing, the Landlord’s Legal Representative submitted that the Tenant
vacated the rental unit on December 31, 2021.
 
3.     The Tenant submitted
that she gave one-month notice on September
28, 2021 with Tenant leaving by October 31, 2021.
 
4.     However, since the Tenant is required to give at least
60 days notice in accordance with subsection 44(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), I find that November 30, 2021 will be the official date that the Tenant vacated
the rental unit. Both parties
accepted this ruling at the hearing.
 
5.     The lawful monthly
rent was $688.00.
 
6.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $688.00
from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.




File Number: SWL-52211-21
 
 
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from January 1, 2021 to
May 1, 2021.
 
8.     The Tenant paid $4,095.98 after the application was filed.
 
9.    
This order contains all of the reasons in this matter
and no further reasons will be issued.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of November 30, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $511.45*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to November
30, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 11, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
February 12, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
