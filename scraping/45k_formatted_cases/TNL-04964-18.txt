Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-04964-18



 
 
 


 


 



 
 
 
 
 
RV (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict GG (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on June 5, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
 
 
Determinations and Reasons:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent she was required to pay for the period from February 1, 2018 to June
30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective May 11, 2018.
 
2.     
The Tenant testified that
she is living in the rental unit with four young grandchildren, aged between
seven and fourteen years old.  She was supporting them on short-term disability
payments and child tax credits until the payments stopped in April, 2018.  She
has been working to replace her short term disability with ODSP payments.  She
has not paid the rent since February, 2018, because she needed the money to buy
groceries for the children.  The Tenant has been looking for alternative
accommodation since January, 2018, and does not believe she is currently
eligible to go to a shelter.
 
3.     
The Landlord is seeking a
standard termination order.  She has not received any rent payments in over
five months and it is a hardship for her to carry all the costs related to the
rental unit.
 
4.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.  Although the
Tenant is in very difficult circumstances at the moment, she was unable to
propose any reasonable payment plan, and had no idea when she would have
sufficient income to make any payments towards the rent.  The lack of any rent
payments for over five months has severely prejudiced the Landlord.  However, I
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until June 30, 2018,
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.  This will permit the Tenant more
time to find alternative accommodation for such a large family.
 
 
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before June 30,
2018.
 
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $7,144.72*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to June 12, 2018.
 
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $59.18 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
June 13, 2018 to the date he moves out of the unit.
 
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 30, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June 24,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 30, 2018, then starting July 1, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 1, 2018.
 
8.     
If, on or before June 30,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $8,390.00** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after July 1, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
