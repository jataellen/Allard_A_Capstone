Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-90371-18
 










 
 
 

J.
H. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict L.
B. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Belleville on May 24, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      There
is no dispute between the parties that the Tenant has not paid the total rent
the Tenant was required to pay. However, the Tenant does dispute the amount the
Landlord claims is owing. 
2.      The
Tenant says that she paid the Landlord the rent due for the month of December
in the first week of December of 2017 by e-transfer. She cannot produce bank
records showing this transaction because it was from a now closed bank account
and she cannot retrieve those records. 
3.      The
Tenant also says that she paid the rent for the month of January, 2018 on or
about January 2 or 3, 2018 in cash; and that she made another cash payment of
$200.00 to the Landlord towards the rent due for the month of February, 2018.
According to the Tenant no receipts were issued for these payments. The Tenant
produced no bank records at the hearing to corroborate she had these amounts
available to her at the time these payments were allegedly made. 
4.      Based
on all of the evidence before the Board I find the Tenant’s evidence with
respect to payments made to the Landlord is not credible. I say this for the
reasons that follow. 
5.      The
Landlord denies receipt of any of these alleged payments. More importantly, he
showed the Board a text message from the Tenant on his phone dated December 21,
2017 in which she acknowledges December’s rent was not paid. That text
contradicts the Tenant’s evidence that she paid him the rent due for the month
of December, 2017 in the first week of December. Finally, it is not credible
that the Tenant could not retrieve from her banking institution banking records
from December, 2017 just because the account is now closed. 
6.      As
the Tenant bears the burden of producing sufficient evidence to establish it is
more likely than not that she made the payments she claims and her testimony in
this regard is not credible, I find that the Tenant has not paid the total rent
the Tenant was required to pay for the period from December 1, 2017 to May 31,
2018.  
7.      Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective April 7,
2018.
8.      The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending May 31, 2018 total $4,800.00. 
9.      The
Landlord incurred costs of $190.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
10.   At
a number of points in the hearing the Tenant started to lead evidence
concerning the Landlord’s behaviour that could be the basis of a claim under s.
82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). In response to my
questions she indicated she was not prepared to make a section 82 claim and the
hearing proceeded accordingly. 
11.   The
second disputed issue between the parties is the Tenant’s request for relief
from eviction in the form of delay. She seeks to remain in the rental unit
until July 1, 2018 because she will have another place to live then. The
Landlord opposes the Tenant’s request. 
12.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Act and find that it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. I say this for the
following reasons.
13.   This
is a short-lived tenancy. The Tenant moved into the rental unit on October 7,
2017 and lives there alone. 
14.   The
Tenant says she fell into arrears of rent when she lost her job in mid-January
of 2018. She applied for Employment Insurance (‘EI’) which got “messed around”
forever and a day leaving her with no income. 
15.   This
testimony on the part of the Tenant is also not credible. The same text message
discussed above dated December 21, 2017 says that the Tenant has not yet paid
December’s rent because she is waiting for her EI to arrive. If the Tenant did
not lose her job until mid-January of 2018 then she cannot have applied for EI prior
to December 21, 2017.
16.   The
Tenant also says she is going through a divorce. Divorce proceedings started 6
months ago and she has a court date on May 28, 2018. She anticipates she may
receive a divorce settlement, be in funds at that time and her assets will be
unfrozen. No corroborating documentation with respect to these statements was
filed into evidence. 
17.   The
Landlord says the Tenant’s non-payment is causing him some financial
difficulties. 
18.   The
residential complex is a 15 unit building. The Landlord says he has utility
bills and a mortgage to pay. He is a general contractor with his own business
but lately he has not been doing contracting jobs because he has been working
on the residential complex. He recently spent $5,000.00 for sewage repairs and
bounced his cheque to the contractor. He owes money to hydro. He is three days
late paying the mortgage and he has no line of credit. The Landlord produced no
corroborating documentation with respect to these statements. 
19.   After
the Landlord completed his testimony about his circumstances the Tenant called
the Landlord a liar and despite my requests that she remain, she walked out of
the hearing. 
20.   Given
all of the above, I am not satisfied that it would not be unfair to delay the eviction
as the Tenant asks. Her general lack of credibility means that I am not
prepared to accept that as of May 28, 2018 it is more likely than not that she
will have access to fund. Rather, I find that it is more likely than not that
she will neither have the means nor the desire to pay the Landlord any more
rent money and simply seeks to delay eviction as long as she can. As a result,
the Board’s standard voidable eviction order shall issue. 
21.   The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $800.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
22.   Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 1, 2017 to
April 7, 2018 totalling $14.70.
23.   This
order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further
reasons shall be issued.
It
is ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before June 8, 2018.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $3,910.71*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to May 28, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $26.30 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting May 29, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June
8, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from June 9, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before June 8, 2018, then starting June 9, 2018,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 9, 2018.
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $4,990.00 if the payment is made on or before May 31, 2018, or
ii)       $5,790.00 if the payment is made on or before June 8, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after June 9, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
