Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44666-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


28, 1634 FIELDING STREET SUDBURY ON P3A3Z3


 




Between:


DOJ Construction


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Matthew Hastie


Tenant



 
On December 30, 2021, DOJ
Construction (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Matthew
Hastie (the 'Tenant')
and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on
November 4, 2021 with respect to application NOL-43485-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the
Tenant to terminate the tenancy
and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.    
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order:
 
The Tenant
failed to pay to the Landlord $1,158.95 on or before December
1, 2021 towards rent.
 
The Tenant
also failed to pay to the Landlord
$450.00 on or before December
20, 2021 towards arrears of rent
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$8,973.90 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application
fee in Order NOL-43485-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $8,932.85
and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous
order NOL-43485-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,150.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.




File Number: NOL-44666-22
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 8, 2016 to January 19, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order NOL-43485-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 30, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$8,856.61*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to December 31, 2021 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $38.10
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
30, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 31, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 30, 2022, then starting
January 31, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 31, 2022.
 
 
 
January 19, 2022

The tenant has until January 29, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 29, 2022
the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on July 31, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before
this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial
jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
