Tenant




 


Emerson
  Rouse


 



 
 
 
581569 Ontario Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Emerson Rouse (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was
heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021.
The Landlord’s Agent, F.
Kunszt, the Landlord's Legal Representative, Dan Scofield and the Tenant
attended the hearing. The Tenant spoke with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Preliminary Issue:
 
The Tenant intended
to raise issues
pursuant to section
82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006.
However, the Tenant’s disclosure was sent to the Landlord
on December 16, 2021. As the Landlord was not prepared to respond to
the allegations given the short notice, the issues were not considered. This
does not prevent the Tenant from filing their own application at a future date.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from March 1, 2021
to December 31, 2021. Because of the
arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 8,
2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,062.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant made no payments after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Tenant, who has
resided in the rental unit for about nine years, testified that his finances
were impacted by the pandemic, but he did not receive the Canada Emergency
Response Benefit. The Tenant has savings and currently earns about $1,500.00
to




 
$2,000.00 each month but has not paid the rent
since March 2021. The
Tenant requested an extension
of the termination date to February 2022, but no payment plan was proposed.
 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,062.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period from October 16, 2020 to September 8, 2021.
 
8.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenant and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until January 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
Additional time given to the Tenant to either secure alternative accommodation
or pay the outstanding amount.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the
Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before January 31, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $9,353.37*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 11, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay
to the Landlord $34.92 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 12, 2022 to the date the
Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 31, 2022, the
Tenant will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from February 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022, then starting February
1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
February 1, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 31, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $11,268.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.




 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after
February 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
