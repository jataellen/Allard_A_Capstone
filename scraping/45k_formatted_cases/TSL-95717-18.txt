Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-95717-18
 










 
 
 

S.S.D
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict C.C.D
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on June 11, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
With respect to the L1
 
1.      The Tenant
has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
December 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination effective May 17, 2018.
2.      The Tenant
acknowledges that he has not paid any rent since December 2017, which he
explains is related to the maintenance issues discussed below. The December
payment was applied by the Landlord to the arrears for November 2017.
With
respect to issues raised pursuant to section
82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (ACT)
 
Heat
3.      The Tenant
said he informed the Landlord that his rental unit was without heat on an
unspecified date. He said it took until November 16, 2017 for the repair to be
done. He used the stove to keep warm so he did not pay rent for the month of
November.
4.      The
Landlord said she was not informed of the Tenant’s complaint regarding heat
until November 1, 2017. She said she had an electrician go to the Tenant’s unit
one week after she learned of the Tenant’s complaint but she identified that
date as sometime in the second week of November. It was discovered that clutter
blocked the baseboard heater in the bedroom but the baseboard heater in the
kitchen was not working and it was then repaired.
5.      The
Landlord did not present any documents to show the work that was done, by whom
it was done and what she paid to have the work done. 
6.      The Tenant
asks for a rent abatement equal to 2 months’ rent due to problems with heat and
sewage in the rental unit.
7.      I am
satisfied the Landlord did not act reasonably in taking so long to respond to
the problem with the heat in the Tenant’s unit. The Landlord did not provide an
explanation as to why a repair technician could not have been sent to the
rental unit more quickly. Accordingly, I will order an abatement equal to 25%
of the monthly rent for one-half month ($418 X 0.25 = 104.50 X 0.5 = $52.25) 
Sewer
Backup
8.      The Tenant
said the sewer backed up in January 2018 and sewage was 2” high in the kitchen
of the rental unit. He said it took 11 days from the time he notified the
Landlord until someone came to unblock the blockage. However, that person only
had a snake to use and it did not remedy the problem. After several attempts
over a number of days to fix the problem, it was finally remedied in the middle
of January 2018.
9.      The
Landlord said she was in India when the Tenant notified her agent about the
sewage problem so she contacted her brother-in-law who hired a contractor to
fix the problem. She said when that contractor was unable to fix the problem
she hired another contractor to do the repair. She also said it was a time in
Toronto when there had been a flood and everybody was trying to get help from a
plumber.
10.   Again, the
Landlord did not present any documents to show the work that was done, by whom
it was done and what she paid to have the work done. 
11.   I am
satisfied the Landlord did not act reasonably in taking so long to respond to
the problem with the sewer back up in the Tenant’s unit. Accordingly, I will
order an abatement equal to 50% of the monthly rent for one-half month ($418 X
0.50 = 209.00 X 0.5 = $104.50). 
12.   The total
rent abatement awarded to the Tenant is $156.75. This shall be applied to the
rent arrears owing by the Tenant.
13.   I have
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including the
maintenance problems the Tenant experienced, but because of the failure to pay
the monthly rent for so long, I find that it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before July 2, 2018.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,639.77*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to June 21, 2018 less the amount of the
abatement the Landlord owes the Tenant.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $13.74 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting June 22, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before July
2, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from July 3, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before July 2, 2018, then starting July 3, 2018,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 3, 2018.
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust: 
i)        $2,951.25 if the payment is made on or before June 30, 2018, or
ii)       $3,369.25 if the payment is made on or before July 2, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after July 3, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
