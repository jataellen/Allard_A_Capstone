Order under Section

Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-24159-21



In the matter
of:


301, 5 HAHN PLACE TORONTO ON M5A4G3


 




Between:


St Clare's Multifaith Housing Society


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 


Tenant




 


Sarah
Ombija


 



 
 
St Clare's Multifaith Housing Society (the 'Landlord') applied for
an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sarah Ombija (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Tina Le attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord served the
Tenant with a Notice to End your Tenancy for Non-payment of Rent. The Landlord
indicated in the notice that the Tenant owed $2,938.00 from February to April
2021, which meant the monthly rent is $979.33.
 
2.     The Landlord stated
that the monthly
rent is $980.00.
 
3.    
Consequently, the
notice is defective because it does not correctly set out the amount of rent
owing by the Tenant for the period claimed, as required by subsection 59(2) of Residential Tenancies Act, 2006. The Board cannot issue an order terminating the tenancy without a
valid notice of termination.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1. The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
