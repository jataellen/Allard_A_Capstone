Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: TSL-23820-21



In the matter
of:


709, 220 LAKE PROMENADE TORONTO ON M8W1A9


 




Between:


Lake Promenade Apartments Limited


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Evelyn Gonzalez Lucas Fitzgerald
Scott
Malcolm Fitzgerald


Tenants



 
 
Lake Promenade Apartments Limited (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Scott Malcolm
Fitzgerald, Evelyn Gonzalez and Lucas Fitzgerald (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 15, 2021. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Howard Levenson,
attended the hearing. As of 2:17 p.m., the Tenants were not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from August
1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective August 23, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,612.50.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,612.50 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from June 1,
2021 to August 23, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenants paid $4,412.50 after
the application was filed.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the parties and whether
the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 16, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$1,660.30*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 5, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $53.01 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 6, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing*
on or before January 16, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at 2.00% annually
on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January
17, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 17, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 16, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $4,758.50** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
17, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
