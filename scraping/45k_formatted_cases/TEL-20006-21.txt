Alexandra Hearns Susanne Brown


Tenants



 
 
Galaxy Value Add Ontario
Properties LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Alexandra Hearns and Susanne
Brown (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 26, 2022. The Landlord’s Legal Representative, Sharon
Harris and one of the Tenants, Alexandra Hearns, attended the hearing.
The Tenant was assisted by Tenant Duty Council Ms. Cooper.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective September 24, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,608.27
as of January 1, 2022.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,589.21 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
1, 2021 to September 24, 2021.
 
6.    
The Tenants paid $4,990.00
after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction subject to the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act.




 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$3,628.41, which represents the arrears of rent
($3,442.41), and costs ($186.00) outstanding for the period ending January 31,
2022.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant
is denied on the condition
that:
 
(a)  
The Tenant shall make the following payments to the Landlord in respect of the
monies owing under paragraph 1 of this order:

The Tenant shall also pay the Landlord the rent for the months
of February 2022 up to and including May 2022 in full, on or before the first day of each
corresponding month.
 
3.     If the Tenant
fails to make any of the payments
in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates required, then:
 
(a)  
The Landlord may apply under
section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an
order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, and for the payment of
any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not already ordered under paragraph 1
of this order. The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a
breach of a condition set out in paragraph 2 of this order.




 
(b)  
The balance owing under paragraph
1 of this order shall become payable on the day following the date of default.
The monies owing shall bear interest
at the post-judgment interest
rate determined under subsection 207(7) of the Act.
