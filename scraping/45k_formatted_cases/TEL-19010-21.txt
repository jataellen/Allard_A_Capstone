Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19010-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


478 ANNAPOLIS AVENUE
  OSHAWA ON L1J2Y7


 




Between:


Suhi Vishnumohan


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Darryl Soucy Kristy
Singleton


Tenants



 
 
 
Suhi Vishnumohan (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kristy Singleton and Darryl Soucy (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe (L1 application).
 
Suhi Vishnumohan (the 'Landlord') also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Kristy Singleton and Darryl Soucy (the 'Tenants') because they have been
persistently late in paying their rent (L2 application).
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 14, 2021.
 
At 2:00 pm, the Landlord and the Landlord’s Representative Bita Di Lisi attended
the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
2.     The lawful monthly
rent is $2390.
 
 
N4 Notice, L1 Application
 
3.    
The Landlord
served the Tenants
with an N4 Notice to End Tenancy
for Non-payment of Rent (N4 Notice) on July 25, 2021. The date of termination is August 16,
2021.
 
4.     The Landlord is seeking daily compensation and the application filing fee of $201.00.
 
5.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period
from March 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served




 
a Notice of Termination effective August 16, 2021.
 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $2,390.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from December
18, 2020 to August 16, 2021.
 
8.    
The Landlord
indicated that approximately 8 attempts have been made to communicate
with the Tenant to discuss the issue and a payment plan. The Tenant did not respond.
 
N8 Notice, L2 Application
 
9.    
The Landlord’s L2/N8 application is made pursuant
to an N8 notice served
on the Tenant on July 25, 2021 with a termination date of December 31,
2021. The lease was month- to-month
at the time of service and rent was due on the 1st of every month.
 
10.  Based on the oral testimony of the Landlord and the
contents of the N8 notice, I find that the Tenant has persistently failed
to pay the rent on the date it was due. As at the date of the hearing, the Tenant has been late
in paying rent 9 months in a row that first became due starting April 1st,
2021.
 
11.  The pattern of late payments
is unmistakable and persistent.
 
12.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of
the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find
that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
13. 
The order contains all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
Regarding the L1 application:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 20, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$22,967.09*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 9, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$78.58 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 10, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.




 
4.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
20, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 21, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 20, 2022, then starting February
21, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 21, 2022.
 
7.     If, on or before February 20, 2022, the Tenants pay
the amount of $28,180.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
8.     The Tenants may make
a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 21, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
Regarding the L2 application:
 
9.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated on February 20, 2022
The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before February 20, 2022.
 
10.  If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 20, 2022, then starting
February 21, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
11. 
Upon receipt of this
order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord, on or after February 21, 2022.
