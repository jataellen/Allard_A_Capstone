Review Order
 
Stephen Maier (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Danielle Meier (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved by order SWL-51473-21 issued on September
23, 2021. On September 25,
2021, the Tenant requested a review of the order.
On September
29, 2021 interim
order SWL-51473-21-RV -IN was issued,
staying the order issued on September 23, 2021.
 
The review request
was held by videoconference on December 21, 2021.
Only the Landlord’s Representative, S. Pereira attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
Since the Tenant did not
attend the hearing
to support her review, I find it abandoned.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s Representative indicated the Tenant voided the order on September
23, 2021 and she had discussions with the Tenant’s Representative on the
issue. The Landlord’s Representative is seeking costs for having to attend the
review hearing unnecessarily since the Tenant’s Representative did not withdraw
the review request knowing the L1 application was discontinued to September 31,
2021.
 
3.    
Interim order
SWL-51473-21 issued on September 23, 2021 states,
“ A failure to attend
the review hearing may be viewed as an abuse of process and may result in costs
being ordered against the Tenant”.




File Number: SWL-51473-21-RV
 
4.    
Since the Tenant did not attend to support
the review and by not withdrawing the request,
the Tenant has wasted the Board’s and the Landlord’s time and resources.
 
5.    
The Tenant therefore owes the Landlord
$100.00 for costs for their
time (1 hour) having to
attend and prepare for the review hearing.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The request
to review order SWL-51473-21 issued on September
23, 2021 is denied.
The order is confirmed and remains unchanged.
 
2.    
The interim
order issued on September 29, 2021 is cancelled. The stay of order SWL- 51473-21 is lifted.
 
3.    
On or before January
20, 2022, the Tenant shall
pay the Landlord’s costs of
$100.00.
