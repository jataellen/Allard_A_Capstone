Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-02758-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


21 ALPHONSUS COURT TOTTENHAM ON L0G1W0


 




Between:


Amber Ireland


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Theresa
Shareck


Tenant



 
 
 
Amber Ireland
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Theresa Shareck (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on January 24, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord and the Property
Manager, Trish Kennedy,
attended the hearing. As of 10:41 a.m., the
Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective August 31, 2021.
 
2.    
I find that the tenancy ended on January
1, 2022, the date the Landlord regained possession of the rental.
 
3.    
The Tenant owes $6,010.00 in rental arrears
to June 30, 2020. The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $2,000.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
4.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 1, 2020 to August 31, 2021.
 
5.    
This order contains all the reasons
for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is
ordered that:




File Number: CEL-02758-21
 
1.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$7,153.23*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 2, 2022 the date the Landlord received
vacant possession, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes
on the rent deposit.
.
2.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
21, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 22, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
