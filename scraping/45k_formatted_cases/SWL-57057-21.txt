Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57057-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


4, 48 LYON STREET TILBURY ON N0P2L0


 




Between:


Douglas Dawdy


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Rachelle Price


Tenant



 
 
 
Douglas Dawdy (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Rachelle Price (the 'Tenant') because
the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard by video
conference on December
20, 2021.
 
At 11:00 am the Landlord and the
Landlord’s Daughter Rebecca-Ann Dawdy attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations and Reasons:
 
1.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
2.    
This is a month-to-month tenancy in which rent is due on the first
of the month in the amount of $710.00.
 
3.     The rental unit is part of a four-plex and the tenant
has lived there since 2018.
 
4.     The Landlord’s L2 application filed on October 13,
2021 is based on a N12 notice of termination
served to the Tenant on October 4, 2021 with a termination date of December 31, 2021 pursuant to subsection
48(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).
 
5.    
Pursuant to s.72(1) of the Act, the Landlord
filed the declaration required stating that his
daughter intends to move into the rental unit for no less than one year.
 
6.    
Pursuant to s.48(1), the Landlord
compensated the Tenant in the amount equal to one month’s rent on December
30, 2021 by cheque
– a
copy of which was submitted to the Board.




 
7.    
The Landlord has
not, within two years prior to filing this application, given any other notice under section 48, 49 or 50 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the “Act”) in respect of the same or a different
rental unit.
 
8.    
It was the uncontested testimony of the Landlord that his daughter,
who currently resides with him, has recently graduated
university and it’s time to “spread her wings.” He said that area rent is high and he wants to help her get
established. She will be paying a
monthly rent of $500.00 which is comparable to the other tenants in the complex
which ranges for $595.00 to $710.00. He
also testified that his daughter will be providing care taking services for the
complex.
 
9.     The Landlord testified that he has owned the building
for 30 years and has never had reason to be before the Landlord and Tenant Board. He offered
all tenants in the building compensation to relocate and the
Tenant had initially agreed, then declined and did not attend the hearing to
defend his position.
 
10.  It was the uncontested testimony of the Landlord’s
Daughter that she wants to move out of her Dad’s home. She works in the insurance industry and has a hybrid home/ off
site office schedule. The rental
unit will allow her to have a home office.
She said she plans to live in the rental
unit for a few years to allow her to save to purchase her own property.
 
11. 
It was the position
of the Landlord that he is seeking
eviction for March 31, 2022 as he understands the challenges for finding
alternative housing.
 
Law and Analysis
 
12.  According to s.48(1)
of the Act:
 
A landlord may, by notice,
terminate a tenancy if the landlord in good faith requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation for a period
of at least one year by,
 
(a)    
the landlord;
(b)    
the landlord’s spouse;
(c)    
a
child or parent
of the landlord or the landlord’s spouse;
or
(d)    
a person who provides or will
provide care services to the landlord, the landlord’s spouse, or a child or
parent of the landlord or the landlord’s spouse, if the person receiving the
care services resides or will reside in the building, related group of
buildings, mobile home park or land lease community in which the rental unit is located.
 
13.  Based on the uncontested evidence
before the Board, I find that the Landlord’s Daughter genuinely intents to move into
the rental unit and use if for residential purposes. I also that the Landlord has met all the requirements under the
Act with respect to the N12 served pursuant to s.48(1).




 
14.  The Landlord testified
that the Tenant
lives alone and is retired.
 
15.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of
the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find
that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Landlord is
unaware of any circumstances that would justify relief from eviction.
 
16. 
This order contains all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
December 31, 2021. The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before March 31, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before March 31, 2022, then starting
April 1, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after April 1, 2022.
