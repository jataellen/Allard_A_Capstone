Stephanie Cook                                                                                                                  Tenant
 
 
Tuesday Arabejo and Cesar Arabejo
(the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Stephanie
Cook (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 24, 2022. Only the Landlords attended the hearing. As of 12:00 p.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period from May
1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords
served a Notice of Termination effective August 2,
2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,580.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,550.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from March 14, 2019 to August 2, 2021.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement with the




 
Tenant, and find that it would
be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 15, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $11,900.92*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 4, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $51.95
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 5, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $201.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing* on or before February 15, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 16,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 15, 2022, then starting
February 16, 2022, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 16, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 15, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $14,981.64** to the Landlords or to the Board in trust, this order for
eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time,
the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after February 16, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
