Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-11772-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


31 TOLLGATE STREET BRAMPTON ON L6Z0J2


 




Between:


The Brown Investors Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Particia Shantel Smith Yarida Soraima Hernandez


Tenants



 
 
 
The Brown
Investors Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Yarida Soraima Hernandez and Particia Shantel Smith (the 'Tenants')
because they have substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or
lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit
after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 16, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s Legal Representative, Atta Choudhry, attended
the hearing. As of 10:29 a.m., the Tenants were not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
On August 10, 2021, the
Landlord served the Tenants an N5 Notice of Termination (N5) with a termination
date of August 31, 2021. This was the first N5 notice served to the Tenants which allowed the Tenants to be able to void the N5 notice if they corrected their behaviour within 7 days of being served.
 
2.    
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is
$3,350.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $3,350.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from May 29, 2020 to
August 31, 2021.




 
 
 
6.    
The Landlord’s Legal Representative submitted
that the Tenants
are responsible for the
following:
(a)  March 8, 2021 – The Tenants were notified but failed to pay the utility bill.
(b)  April 5, 2021 – The Landlord
emailed the Tenants
notifying them of the nonpayment and the Tenants still failed to
pay.
(c)  April 22, 2021 –
Another utility bill was issued
and was not paid by the
Tenants.
(d)  June 3, 2021 – The Tenants
were in violation of municipal
by-laws regarding failing
to remove debris, junk, waste, derelict furniture, appliances, machinery
and household garbage from the rental property.
(e)  June 24, 2021 – The
Landlord received a notice from the lawyer of the condo corporation in relation to the garbage
left by the Tenants and the by-law
notices from the city. The Landlord
was fined for the Tenants’
violations in the amount of $678.00.
(f)   August 9, 2021 – The Landlord’s representative attended the rental unit and noticed that the Tenants’ property
maintenance was still in violation of the city by-law.
 
7.    
The Landlord’s Legal
Representative stated that due to the actions of the Tenants and the fact the Tenants
have not attempted
to rectify any of their behaviour, the Landlord is seeking to evict the Tenants.
 
Findings
 
8.    
On the balance of
probabilities, I find that the Tenants’ behaviour has substantially interfered
with Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment and lawful
rights regarding the rental
unit. I also find that the Tenants’
actions caused the Landlord to be fined by the condo
corporation which manages the property where the rental unit is located.
 
Relief From Eviction
 
9.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
10.  This order contains
all of the reasons in this matter
and no further reasons will be
issued.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated, as of January 17, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 17, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $10,633.55, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from September 1, 2021 to January 5, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit.




 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $110.14 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from January 6, 2022 to
the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before January 16, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 17, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January
18, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 18, 2022.
