In the matter
of:


112, 255 SIMCOE
STREET N OSHAWA ON L1G4T4


 




Between:


255 Simcoe Street
Holdings


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Sara Cowan


Tenant



 
 
255 Simcoe Street
Holdings (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Sara Cowan (the 'Tenant') of a superintendent’s premises, because the Tenant’s
employment as superintendent has ended.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on December 15, 2021. The Landlord’s legal agent,
K. Bucan,
the Landlord’s legal representative L. Thibert, and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
The Tenant declined the opportunity to speak with Tenant Duty Counsel.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant
was employed as a superintendent at the residential complex.
 
2.    
The Landlord
terminated the employment of the Tenant
on September 7, 2021. The Tenant
did not vacate the unit until November 12, 2021.
 
3.    
The Tenant
was still in possession of the rental unit as of the date the application was filed.
 
4.    
The Tenant
did not pay any rent to the Landlord.
 
5.    
The
Landlord was seeking daily compensation for the period that the Tenant
continued to occupy the unit after her employment had ended. This request is
denied.
 
6.    
Section 86 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’) states that a landlord
is entitled to compensation
for use and occupation after termination of a tenancy by order, notice or
agreement. The enforcement provision for compensation is in section
87(3). Section 87(3) allows a Landlord to apply for
compensation for use and occupation from a tenant who is still in possession
after termination of the tenancy by notice or agreement. However, a
superintendent's tenancy is not terminated by notice or agreement. The tenancy
is terminated by termination of the employment. An order pursuant to section 94
merely confirms the termination of the superintendent’s employment.

7.    
In sum, section 86 and
section 87(3) make it clear that compensation is only available where a tenancy
is terminated by notice or agreement, or by a Board order confirming
termination by notice or agreement.
Section 87(3) does not apply to a superintendent's tenancy. As a result, a
landlord cannot apply to the Board for compensation from an overholding tenant
after termination of a superintendent's tenancy.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and Tenant is terminated as of September 7, 2021, the date the Tenant’s employment ended.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before January 23, 2022, the
Tenant will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 24, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
