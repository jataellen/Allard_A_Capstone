Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-03311-21



In the matter
of:


UPPER, 140 COLLIER
STREET BARRIE ON L4M1H4


 




Between:


David Martel


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Ashley Donna Anne Green
  Derek James McColeman


Tenants



 
 
David Martel (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Derek James
McColeman and Ashley Donna Anne Green (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did
not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
This application was heard by
video conference on February 7, 2022. Only
the Landlord attended the hearing.
As of 11:15 a.m., the Tenants were not present
or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
October 12, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
3.    
The lawful monthly rent is $2,300.00.
4.    
The Tenants paid $5,500.00
after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,300.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with section 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact
of COVID-19 on the parties and
whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the
Tenants, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 5, 2022.




File Number: CEL-03311-21
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $5,964.86*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 22, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $75.62
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 23,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before March 5, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 6, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 5, 2022, then starting
March 6, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 6, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)   $8,986.00 if the payment is made on or before
February 28, 2022,
or
ii)   $11,286.00 if the payment is made on or before March 5, 2022**.
If the Tenants
do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March 6, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
February 22, 2022
