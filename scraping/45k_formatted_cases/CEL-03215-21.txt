Between:                  IMH Pool XX LP                                    Landlord
 
 
and
 
Yasir Abbasi                                                                                                                    Tenant
 
 
IMH Pool XX LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Yasir Abbasi (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard by videoconference on January 24, 2022.
Only the Landlord’s Legal
Representative, Sean Beard,
attended the hearing. As of 2:42 p.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this
hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the
Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
May 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October
29, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $2,188.00.
 
4.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,138.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 1, 2021 to October 29, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $8,552.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until February 28, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
While the Tenant was not present to request relief, I note that the Tenant has
made significant payments towards his. A postponement will allow time for the
Tenant to pay the amount required to void this order should he wish to remain
in the rental unit.
 
It is
ordered that:




File Number: CEL-03215-21
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.
 
2.    
As of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears
of rent and compensation the
Landlord is entitled to by
$1,668.75*.
 
3.     However, the Landlord
is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenant: $71.93 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit, and $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     The Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 28, 2022, then starting
March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
7.     If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$560.99 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022,
or
ii)             
$2,748.99 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full
payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.    
The Tenant may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after March
1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
