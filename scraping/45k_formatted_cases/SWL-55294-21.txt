Order under Section

Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55294-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


20, 51 WOOLLEY STREET CAMBRIDGE ON N1R5J7


 




Between:


Woodford Apartments Limited


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Stephanie Flader


Tenant



 
 
 
Woodford Apartments Limited (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Stephanie Flader (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 13, 2022. Only
the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Julian Shumka, attended the hearing. As of
10:56 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Preliminary matter:
 
The Landlord sold the
building after filing the application
but prior to the hearing taking place. The new Landlord took possession of the
rental complex on January 1, 2022. As a result, the application will only address
outstanding arrears to December 31, 2021
and not termination of the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from July 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because of the
arrears, the Landlord served a Notice
of Termination effective September 22, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,100.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.




File Number: SWL-55294-21
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent
deposit of $1,100.00 from the Tenant. As part of the sale this deposit
has been transferred to the new Landlord and will not be applied
against any amounts owing
here.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$6,600.00, which represents the amount of rent
owing up to December 31, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February
1, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 2, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
