Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-24363-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


707, 540 SHERBOURNE STREET TORONTO ON M4X1L2


 




Between:


Better Living
Homes Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Michael McCarthy
  Samuel Warren


Tenants



 
 
 
Better Living Homes Inc. (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Samuel Warren
and Michael McCarthy
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
12, 2022. The Landlord's Legal Representative, Bryan Rubin, and
the Tenant, Samuel Warren, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from June 1, 2021 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 18, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $
 
4.    
The Tenants have made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,400.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find
that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 15, 2022
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 15, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $9,290.18*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 19, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $46.03
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 20, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
15, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 16, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 15, 2022, then starting
February 16, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 16, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$11,386.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$12,786.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 15, 2022**.
If the Tenants
do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 16, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
January 19, 2022                                                                                 Date Issued                                                                       Richard
