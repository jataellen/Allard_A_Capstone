David Burrows


Tenant



 
 
 
2527457 Ontario Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
David Burrows (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 24, 2022.
Only the Landlord’s Agent,
Paolo Pambianchi, attended the hearing. As of 4:32 p.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
May 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
22, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
November 26, 2021. The Tenant
was in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,015.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,510.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 1, 2020 to September 22, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of November
26, 2021, the date the Tenant returned
vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.




File Number: HOL-12298-21
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $7,506.79*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to November
26, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
10, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 11, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
