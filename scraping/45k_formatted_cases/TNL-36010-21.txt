In the matter

  M6E2K5


 




Between:


Starlight Canadian Residential Growth Fund


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Yadira

Tenant



 
 
 
Starlight
Canadian Residential Growth Fund (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Yadira Hernandez Del Valle (the 'Tenant') and
for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because
the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order
issued by the Board on August 26, 2021 with respect to application
TNL-31821-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant
has not met the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $697.50 (arrears)
on or before October 15, 2021 and did not pay
the full monthly rent on or before November 1, 2021.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for
the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $3,600.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
TNL-31821-21. The amount
that is still owing from that
order is $1,246.50 and that amount is included in this order. As a result,
the previous order TNL-31821-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed
to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from November 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.




 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,688.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021 to January 5, 2022.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TNL-31821-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 16, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$3,210.30 (less any amount
paid to the Landlord
after the application was filed). This
amount represents the rent owing up to January 5, 2022 and the costs related to
the application fee for the previous application, less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$55.50 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 6, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
16, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January
17, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 17, 2022.

The tenant
has until January
15, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 15, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on July 17, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction
where the rental unit is located.
