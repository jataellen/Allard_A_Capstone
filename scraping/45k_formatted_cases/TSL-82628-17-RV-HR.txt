Order under Section 21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-82628-17-RV-HR
 










 
 

Review Order
 
P.T
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict P.P
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (L1
application)
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant has substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord (L2
application).
 
These
applications were resolved by order TSL-82628-17 issued on April 25, 2017.
 
On
October 20, 2017, the Landlord requested a review of the order as it concerned
the L1 application, and that the order be stayed until the request to review
the order is resolved. 
 
The
request for review was heard on November 23, 2017 and the request was granted
by order TSL-82628-17 issued on December 28, 2017 and the de novo
hearing on the L1 application was scheduled to another available date.
 
The
de novo hearings were heard in Toronto on March 15, 2018 and May 9,
2018.
 
On
March 15, 2018, the Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing. The
Landlord’s legal representative was D. C.  Managers from PC Financial, Mr. K
(PC), and CIBC, Mr. D (WD), gave evidence.
 
On
May 9, 2018, only the Landlord and his legal representative, D. C, attended the
hearing.  I was satisfied that the Tenant had received the Notice of Hearing. 
The Tenant had participated in the setting of the date for hearing and had been
accommodated for his regular medical appointments.  There was no request to
adjourn before me.  The Landlord advised that the Tenant had not made any of
the disclosure required in the interim order TSL-82628-17-IN2.  
Based
on this, I took the Landlord`s submissions at 9:45 am, but the Landlord and
Landlord representative waited until after 12 noon, to see if the Tenant would
attend and to reconvene the hearing.  The Tenant did not attend at the Board
office, or ever contact the Board by telephone or email to advise as to the
reason for his absence.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant testified in the original hearing on
April 19, 2017 that he had made two payments totalling $1,460.00 by cheques to the Landlord’s mother, and produced
copies of the cancelled cheques dated January 5, 2017 and February 5, 2017 as
well as his bank statement from Tangerine Chequing account showing that funds
for the two cheques came out of his account on February 1, 2017.  The cheques
were both made out to Katerina Tsiriotakis.  The Landlord denied receiving
these payments.
2.     
The Member determined that on the Tenant’s
“strong corrobative evidence” he had paid his rent for January and February
2017 and dismissed the application in order TSL-82628-17 issued on April 25,
2017.  
3.     
At the review hearing on November 23, 2017,
managers from Tangerine Bank testified that the Tenant’s cheques had been
deposited by photo remote deposit on-line to a President’s Choice Bank Account.
They advised that President’s Choice is operated by CIBC and that while they
had inquired, President’s Choice would not disclose the holder of the account. 
They also explained that the holder of the account was not necessarily the
individual to whom the cheque was made.  
4.     
On March 15, 2018, the witness WD, a manager at
Simpli Financial, testified that the two cheques drawn on the Tangerine account
of the Tenant for January and February rent were deposited in a Simpli
Financial account.  He further testified that Simpli Financial is a rebranding
of PC Financial, and that the direct banking services of Simpli Financial are
provided by CIBC.  He further testified that the account holder’s name is that
of the Tenant.  He had no further information to disclose concerning when the
account was opened or what information the bank held to identify the holder of
the account.  
5.     
On the basis of the uncontested testimony of the
Tangerine Bank and Simpli Financial managers, I make the following findings:  
a)      The
Tenant wrote cheques with the Landlord`s name on them, but deposited them to
his own account at PC Financial. Thus, the Tenant did not make the disputed
payments to the Landlord;
b)      The
Tenant testified as to the payments he had made to the Landlord and produced
the cheques and his Tangerine Chequing Account statement to Member Lang in the
hearing on April 25, 2017 in a deliberate attempt to mislead the Board as to
the rent paid to the Landlord.
6.     
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the
Tenant was required to pay for the period from January 1, 2017 to November 30,
2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective February 24, 2017.
7.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $730.00
from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
8.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenant for the period from April 5, 2016 to February 24, 2017.
9.     
The Tenant has paid $1,460.00 to the Board in
trust since the application was filed and this money was paid out to the Landlord
by order TSL-82628-17 issued on April 25, 2017.
10.  
The Landlord has asked for costs, considering
the extent of the costs incurred by the Landlord in proving the fraudulent act
of the Tenant, in the amount of $1,400.00.  As I read Rule 27.2 of the Landlord
Tenant Board Rules of Practice, a maximum of $700.00 can be awarded for the
proceeding.  I find that it is warranted in these circumstances by the
unreasonable conduct of the Tenant to award costs to the Landlord.  
11.  
The Landlord has also asked that Board costs in
the amount of $5,000.00 be levied against the Tenant, considering his conduct
in misrepresenting that rent had been paid when it had not.  The Landlord urges
that this would have a deterrent effect.
12.  
The Tenant’s actions have resulted in 3 days of
hearing beyond the initial application in which he misled the Member claiming
that rent had been paid when he knew it had not.  However, the Rule of Practice
27.2 also applies to Board costs, so I find that the maximum amount to be
awarded for the proceeding is $700.00 and that it is warranted in these
circumstances by the unreasonable conduct of the Tenant.  
13.  
This may also be a matter the Rental Housing
Enforcement Unit wishes to consider to determine if Tenant`s actions may
constitute an offence under the Act and should be prosecuted accordingly.  
14.  
I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Order TSL-82628-17 issued on April 25, 2017 is
cancelled and replaced by the following: 
2.     
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out
below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The
Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before June 3, 2018.
3.     
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $9,978.22*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to May 23, 2018,
less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $24.00
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting May 24, 2018 to the
date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
5.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
6.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord the
sum of $700.00 for costs.
7.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the
full amount owing* on or before June 3, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe
interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June 4, 2018 at 3.00%
annually on the balance outstanding.
8.     
The Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) immediately so that the eviction may be enforced
on or after June 4, 2018.
9.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord, on or after June 4, 2018.
10.  
If the Tenant wishes to void this order and
continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in
trust:
i)        $11,840.00 if the payment is made on or before May 31, 2018, or
ii)       $12,570.00 if the payment is made on or before June 3, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
11.  
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after June 4, 2018 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make
this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
12.  
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord Tenant
Board the sum of $700.00 for costs.  This sum must be paid on or before June 3,
2018.  If the sum is not paid, then interest will start to accrue on these
amounts at the rate of 3.00% per annum.
