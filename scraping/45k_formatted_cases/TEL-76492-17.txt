Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-76492-17
 










 
 

A.P.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict J.M.
and S.A. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
At
the hearing the Tenants applied pursuant to section 82 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') for an order determining that the Landlord
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or
residential complex by the Tenants or by a member of their household and failed
to meet the Landlord's maintenance obligations or failed to comply with health,
safety, housing or maintenance standards.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on March 1, 2017.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s representative, W.M., and the second-named
Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
L1
APPLICATION
1.     The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from October 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective January 4, 2017.
2.     The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $900.00 from the Tenants and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
3.     Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from August 1, 2016
to January 4, 2017.
4.     The
Landlord incurred costs of $170.00 for filing the application and entitled to
reimbursement of those costs. 
TENANTS’
SECTION 82 CLAIM
5.     The
Tenants raised the following issues pursuant to section 82 of the Act:
a)    The
Landlord did not comply with the property standards order as ordered by the
Board in TET-74011-16; and
b)    The
Landlord has turned off the Wi-Fi in the rental unit.
6.     The
Landlord showed second-named Tenant an email received by the Municipality which
states the work order referenced in the            Board’s order TET-74011-16
has been closed and is not outstanding.  The Tenant did not provide any
evidence to the contrary.  This item is dismissed.
7.     The
second-named Tenant claimed the Landlord frequently shut the Wi-Fi off during
their tenancy.  This item had been brought up and dismissed in order
TET-74011-16 dated December 20, 2016.  I notified the second-named Tenant that the
Board can only hear of dates after the order as the merits of the issue prior
to the order have been addressed.  
8.     The
second-named Tenant testified she makes approximately $450.00 a week working
from home.  She needs the Wi-Fi in order to complete her work.  The remedy she sought
was approximately $2,000.00.
9.     The
Tenant showed correspondence from the Landlord stating the Wi-Fi will be
discontinued.  The Landlord admits the Wi-Fi was discontinued about one week
prior to the hearing.  
10.  The
Tenant did not submit any other evidence to support her claim that the Wi-Fi
had been shut off.  
11.  With
respect to abatement of the rent, the Tenants led no evidence aside from a
vague statement that the second-named Tenant earns $450.00 a week from her
business; therefore, only a nominal abatement will be awarded which I fix at
$50.00.
12.  I have
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1)
of the Act.
13.  This
order contains all of the reasons for my decision within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.  
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before April 1, 2017.
2.     The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $4,111.39*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to March 21, 2017, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $29.59 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting March 22, 2017 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $170.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.     If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before April
1, 2017, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from April 2, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 1, 2017, then starting April 2,
2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 2, 2017.
8.     If
the Tenants wish to void this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)       $5,520.00 if the payment is made on or before March 31, 2017, or
ii)      $6,420.00 if the payment is made on or before April 1, 2017**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after April 2, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
