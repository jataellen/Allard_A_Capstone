Review Order
 
Casa Mia
Apartment Rentals (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict John Jack Felteau (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was resolved by order NOL-43582-21 issued on October
20, 2021. On November 3,
2021, the Tenant requested a review of the order.
The request
was heard by videoconference on January 21, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s representative J. Koopman,
the Tenant’s legal
representative K. Facca,
and the Tenant attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Review
 
1.     The Tenant testified that he did not attend the
hearing held on October 1, 2021 because he found out about this hearing in mid-October 2021. The Tenant
testified that he was not informed about the hearing prior to
the hearing date.
 
2.     In cross-examination
the Tenant was asked if he received any documents under his door in July 2021. He said he did
not. The question is irrelevant to whether the Tenant received the notice of
hearing, which was issued in September 2021. The Tenant was also asked if he
recalls a conversation with the Landlord’s representative in which the
representative said that the Landlord
would proceed with eviction. This question was also
irrelevant because the representative acknowledged that he did not tell the
Tenant the date and time of the hearing in that conversation.




 
 
 
3.    
The Landlord gave no evidence to
contradict the Tenant’s testimony. Based on the Tenant’s uncontested testimony, at the hearing
I found, on a balance
of probabilities, that the Tenant was unaware of the hearing
held October 1, 2021 until after it happened and so I found that the Tenant
was not reasonably able to participate
in the proceedings. The Landlord’s L1 application proceeded de novo.
 
L1 application
 
4.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
June 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective July 30,
2021.
 
5.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
6.     The monthly rent is
$995.00.
 
7.     The Tenant paid $2,700.00 after the application was filed.
 
8.    
The parties agree that the Tenant owes $4,250.00 in arrears of rent to January 31, 2022.
The Landlord paid $186.00 to file this application. The total owed, with the
fee, is
$4,436.00.
 
9.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find
that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
10.  The Tenant has two children but they do not live with
him. The Tenant testified that he had a substantial monthly income until June
2021, when he changed jobs and then was unable
to start his new job when he was incarcerated. Since then he has received
social assistance and a monthly income from a settlement. The Tenant
proposed a payment plan whereby he would pay off the arrears in 30 months. This
would be unfair to the Landlord. Based on the Tenant’s testimony about his income,
he can afford to pay his rent and a sufficient amount toward arrears to pay the
amount off in nine months. This payment plan is not unfair to the Landlord.
 
It is ordered that:
 
11.  Order NOL-43582-21 issued
on October 14, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the
following:
 
12.  The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4,436.00, which
represents the amount
of rent owing up to January
31, 2022 and the application fee.
 
13.  The Tenant
shall pay the amount owing and rent that comes due as follows:




 
a)     Commencing February 10, 2022,
and continuing until September 10, 2022,
the Tenant shall pay $500.00 to the Landlord on or before the 10th day of each month;
 
b)    
On or before October
10, 2022, the Tenant shall pay $436.00
to the Landlord; and
 
c)     
Commencing February 1, 2022 and
continuing until the full amount owing is paid
off, the Tenant
shall pay the monthly rent in full on or before the first day of each month.
 
14.  If the Tenant fails to make any one of the payments in
accordance with this order, the outstanding balance of any arrears of rent
and costs to be paid by the Tenant to the Landlord pursuant to paragraph 12 of this order shall become
immediately due and owing
and the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to the Board pursuant
to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenant and requiring that the Tenant pay any new arrears, NSF fees and related
charges that became owing after January 31, 2022. The Landlord must make this
application no later
than 30 days after
the Tenant’s failure
to make a payment.
