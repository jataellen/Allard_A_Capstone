In the matter
of:


1008, 3 GLAMORGAN AVENUE TORONTO ON M1P4N9


 




Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jane Booplai Susan
Booplai
Terrence
  Ramkisson


Tenants



 
 
 
Great World Properties Ltd. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Susan
Booplai, Terrence Ramkisson and Jane Booplai (the 'Tenants') and for an order
to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because
the Tenants failed
to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on December 15, 2021 with
respect to application TEL-19060- 21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I
find that the Tenants have not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The
Tenant did not pay $1000.00
arrears on or before December
22, 2021. The Tenant
did not pay $1350.29 rent on or before January 1, 2022. The Tenant did not pay
$1000.00 arrears
on or before January 15, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $2,507.53 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order TEL-19060-21. The amount that is still owing from that
order is $1,484.87 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order TEL-19060-21 is cancelled.




 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenants
have failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.
 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,350.29 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from March 1, 2020 to
January 28, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order TEL-19060-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 8, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$1,376.24*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to January 28, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the previous
application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$44.39 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 29, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
8, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 9,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 8, 2022, then starting
February 9, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 9, 2022.
