Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-02748-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


3 GREENHILLS SQUARE BRAMPTON ON L6S2J4


 




Between:


Edwin Mesa
  Myra Mesa


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Meagan
Smith


Tenant



 
 
 
Edwin Mesa and
Myra Mesa (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Meagan Smith (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
The hearing
was held by videoconference
on December 21, 2021. Only the Tenant,
and their Legal
Representative, Sarah Teal, attended the hearing. The Landlord was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this
hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
Since the Landlords did not
appear at the hearing to support their application, I find that this application has been abandoned.
 
 
Tenant’s Request
for Costs:
 
2.    
Based on the Tenant
submissions, which included a timeline of correspondence between the Landlord’s
legal representative and Tenant’s legal representative between the dates of
December 14 and December 19, 2021, I find there is no basis to award costs
against the Landlord. I further find it was it was clear the Landlord’s
representative informed the Tenant’s representative that the Landlord was not
pursuing the application as the arrears had been satisfied; an ARR was provided to that effect.
Under the circumstances, I do not find it was necessary for the Tenant’s
representative to attend the hearing and the
request for costs denied.
