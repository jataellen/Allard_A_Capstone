Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-54901-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


11, 18 WATER
STREET S CAMBRIDGE ON N1R3C5


 




Between:


Cypress Holdings (Ontario) Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Warren
Potentier


Tenant



 
 
 
Cypress Holdings (Ontario) Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict Warren Potentier (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 20, 2021. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Ken Sherman attended
the hearing. As of 10:20 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from August 1,
2021 to December 31, 2021. Because of
the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 18,
2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     
The lawful
monthly rent is $825.00.
 
4.     
The Tenant
has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.     
The Landlord
also informed the Tenant about the hearing.
 
6.     
The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $825.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
 
7.     
Interest on the rent
deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from December 1, 2020 to August
18, 2021.
 
8.     
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the
Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement




 
with the Tenant and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The
Landlord spoke with the Tenant on the necessity of a
repayment agreement. The Landlord’s attempts
at negotiating a repayment agreement were unsuccessful as the Tenant
made no payments after the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the
Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before January 18, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $3,513.66*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 7, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay
to the Landlord $27.12 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 8, 2022 to the date the
Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 18, 2022, the
Tenant will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January 19, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
January 19, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 18, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $5,136.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be
terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after January 19, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
