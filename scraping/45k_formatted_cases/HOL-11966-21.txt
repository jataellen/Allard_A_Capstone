  Mac Millan


Tenants



 
 
 
Kiran Kaur Bumra (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Nicole Jean Mac Millan and Nicholas Andrew Newman (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on December 15, 2021.
The Landlord’s legal representative, P. Bumra, and the Tenant, N. Mac Millan
(NM) attended the hearing. NM states she was
appearing on behalf
of N. A. Newman (NN).
NN was not present although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board. NM declined
the opportunity to speak with Tenant Duty Counsel
before the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
By way of background, this application involves
a claim for rent arrears
by a tenant against
subtenants. The authority that allows the tenant to bring this application is found in section
99 and section 59 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).
Section 99 states as follows:
 
The following provisions apply,
with necessary modifications, with respect to a tenant who has sublet a rental
unit, as if the tenant were the landlord and the subtenant were the tenant:
 
1.
Sections 59 to 69, 87, 89 and 148.
 
2.    
Section 59 allows a landlord to give a notice of termination to a tenant
if they fail to pay rent
lawfully owing under a tenancy agreement.
 
3.    
It was undisputed that
the parties entered into a subtenancy agreement for the period of May to August
2021. The subtenancy was supposed to end on August 31, 2021. The N4 notice was
served on August 23, 2021, during the subtenancy.




 
4.    
The Tenants have not paid the
total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to December
31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective September 7, 2021.
 
5.    
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
 
6.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,700.00.
 
7.    
The Landlord
is not holding a last month's rent deposit.
 
8.    
The Tenants
have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
9.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), including the impact of COVID-19 on the
parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenants, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
10.  Pursuant to section 83(6), I am required to
consider whether the Landlord made attempts to negotiate a payment agreement
with the Tenants. The Landlord submitted that five or six payment plans were
presented to the Tenants. The Tenants did not dispute that a payment plan was
presented. I am satisfied that the Landlord attempted to negotiate a payment
agreement with the Tenants.
 
11.  With respect to section 83(2), the Tenants submitted that the reason
that they did not pay rent in full and on time was because NN got into a car accident in January 2021. They were supposed to receive insurance money,
but they had not yet received it. Further, NM is on ODSP. They have a
five-year-old daughter who they enrolled in school in the area. NM stated that
they have been making efforts to look for units since the end of August, when
the subtenancy ceased, but have been unsuccessful. When asked how much time
they needed to vacate, NM stated that they need at least two months.
 
12.  The Landlord submitted that she has been
severely impacted by the Tenants arrears and continued occupancy. The Landlord
had to get a part-time job to maintain
the tenancy and had to give up an internship at her
university as a result. She can no longer pay for the Tenants’ arrears and has
since received an N4 from the main landlord.
 
13.  The prejudice to the Landlord
in granting relief
from eviction outweighs the prejudice to the
Tenants. It would be unfair
to the Landlord to continue
to forego opportunities because the Tenants refused
to vacate at the end of the subtenancy or pay any rent. Further,
it is unclear what benefit would come from an additional two months of relief when NM’s testimony
was that they have been looking for alternative housing since August
2021. As such, the Tenants’ request for relief is denied.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental
unit on or before January 25, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $11,001.04*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 14, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $55.89 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 15, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 25, 2022, the
Tenants will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 25, 2022, then starting January 26, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
January 26, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 25, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $12,086.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after
January 26, 2022 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
