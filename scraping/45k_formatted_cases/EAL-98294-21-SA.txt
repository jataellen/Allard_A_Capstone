Tenants




 
 
 
Starlight Cdn Residential Growth
Fund 2 (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Paul Wensing and Tammy Ball (the
'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified
in the mediated settlement issued by the Board
on August 17, 2021 with respect to application EAL- 95473-21.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved by order EAL-98294-21, issued on November
17, 2021. The Tenants filed a
motion to set aside order EAL-98294-21.
 
This motion was heard by video conference on January 21, 2022, beginning at 9:00 a.m..
 
Only the Tenants attended the
hearing. As of 10:10 a.m., the Landlord was not present or represented at this hearing
although properly served
with a notice of the hearing by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The mediated settlement provided
that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants did not meet
certain condition(s) specified in the settlement.
 
2.       
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting mediated settlement required
the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of
the arrears of rent.
 
3.       
The amount that is still owing,
according to the terms of the mediated settlement, for arrears of rent, and the costs related to the application fee for the previous application is
$5,171.72.




 
4.       
Since the date of the mediated
settlement, the Tenants
have failed to pay the full
rent that became owing for October
1, 2021. The Tenant T.B. testified that she only became aware that the amount had not be processed
when she received the exparte order.
 
5.       
The Tenants request further time
to pay the arrears. T.B. has been employed since August 2021 and has passed her probationary period.
The Tenant P.W. is not employed.
T.B. works from home and
is on the telephone throughout the day. She is paid wages per call. She testified that she has lost
wages because of the noise of construction that is occurring within the
residential complex, as it interferes with her ability to make clear,
professional calls.
 
6.       
T.B. is seeking financial assistance within the community with respect to the arrears,
and she anticipates receiving a refund on her taxes.
 
7.       
The Tenants seek an order granting
them further time to pay the arrears
in full, to March
31, 2022. The Tenants believe that
the outstanding arrears are $4,300.00. However, no evidence was provided to
support this position.
 
8.       
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until March 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
9.       
The Tenants remain entitled
to bring their own applications to the Board regarding issues within the tenancy.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
Order EAL-98294-21, issued on November 17, 2021 is set aside.
Order EAL-95473-21, issued on
August 17, 2021 is varied, as follows.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before March 31, 2022.
 
3.       
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $3,637.83*. This amount represents the rent owing up to February 1, 2022 and the costs
related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$37.50 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting February 2, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.       
If the Tenants do not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March 31, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from April 1, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 31, 2022, then starting April 1, 2022,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.




 
7.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after April 1, 2022.
