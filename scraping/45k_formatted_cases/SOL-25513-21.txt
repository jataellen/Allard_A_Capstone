In the
  matter of:


1907, 20 EMERALD STREET
N HAMILTON ON L8L8A4


 




Between:


DMS Property Management Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Karter Hosford-Pelchat Natasha Pelchat Serenity Langille-Pelchat


Tenants



 
 
 
 
 
DMS Property Management Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Karter Hosford-Pelchat,
Serenity Langille-Pelchat and Natasha Pelchat (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 8, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative,
Frank Calcagni, attended the hearing. As of 10:26 a.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 21, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
As of January 1, 2022, the monthly rent is $991.00.
 
4.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $991.00
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from December
2, 2020 to January 21, 2022.




File Number: SOL-25513-21
 
6.    
The Tenants paid $3,620.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenants, and find that it would
not be unfair to postpone
the eviction until March 31, 2022
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 31, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $53.03*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
14, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$32.58 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 15, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before March 31, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from April 1, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before March 31, 2022, then starting April
1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 1, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)          
$1,746.90 if the payment is made on or before February 28, 2022, or
ii)         
$2,737.90 if the payment is made on or before
March 31, 2022**.
If the
Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 26, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The




File Number: SOL-25513-21
 
Tenants are only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
