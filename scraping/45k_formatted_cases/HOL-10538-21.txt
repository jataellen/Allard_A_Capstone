Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Alanna
Rabley


Tenant



 
 
 
Saadia Saifuddin (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Alanna Rabley (the 'Tenant') because
 
•        
The Tenant,
another occupant of the rental
unit or someone the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or
negligently caused undue damage to the premises.
•        
The Tenant,
another occupant of the rental
unit or someone the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex
has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of
the Landlord or another tenant;
•        
The Tenant,
another occupant of the rental
unit or a person the Tenant permitted in the residential
complex has seriously impaired the safety of any person.
 
The Landlord
has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage
 
This application was heard
by way of video conference on November 9, 2021. The Landlord
attended the hearing and was represented by George Berger,
Paralegal. As of 10:30am
the Tenant was not present.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
The Landlord’s application for termination of the tenancy
is based on a
N5 and N7 notice served to
the Tenant on March 5, 2021 with a termination date of March 27, 2021. The Landlord’s application also claims damages pursuant to section 89 (1) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the Act).
 
2.   
The Tenant
was in possession of the rental unit when the application was filed but vacated
on May 29, 2021. As such, I will only
be considering the Landlord’s claim for compensation for damages.




 
3.   
Section 89(1)(a)
of the Act states.
 
89 (1) A landlord
may apply to the Board for an order requiring
a tenant or former tenant to pay reasonable costs that the
landlord has incurred or will incur for the repair of or, where repairing is
not reasonable, the replacement of damaged property if,
 
(a)    
while the tenant or former tenant is or was in possession of the rental
unit, the tenant or former
tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person permitted
 
4.   
The rental
unit is located within a condominium complex.
The Landlord owns the single unit.
 
5.   
The Landlord’s application claims a total of $6,474.50 in damages to the
floors of the rental unit and
changing the locks on the front door of the rental unit.
 
6.   
At the hearing the Landlord’s legal representative stated that the Landlord is now seeking
$17,165.66 in compensation for damages and that additional damages were discovered when the Tenant vacated the
rental unit.
 
7.   
Rule 15 of the Board’s rules of procedure
speak to the amendment of applications and state in part:
 
15.1.   A request to amend an application before
the hearing must be.
 
a.        
In writing
b.        
served with the amended
application to all other parties;
and
c.         
filed with LTB with the amended application and a completed Certificate of Service.
 
8.   
Based
on the evidence before the Board, the Landlord did not file a request to amend
the L2 application prior to the hearing, nor did they serve any amended
application on the Tenant prior to the hearing. As the Landlord did not comply with Rule 15.1, I denied the
Landlord’s request to amend the application at the hearing
and as such, only proceeded
to hear the Landlord’s claim for $6,474.50 and the alleged damages to
the floors and front door lock of the rental unit.
Landlord’s uncontested evidence:
Front Door Lock:
9.   
The
Landlord testified that the Tenant changed the lock to the front entrance door
to the rental unit without
providing the Landlord with a copy of a replacement key and without
the consent of the Landlord or the Condo Corp. The Landlord was advised of this incident by the Condo Corp. on
February 25, 2021.




 
10.
The Landlord
testified by changing
the locks, the Condo Corp. did not have access
to the rental unit in cases
of an emergency as the master key would not work on the new lock.
 
11.
The Landlord
testified that they had to pay $186.45
to replace the locks on the front door of the rental unit. The Landlord entered into evidence a copy of the invoice paid to
a locksmith (LL exhibit #1).
 
Damage to Floors:
 
12.
The Landlord
testified that on February 12, 2021 the Landlord was contacted by the Condo Corp. that the Tenant’s washing
machine had leaked and overflowed causing damage to the floors of the rental
unit.
 
13.
The Landlord
submitted into evidence
a copy of an invoice
showing that the Landlord had to pay $8,390.83 to replace the
floors of the rental unit (LL exhibit #2). When
asked why the costs to repair the floors was more than claimed on the L2
application, the Landlord advised that when filing the L2 application, the
costs claimed was an estimate only and that when the repairs were conducted,
the costs turned out to be more than claimed.
Analysis:
 
14.
Section 35 of the Act
states:
 
35 (1) A tenant shall not alter the locking system
on a door giving entry to a rental unit or
residential complex or cause the locking system to be altered during the
tenant’s occupancy of the rental unit without the consent of the landlord.
 
(2) If a tenant alters a
locking system, contrary to subsection (1), the landlord may apply to the Board
for an order determining that the tenant
has altered the locking
system on a door giving entry to the rental unit or the residential complex or
caused the locking system to be altered during the tenant’s occupancy of the
rental unit without the consent of the landlord.
 
15.
The evidence
before the Board is clear that the Landlord has filed a L2 application alleging willful or negligent damages. The Landlord did not file a L8 application with the Board.
 
16.
I find
that the Landlord is not entitled to claim the costs of replacing the lock on
the front door of the rental unit as the Landlord did not file a L8 application under section 35(2), but
rather an L2 application under section 89 of the Act alleging undue damages. I also find that the Tenant changing the
locks without the Landlord’s consent does not constitute undue damages.




 
17.
Based
on the evidence before the Board, I am satisfied that the Tenant has
negligently caused undue damages to the floor of the rental unit by allowing
the washing machine to overflow and leak in the rental unit. I am further satisfied that the Landlord
had to pay out of pocket expenses to replace the damaged floors. The Tenant was not present at the hearing to challenge the Landlord’s evidence
and the Landlord
was consistent and credible
in her testimony. The Landlord’s
testimony was further supported by documentary evidence.
 
18. I find that
the Landlord is entitled to reimbursement of reasonable out of pock expenses in the amount of $5,932.50, which is the claimed costs to repair
the floors as plead on the L2 application. Although the Landlord
has provided evidence
that the total costs to repair the floors were $8,390.83, the Landlord
did not file an amended L2 application and as such, I find it would be unfair
to order the Tenant to pay more than what was claimed on the application.
 
19. The Tenant will also be ordered to pay the Landlord’s $201.00
application filing fee.
 
20.
This Order contains all the reasons
for this matter.
No further reasons
will issue.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated, as of May 29, 2021 the date the Tenant gave vacant possession
to the Landlord.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$5,932.50, which represents the reasonable costs of replacing the damaged property
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before January
26, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 27, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
