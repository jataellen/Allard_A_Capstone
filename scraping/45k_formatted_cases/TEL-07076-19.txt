Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-07076-19
 










 
 
 

N.A.R.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict (CS),
and (NW) (the 'Tenants') and (KW) because the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard in Peterborough on January 23, 2020.
 
The Landlord’s representative, K.A. and second-named Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      It
is undisputed that: KW, who was the father of NW, died on October 21, 2019. As
KW was not in possession of the unit on November 21, 2019 when the application
was filed, I amended the application to remove him as a tenant. 
 
It is
also undisputed that: the tenancy started on July 1, 2019; the monthly rent is
$1,520.00; the Tenants have not paid $4,539,95 of the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from November 1, 2019 to January 31, 2020; from
the month November  2019 to January 2020, inclusive, the Tenants paid $20.05 in
rent; because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective November 25, 2019; the Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,520.00
from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord; and
interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from June
29, 2019 to November 25, 2019.
 
2.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
3.      NW
testified that while her monthly ODSP benefit had historically been $1,642.00, her
shelter allowance was canceled from November 2019 onwards, reducing her total
monthly benefit to $900.00. This is because the Tenant lived in her sister’s
home for an undisclosed period after KW’s death to support the Tenant through
the grieving process. However, the sister failed to disclosure to ODSP that she
charged rent to the Tenant for this period. 
 
4.      From
this testimony I deduced that the Tennant asserts that ODSP discounted her housing
allowance under the misunderstanding that her housing costs discontinued
effective November.
 
5.      NW
testified that she did not become aware of this change in a timely way because,
perhaps through the effects of Alzheimer’s Disease, KW had forgotten to follow
through on his commitment to notify ODSP when the Tenants moved from their
prior city of residence to the present one, where ODSP is administered through
a different office.
 
6.      The
Tenant requested a payment plan, whereby, starting February 1, 2020, she would
pay $782.00 toward the outstanding balance until it was satisfied, as well as
the monthly rent.
 
7.      The
Tenant testified that her monthly expenses, inclusive of her phone, hydro,
toiletries and internet is $200.00.
 
8.      Both
KA and I expressed skepticism of the proposal’s viability, given that it would
leave the Tenant with almost no disposable monthly income. 
 
9.      In
response, the Tenant testified that she had made an arrangement with her
brother,  (BW), to move in effective February 1, 2020, and make up any short
fall in rent payments.
 
10.   BW
testified in corroboration of this arrangement, whereby he will contribute $760.00
monthly, and more as needed, from his monthly ODSP payment of $1,170.00. 
 
11.   KA
opposed the proposal, given that, in this young tenancy, the Tenants have paid
only $20.05 in rent in three months. Further, KA was doubtful that ODSP would continue
paying a housing allowance benefit to BW were he move into the unit other than
as a tenant. Given the amount of the arrears, it is unlikely that the Landlord
would agree to amend the lease to add BW as a tenant.
 
12.   I
shared some of KA’s concerns. However, KA’s speculative skepticism about BW’s
future benefit notwithstanding, if put into action, the Tenant’s aggressive
proposal would resolve the arrears in a very timely way. I was also mindful of
NW’s tragic personal circumstances that arose on the cusp the arrears. As such,
I orally ruled in favour of the proposal, at which time KA confirmed that
starting February 1, 2020 and continuing on the first day of each month, the
Tenants will pay $782.00 towards the outstanding balance, as well the monthly
rent, until the outstanding balance is satisfied. NW also confirmed that the
Tenants understand that If
they fail to make any of these payments, the Landlord may apply under section
78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 for an order terminating the
tenancy and evicting the Tenants. 
It is
ordered that:
1.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $4,714.95 for arrears of rent up to January 31, 2020, and costs.
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord the amount set out above in paragraph 1 in accordance with the
following schedule: 
a)    $782.00 on or before February 1, 2020;
b)    $782.00 on or before March 1, 2020;
c)    $782.00 on or before April 1, 2020;
d)    $782.00 on or before May 1, 2020;
e)    $782.00 on or before June 1, 2020; and
f)    
$22.95 on or before July 1, 2020.
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord the monthly rent on or before the first day of every month beginning February
1, 2020 until July 1, 2020. 
4.    
 If the Tenant fails to make any
one of the payments in accordance with this order, the outstanding balance of
any arrears of rent and costs to be paid by the Tenant to the Landlord pursuant
to paragraph 1 of this order shall become immediately due and owing and the
Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to the Board pursuant to
section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenant and requiring that the Tenant pay any new arrears, NSF fees and related
charges that became owing after January 31, 2020.
