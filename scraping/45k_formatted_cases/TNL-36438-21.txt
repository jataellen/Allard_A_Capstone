Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-36438-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1904, 10 SAN ROMANOWAY
  TORONTO ON M3N2Y2


 




Between:


Rpms Property Management Services Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Shantae
Bailey


Tenant



 
 
 
Rpms Property
Management Services Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Shantae Bailey (the 'Tenant')
and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent
the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the
order issued by the Board on October 18, 2021 with respect to application
TNL-33382-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant
has not met the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $400.00 arrears
on or before November 20, 2021. The Tenant did not pay $1560.00 rent on or before
December 1, 2021.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $6,451.00 for rent arrears and NSF cheque charges and the costs related
to the Landlord's application fee in Order TNL-33382-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $4,491.00 and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous order TNL-33382-21 is
cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed
to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from November 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.




File Number: TNL-36438-21
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TNL-33382-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 28, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $8,482.89*. This amount represents the rent owing up to
January 17, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the previous application.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $51.29
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 18, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 29, 2022.

The tenant has until January 27, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 27, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
