Amended Order
 
This order is amended to correct a clerical
error in the amount of arrears the Tenant owes to the Landlord and to give the Tenant
11 days to pay from the date of the amended order. The changes are bolded below. No
other changes have been made.
 
Brittany Zeglen (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Matthew James (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 18, 2022. Only the Landlord attended the hearing. As of 10:23 a.m.,
the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
February 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
30, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
November 2, 2022. The Tenant was in possession
of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.    
The lawful monthly rent was $1,700.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,700.00 from the
Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period from December
11, 2019 to September 30,
2021.
