Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44687-22
 



In the
  matter of:


A, 565 HURON STREET SUDBURY ON P3C2R2


 




Between:


Shawn
  Morrison


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Roger Kenneth Marcel
Blais Trysten Cory Gagne


Tenants



 
On January 18, 2022, Shawn
Morrison (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Trysten
Cory Gagne and Roger Kenneth
Marcel Blais (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants entered into an
agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord and the Tenants
signed an agreement
to terminate the tenancy as of
February 28, 2022.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenants to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 28, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 1, 2022.

The tenant has until February 10, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 77(6) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by February 10, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.
