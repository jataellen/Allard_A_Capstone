Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24933-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1, 62 CEDAR
STREET GUELPH ON N1G1C5


 




Between:


Carere Bridge
Enterprises


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Pula Mathumo


Tenant



 
 
 
Carere Bridge Enterprises (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Pula Mathumo (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 11, 2022.
Only the Landlord’s agent,
Ashley Cameron (AC), attended the hearing. As of 2:22pm, the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
July 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
22, 2021.
 
2.     After consideration of the submissions of AC with
respect to the Tenant’s possession of the rental unit as well as review of
Board order SOL-23338-21-SA dated December 07, 2021, I find on a balance
of probabilities the Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
November 2, 2021.
 
3.     At the hearing of the Tenant’s motion to set aside
Board order SOL-23338-21 on November 19, 2021, the Tenant testified he vacated
the rental unit on November 02, 2021. As Member
Morris was satisfied the Tenant had in fact vacated the rental unit on
that date, the matter was deemed moot and the Tenant withdrew their motion. In
order SOL-23338-21-SA dated December 07, 2021
the Member denied the motion and lifted the stay of the original
order.
 
4.     The monthly rent is $1,339.00.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.




File Number: SOL-24933-21
 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,399.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 25, 2021 to September 22, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of
November 2, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant possession of the rental unit to
the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $6,442.45*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to November
2, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
