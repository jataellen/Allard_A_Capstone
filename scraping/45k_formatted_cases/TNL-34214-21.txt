Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-34214-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


BASEMENT RM#2, 44 DASHWOOD CRESCENT ETOBICOKE ON M9V2N8


 




Between:


Moise Jones


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Natasha
Green


Tenant



 
 
 
Moise Jones (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Natasha
Green (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord attended
the hearing. The Landlord
was represented by Lisa Barder and called as a witness: Heritier Bajikila
Kankonda (the ‘Landlord’s Son’).
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
For the reasons that follow I find that the Landlord
in good faith requires possession of the
rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation by the Landlord’s Son.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s Son has
been doing caretaking work for the Landlord at the residential complex. The
intent of the Landlord and his Son is that one day the residential complex will
pass to the Son. The Landlord’s Son wants to move into the rental unit because
he currently lives in another city but does not drive. His regular job is also
close to the residential complex so moving to the rental
unit would be very convenient for both his job
and doing work around the complex. His intent is to live there indefinitely.
 
3.    
The rental
unit is a room with shared kitchen
facilities as is the home where the Landlord’s Son lives now so there will
be no change in that regard.
 
4.    
Finally, the Landlord’s Son is a single parent
as is one other tenant
in the residential complex. The Landlord’s Son has already discussed
with the other tenant what will happen when the children visit.




 
5.    
Given all of the evidence before me I am satisfied that the Landlord’s Son genuinely intends
to move into the rental unit to live there for more than one year.
 
6.    
The Landlord
paid the Tenant
compensation equal to one month's
rent on July 30, 2021.
 
7.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
and find that it
would be unfair to refuse eviction outright but it would not
be unfair to postpone the eviction until January 31, 2022 pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. I say this for the following reasons.
 
8.    
The Landlord’s Son is
currently housed so delaying eviction until January 31, 2022 will not cause any
serious adverse impact on the Landlord or the Landlord’s Son. But the Landlord
says the Tenant has lived in the rental unit for 7 to 8 years, pays $550.00 a
month in rent, is in receipt of social assistance from Ontario Works,
and told the Landlord
she has been looking for a new place to live.
 
9.    
Given the length of the
tenancy, the amount of the rent charged for the rental unit, the Tenant’s limited
income and the current pandemic
conditions, it seems to me that it would
not be unfair to the Landlord to delay the eviction until January 31, 2022 to
give the Tenant additional time to find a new home. An order shall issue
accordingly.
 
10.  The application seeks daily compensation but as of the date of hearing
before the Board no daily compensation is owing. The
Landlord therefore withdrew the request for compensation.
 
11.  The Landlord incurred costs of $186.00 for
filing the application and is entitled to reimbursement of those costs.
The application was not filed until after
the Tenant failed
to move out pursuant to the notice of termination, so the Landlord had
no option but to file this application and is therefore entitled to his costs.
 
12.  This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated as of July 31, 2021
pursuant to the Landlord’s notice of termination in Form N12.
 
2.    
The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before January
31, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before January
16, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.




 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January
31, 2022, then starting February
1, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 1, 2022.
