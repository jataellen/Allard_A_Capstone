Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-35201-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


603, 470
  SENTINEL ROAD NORTH YORK ON
  M3J1V6


 




Between:


Ranee Management


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Adeyemi Foluke Aramide


Tenant



 
 
 
Ranee Management (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Adeyemi Foluke
Aramide (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on January 31, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Ilana
Glickman attended the hearing. As of
10:18 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the
Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period from May 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective July 26, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     
The lawful monthly rent is $1,058.88.
 
4.      The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,058.88 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021
to July 26, 2021.
 
6.      The Tenant paid $4,900.00 after the application was filed.

7.     
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact
of COVID-19 on the parties
and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the
Tenant and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until
April 30, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
April 30, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,987.56*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
11, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $34.81
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 12, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before April 30, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from May 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
April 30, 2022, then starting
May 1, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 1, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes
to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$2,636.96 if the payment
is made on or before February 28, 2022, or
ii)             
$3,695.84 if the payment
is made on or before
March 31, 2022, or
iii)            
$4,754.72 if the payment
is made on or before
April 30, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.

9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after May 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenant is only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
