Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006

In the
  matter of:


3162 DOUGLAS STREET CAMLACHIE ON N0N1E0


 




Between:


Holliby Ross


Tenant




 


 
and


 




 


Joan Ross


Landlord



 
 
 
Holliby Ross (the 'Tenant')
applied for an order determining that Joan Ross (the 'Landlord') harassed, obstructed, coerced,
threatened or interfered with the Tenant.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on November 15, 2021.
 
The Tenant’s
Legal Representative Erli Bregu, the Tenant, the Landlord’s Legal Representative
Stephanie Sutherland and the Landlord attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant’s
request to amend the application is granted on the consent
of the Landlord.
 
2.    
The Tenant’s amended
application alleges that the Landlord harassed, coerced, obstructed, threatened
or interfered with the Tenant. Specifically,
the issue that the Board was asked to determine is if there was a new tenancy
agreement between the parties that commenced September 1, 2020,
or was it a continuation of an old tenancy,
and did the Landlord harass, coerce or interfere with the Tenant by terminating
this agreement.
 
Evidence
 
3.    
It was uncontested that the parties
entered into a verbal agreement that the Tenant
would have possession of the rental unit commencing November 30, 2019. The Tenant moved in early, on November 17,
2019.
 
4.    
It was uncontested that this was a fixed term agreement that would end on June 30,
2021. This was subsequently amended
to July 3, 2020.
 
5.    
The lawful monthly rent
was $2,000.00. The Tenant paid
$1,500.00 while a permitted occupant paid the additional $500.00.
In addition, the Tenant paid for electricity and wifi.




 
6.    
It was uncontested that the Tenant
agreed that she would vacate
on or before July 3, 2020 as the Landlord was operating an
AirBNB for July and August.
 
7.    
However, any agreement
to end the tenancy on a specified date is void and unenforceable if it was entered into at the beginning of the tenancy
or was a condition of the tenancy:
37(4) A tenant’s
notice to terminate a tenancy is void if it is given,
 
(a)         
at the time the tenancy agreement is entered into; or
 
(b)       as a condition
of entering into the tenancy
agreement.
8.    
The Tenant
vacated the rental
unit on July 3, 2020.
 
9.    
Over the course of the Tenancy,
the parties entered
into negotiations for alternative
accommodations at the Landlord’s residence and employment as a cleaner for the
AirBNB. In the end, these
negotiations did not lead to an agreement.
 
10.  The Tenant was permitted to store possessions in the garage at the rental unit after she vacated, as guests of the AirBNB did
not need access to the garage.
 
11.  Upon the Tenant moving out of the rental
unit on July 3, 2020, the Landlord discovered that the rental unit was not in a
state suitable for AirBNB guests. The
Landlord demanded the Tenant
pay for the clean-up and damages, or that her possessions would be disposed of otherwise. Eventually the Tenant was able to reclaim
her possessions and did not pay any damages to the Landlord.
 
12.  Over the course of the Tenancy, the parties had entered into negotiations for a new Tenancy that would commence on
September 1, 2020.
 
13.  The Tenant testified that she firmly believed
that they had reached terms for her to move back into the rental
unit commencing September
1, 2020. The Tenant had permission to store her possessions in the garage
and could leave some furniture in the house as it added to the AirBNB
home comforts. The Tenant provided
text messages from June 17, and 18, 2020 to show the extent of
the negotiations. The text messages
reveal that the parties agreed that the monthly rent would be $1,500.00 and
provided that the Tenant undertake certain renovations, a list of which had
been drawn up by the Landlord. In
addition, the Tenant produced a text message
dated June 17, 2020, at 5:30 pm, from the Landlord in which the Landlord was
seeking permission to delay the commencement of the Tenancy from September 1,
2020 to October 1, 2020 as the AirBNB business was picking up.
 
14.  The Landlord produced an email dated
Saturday July 4, 2020 at 8:43 PM. In
this email, the Landlord clearly
states: “There will be no returning to rent my house at 3162 Douglas St. and I will not be giving you
the cleaning job for the summer months if this is the way you clean.”




 
15.  The Landlord testified that there was no
agreement for a new tenancy. She
submitted that the discussions were just that, more like throwing out suggestions, and that nothing was fact for sure. It was as she
described it “very hazy nothing more than chatter”.
 
16.  The Tenant was not given possession of the rental
unit in September or October.
 
Issue before
the Board
 
17.  What the parties
are asking the Board to determine is whether:
 
a.   
The tenancy
was continuous (except
for the period from July 3 2020 to August
31, 2020, when the Landlord rented out the unit through AirBNB ), or
 
b.   
The parties
entered into a new verbal Tenancy agreement
that would commence September 1, 2020.
 
18.  The Tenant gave vacant possession of the
rental unit to the Landlord on July 3, 2020. The act of vacating the rental
unit terminated the tenancy effective on July 3, 2020. As the Tenant
vacated the rental unit, section
38 of the Act, which provides that a fixed term
tenancy is deemed to be renewed if it is not terminated, does not apply here.
 
19.  Further, section 5 (a) of the Act provides
that the Act does not apply to living accommodation intended for the travelling or vacationing public.
In this regard the period from July 3, 2020 to August 31,
2020 the Landlord operated an AirBNB and as such the Act would not apply.
 
20.  Thus, I am satisfied that the original
tenancy ended on July 3, 2020, when vacant possession was returned to the Landlord. Therefore, the tenancy
was not continuous.
 
21.  With respect to the issue
of whether the parties entered
into an oral agreement for a new tenancy to start on September 1,
2020, I preferred the testimony of the Tenant.
The Tenant was firm and unwavering in her belief that she would be
returning in September 2020 (or October 2020 as amended) and that the terms had
been agreed upon. The Tenant’s
testimony was supported by the emails and text messages provided.
 
22.  Conversely, I found the Landlord to be
evasive in responding to questions regarding the negotiations and that she
could not explain the emails and texts. She admitted that she does not use
written lease agreements, however for this Tenant she testified that anything would be in writing. This contradicted her previous practice
with this Tenant
and her admitted practices in the past.
 
23.  As such I am satisfied that at some point
prior to June 17, 2020, the parties reached a meeting of the minds, for a
tenancy to commence as of September 1, 2020 with a monthly rent of $1,500.00. This finding is supported by the
undisputed fact that on June 17, 2020, the Landlord attempted to negotiate a delay in the start date of the new tenancy
and that on July 4, 2020, the Landlord repudiated the tenancy by the Tenant
stating that the Tenant could not come back .




 
Analysis
 
24.  I have found that there was a new tenancy
agreement, and that the evidence demonstrates that the Landlord repudiated this
agreement on July 4, 2020 when she wrote to the Tenant to say she would not be
allowed to return to the house. I
make no findings on the job offer or loss of job offer, or the offer and
withdrawal of offer to reside in the Landlord’s residence over the summer,
however these imply a
certain element of retaliation on the part of the Landlord, as set out in her
July 4, 2020 email noted above.
 
25.  The problem that arises is that the conduct
occurred during a period where the Tenant was not a Tenant but a “prospective tenant”,
and as such s. 23 of the Act
does not apply under these circumstances.
 
26.  There were threats
made regarding damages
to be paid for which the Landlord
would then permit the Tenant to recover her possessions. This was resolved without the demanded
payment having been made.
 
27. 
In all of the circumstances, I am unable to award
any of the remedies that the
Tenant is claiming. There being no jurisdiction to do so, as the
Tenancy had ended, and as far as the new Tenancy,
she was a prospective tenant and the Act does not provide
a remedy to prospective
tenants when the Landlord repudiates the tenancy.
 
28.  The Tenant also asked that the Board
issue a fine to the
Landlord.
 
29.  The Board’s Interpretive Guideline 16
Administrative Fines sets out that administrative fines are a remedy to be used to encourage compliance with
the Act and deter Landlords from
engaging in similar conduct in the future. I
am not convinced that an administrative fine would serve those purposes in this
application. The Landlord would be
better advised to adopt formal written
tenancy agreements to avoid these problems in the future and an administrative fine would
not encourage the Landlord to do that; or put another way an administrative fine would not
discourage oral agreements. The
absence of formal written agreements is likely to lead to further allegations
from other tenants.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Tenant’s
application is dismissed.
