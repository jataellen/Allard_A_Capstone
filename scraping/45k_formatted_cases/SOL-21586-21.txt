Tenants



 
Grant McArthur
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Rachel Churchill and Chris Churchill
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 14, 2021. Only the Landlord
attended the hearing. As of 10:02 a.m., the Tenants were not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from April 1, 2021 to May 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective April 16,
2021.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on September
3, 2021. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,850.00.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,850.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from July 19, 2019 to
April 16, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy is terminated as of September
3, 2021, the date the Tenants gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.




File Number: SOL-21586-21
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $7,595.75*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to September
3, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
11, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 12, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
