Tenant’s evidence
and submissions
 
4.    
The Tenant testified that on August 9, 2020, before
the tenancy began, she went to see the rental unit and she saw a
pest control person in the rental unit. The Tenant said she right away sent a text message to the
Landlord and asked her why the pest control person is in the rental unit. The Landlord
responded that the pest control person is
there for a follow up visit because she had yearly pest control contract
with them.
 
5.    
The Tenant
testified that she started living in the rental unit from September 4, 2020. On the very
first night in the rental unit she found bed bugs in the main bedroom. On
September 5, 2020 the Tenant first told the Landlord through a text message
about the




 
bed bug issue in the rental
unit. The Landlord
responded on the same day and said that it was a ‘stink bug’ not a bed bug.
 
6.    
The Tenant stated she started suffering
bites from the day they moved into the rental unit. Between September 5, 2020 and
September 8, 2020, she complained several times to the Landlord verbally and
via text messages and advised the Landlord of multiple bed bugs sightings
in the rental unit. The Tenant stated that she sent pictures of her children’s
arm with bed bug bites.
The Landlord responded to the
complaints via text messages and acknowledged that there had been bed
bug issue for the last three months. The Landlord told the Tenant that Abell Pest
Control performed bed bug treatment in the rental unit during the summer of
2020. A copy of the text messages between the parties regarding the bed bug
issue was submitted into evidence by the Tenant.
 
7.    
The Tenant stated that she spoke with Abell
Pest Control company
that told her that
they had been dealing with bed bugs in the rental unit for two years. The
Tenant stated that many potential tenants had come and go because of the bed
bug issue. The Tenant did not submit any evidence in support of her statement.
 
8.    
The Tenant
stated that after making several
complaints, the Landlord
called ‘Abell Pest Control’ and arranged three bed bug
treatments in the rental unit during the month of September and October 2020. However, the bed bug issue continued
despite the treatment.
 
9.    
The Tenant stated that because of the bed bug issue in the rental unit, she had “blanket-
anxiety” and nightmares and had no options except
to vacate the rental unit. The Tenant stated that with the Landlord’s
permission she vacated the rental unit on December 1, 2020. The Tenant stated
that the traumatic experience of living in the rental unit had a negative
emotional and financial impact on her.
 
10. 
The Tenant
stated that on September 8, 2020 the Landlord reimbursed her $750.00 via interac The Landlord stated that she
had reimbursed this amount to the Tenant for the inconvenience caused by the
bed bug issue.
 
Landlord’s evidence and submissions
 
11. 
The Landlord testified
that a previous tenant ‘Gurukaranviv Singh’ of the lower unit reported a mice issue
on November 30, 2018 (Page 4/79). The Landlord contacted Abell Pest Control company and signed a one-year pest control
service contract for the residential complex on July 1, 2019. The Landlord
further stated that there was no bed bug issue in the residential complex
reported to her until March 2020.
 
12. 
The Landlord
stated that previous tenants
of both the upper and lower units had
reported itching and bed bug biting (Page 2, 7 and 20). The Landlord stated
that on August 5, 2020, the Pest Control company
treated the entire residential complex for bed bugs. The service report
revealed presence of bed bugs specifically in the rental unit. The Landlord
stated that after this treatment the tenants never reported bed bug issue in the residential
complex.




 
13. 
The Landlord testified
that on September 5, 2020 she received text message from the Tenant regarding
the presence of bed bugs in the rental
unit. The Landlord testified that the Tenant’s first complaint
regarding the presence of bed bug was responded to by having Abell perform a
treatment in the rental unit on September 10, 2020.
 
14. 
The Landlord testified
that Abell gave a one-year warranty for the treatment. The pest control treatments and follow up treatments by Abell were completed for the rental
unit on August 5, 2020,
August 9, 2020, September 8, 2020, September 10, 2020, September 24, 2020,
October 1, 2020 and November 3, 2020. The Landlord also testified that the pest
control treatment service reports indicate that bed bug activity report was
found on August 5, 2020, September 8, 2020
and November 3, 2020. (Landlord evidence 58 - 65).
 
15. 
The Landlord
acknowledged that she received pictures of bed bug bites on Tenant’s child’s arm. The Landlord also acknowledged that it was a turmoil for the Tenant to live in
the rental unit.
 
16. 
The Landlord stated
that she immediately responded to the bed bug complaint and had multiple treatments in the rental
unit to eliminate
the bed bug issue. The Landlord
stated that she has paid a lot of money to Abell,
but she they misled her into believing
that they had completely treated the
rental unit and that their work has a warranty.
 
17. 
The Landlord
testified that on September 8, 2020 she reimbursed $750.00 to the Tenant
via interac for the disturbance and inconvenience caused by the bed bug issue.
The Landlord stated that she allowed the Tenant to move out of the rental unit
on December 1, 2020.
 
Analysis
 
18. 
Section 20 of the Act
holds the landlord responsible for providing and maintaining a residential
complex, including the rental units in it, in a good state of repair and fit
for habitation and for complying with health, safety,
housing and maintenance standards.
 
19. 
In Onyskiw v. CJM Property
Management, 2016 ONCA 477 (CanLII), the Court of Appeal
determined that a contextual approach should be adopted when considering a
landlord’s potential breach of subsection 20(1) of the Act and a breach will
not be found if the landlord’s response to a maintenance issue was reasonable
in the circumstances.
 
20. 
There is no dispute
that the Landlord
was first notified by the Tenant on September 5, 2020 regarding bed bugs in the rental unit.
 
21. 
There is no dispute
that the Tenant had a bed bug infestation which was treated
over the course of three
months. The first bed bug treatment was completed on September 8, 2020. I find that the Landlord responded to the Tenant’s
complaints by having Abell Pest Control Company complete bed bug
treatments on September 8, September 10, September 24, October 1 and November
3, 2020. However, the Landlord knew that despite these multiple treatments
there was an ongoing bed bug issue in the rental unit. There were more
effective methods available, but the Landlord persisted in using




 
methods that had proven
to be ineffective. I am not satisfied that the treatments were adequate in resolving the bed bug issue in the rental
unit.
 
22. 
Therefore, I find that
the Landlord failed to meet the Landlord's obligations under subsection 20(1)
of the Act to maintain
the rental unit and failed
to comply with health,
housing and maintenance standards because of a bed bug infestation.
 
Remedies
 
23. 
The Tenant
seeks an abatement of rent of $3,000.00 equal to 100% rent for November
and December 2020 or 50% refund of rent from September 1, 2020 to Dec 1, 2020.
 
24. 
Based on the evidence
before me, I am satisfied that the Tenant experienced
a significant level of inconvenience,
and emotional turmoil as a result of the bed bug infestation. The Tenant has not established that the
infestation had an impact on her or on her children’s emotional health
as a result of the bed bug infestation. She provided
no medical evidence in support of her claim.
Therefore, I find that the Tenant should be awarded a 50% rent abatement. As
the monthly rent is $1,500.00 and the Tenant lived in the rental unit for 3
months, after deducting $750.00 abatement that the Landlord has already given
to the Tenants, the total abatement is $1,500.00. An order will issue
accordingly.
 
25. 
Tenant also seeks $4,873.00 representing the replacement costs for the following
items that she had to dispose of after the Landlord failed to resolve
the bed bug issue in the rental unit.

26. 
The Tenant’s evidence
regarding her financial losses and reimbursement was problematic. I am not persuaded that the Tenant had to replace all her furniture
and other belongings. The Tenant
did not provide any receipts in support of her claim. It is
possible those items may have needed to have been thrown out. The Tenants did
not lead any expert evidence to establish that the items could not have been
salvaged. Under section 16 of the Act the Tenant had an obligation to take
reasonable steps to minimize her losses. For
example, the Tenant did not ask the Landlord
to clean or treat her belongings
when the Tenant realized that some of her belongings had been infested with bed
bugs.
 
27. 
Based on the evidence
before me, I am not satisfied that the bed bugs damaged the two red
nightstands, one blue luggage rollie, Tenant’s two tall dressers, one short
dresser, one giant light Christmas tree, one vacuum and eight pairs of shoes.
None of these items are typical locations for bed bugs to live. As a result, I
am not satisfied that the bed bugs infested these items or that these items were damaged
by the bed bugs. I will disallow the claim for these items that comes to
$1,810.00. The Tenant did not provide receipts supporting the cost of items
that had to be replaced. However, it is important to note that documentary
evidence in not the only type of evidence admissible in such a proceeding. I am
satisfied that the bed bug issue likely caused damage to the remaining items.
The total cost claimed for the remaining items is $3,058.00. I also must
consider the fact that the remaining items were not brand new when they were
disposed of. Based on the evidence before me and my knowledge of similar cases,
I am satisfied that a sum of
$1,530.00 represent the reasonable costs of replacing the remaining damaged
items.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord shall pay
to the Tenant $1,530.00. This represents the reasonable costs that the Tenant will incur for replacing property
that was damaged
and disposed of due to the bed bug infestation in the rental
unit.
 
2.    
The Landlord
shall also pay to the Tenant an abatement of rent in the amount
of
$1,500.00.
 
3.    
The Landlord
shall also pay the Tenant
$53.00 for the cost of filing
the Tenant’s application.
 
4.    
The Landlord
shall pay the Tenant the full amount
owing of $3,083.00 by January 30, 2022.




 
5.     If the Landlord
does not pay the Tenant
the full amount
owing by January 30, 2022, the Landlord will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 31, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
