Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006

In the matter
of:


1, 248 GLENNIE
AVENUE EAST HAMILTON ON
  L8H5W4


 




Between:


Parveen Bhatti


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Christopher Boutilier
  Leeann Boyd


Tenants



 
 
 
Parveen Bhatti (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Christopher Boutilier (‘CB’) and Leeann
Boyd (together, the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
975 6332 3621#
on November 24, 2021.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant
CB attended the hearing. The Landlord’s son, H.Bhatti (‘HB’), attended both as a witness and to
assist the Landlord with communication.
 
The amount claimed by the Landlord
in outstanding rent is
significant, a situation
that stems in part from the extended procedural
history of this application. A review
of that history sets the context for the hearing of this matter on November 24,
2021.
 
The Board’s first order
in this matter
was a standard voidable termination order issued on October 2, 2020 following an uncontested
hearing of the Landlord’s L1 application. The
Tenants requested that the order be reviewed and that the order be stayed until
their request to review was resolved. The order was stayed and a review hearing
scheduled for November 17, 2020.
The review was allowed and a new
hearing was scheduled for January 19, 2021. The order from the November 17,
2021 hearing was not issued until January 27, 2021. It confirmed the granting of the Tenants’
request for review and confirmed
that the Tenants
had been given time
to prepare to raise issues under
section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). The Tenants did not attend the January 19, 2021 hearing and did not file materials with respect to their section 82 matters in advance of the
hearing. The January 19, 2021 hearing gave rise to Order SOL- 12114-20 dated
January 29, 2021, again granting the Landlord’s L1 application and ordering
that the tenancy be terminated subject to the standard voiding-by-payment
provisions. The Tenants requested a review of that order, on the basis that
they were not reasonably able to attend the January 19, 2021 hearing. The hearing of the matter was scheduled
for April 14, 2021. The Landlord, the Landlord’s son and the Tenants attended
that hearing, but there was insufficient time to hear the matter and it was
adjourned.




 
An interim order dated April 20,
2021 was issued following the April 14, 2021 appearance. That order directed that the notice of hearing for the
rescheduled hearing be sent by email to all parties, to the email addresses
given by the parties on April 14, 2021, to ensure that no further Canada Post
issues of the sort claimed by the Tenants occurred. The interim order directed that both the Landlord and the
Tenants provide the other, and file with the Board, a copy of any materials on
which they intended to rely at the hearing and which had not already been
exchanged. The interim order directed
the Tenants to provide to the Landlord and file with the Board a list of all issues
the Tenants planned
to raise at the
hearing. The interim order noted that
any party who failed to comply with an order for disclosure may not be
permitted to rely on evidence that was not properly disclosed.
 
The Tenants
did not provide a list of issues or materials to either the Landlord or the Board prior to the November 24, 2021 hearing,
and certainly not by
the April 30, 2021 deadline
stipulated in the April 20, 2021 interim order.
 
Determinations:
 
Rent Arrears:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period from
August 1, 2019 to November
30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective December 19, 2019.
 
2.     The Landlord claimed that the Tenants owed $3,000.00
in rent for 2019 and that the Tenants had paid no rent in either 2020 or 2021. The Landlord claimed
that, as of the
date of the hearing, the Tenant owned $30,790.00 in rent arrears.
The monthly rent is
$1,200.00.
 
3.     The Tenant CB acknowledged that he had paid no rent in
2021. He indicated that the other Tenant no longer shared
the unit with him
and that he cannot afford
the rent on his
own.
 
4.     The Tenant CB disputed the amount claimed by the
Landlord for 2020, saying that he made one payment of $700.00 in September, a
payment of $400.00 and a payment of either $500.00 or $600.00 at some other times in 2020. The Tenant testified
that after he had received the N4 notice of
termination he made these payments to HB, for the Landlord, on the
understanding that the Landlord would not pursue eviction on the basis of
non-payment of rent. He testified
that he was surprised, in light of having made these payments, that the
Landlord obtained an order from the Board to terminate the tenancy and that the
Landlord arranged for the Sheriff to evict the Tenant.
 
5.    
The Tenant CB offered no document
or other evidence to support his testimony that he had made the three
rent payments in 2020. The Landlord and HB denied receiving any payments in 2020.
 
6.     The onus is on the party claiming
to have made a payment to prove that the payment
was made. I noted that the Tenant CB was vague about the amounts he
claimed to have paid – both in terms of amount and timing. I find that the Tenant CB has failed, in
light of the




 
conflicting testimony, to meet
the onus of establishing that he made rent payments in 2020. I find that the Tenants’
arrears as of the date of the hearing amounted to $30,600, as claimed by the Landlord.
 
Section 82 Issues:
 
7.    
The Tenant CB claimed that the
rental arrears should be offset by rental rebate for two issues: first, that the Landlord
had failed to make necessary
repairs to the furnace; and second, that the Landlord had failed
to address an issue with rats in the unit.
 
8.     I find, as follows, that the Landlord
acted reasonably, and in compliance with her obligations
under the Act, with respect to the furnace:
 
a)    
The Tenant CB testified that the
Tenants took possession of the unit in July 2019. When they first tried to turn on the heat in October 2019
they found that it did not work. Two weeks later, after the
Tenants complained to the Landlord, the Landlord sent someone to check the system. That person indicated to the Tenant
CB that the radiator
for the air conditioner had gotten clogged and that it needed to be replaced. Two weeks later the heat stopped working
again (which I took to mean that the heat began working following the person’s
visit). CB testified that at that point the relationship between the Tenants
and the Landlord had become problematic. He
acknowledged that he did not communicate further with the Landlord about the
furnace except that he “recently”, meaning a
few weeks prior to the November
24, 2021 hearing, sent a text
to the Landlord to say that the problem
lay with the radiator and not with the furnace
itself. There was no intervening complaint to the Landlord about heat
and the Tenants dealt with the problem themselves by using electric heaters;
 
b)    
The Landlord confirmed that she
owned the residential complex in which the Tenant’s unit is located. She testified that new furnaces were
installed in each of the three units in the complex
in January 2019, shortly
before the Tenants
took occupancy. When she
received the Tenants’ complaint about the furnace she contacted the person who
normally does heat-related work for her. He was not available so she arranged
for a visit by the same person
who had installed the furnaces in the units in 2019. When that person attended at the unit, the
Tenant CB would not allow him access despite the fact that the Landlord had
given the Tenants two days’ notice of entry.
A person from Reliance subsequently attended at the unit. He reported to
the Landlord that the only issue with the heat was that items outside the house
had blocked the furnace outlet. Once the items were cleared the furnace worked
fine. The Reliance person told the
Landlord that the outside needed to be kept clear, that the heat was working
and that no repairs were required. The
Landlord heard nothing further from the Tenants about problems with the heat;
 
c)     
I find that the Landlord acted
reasonably and promptly in response to what she understood, from the Tenants
and from Reliance to be the problem. CB
did not contest the Landlord’s assertion that he had denied entry to the first technician who attended at the unit. In any event, all indications were that the heat resumed
following the visit by the heat repair person and that the Tenants gave the
Landlord no subsequent indication that there was a further problem; and




 
 
 
d)    
I
find that the Tenant has failed to establish that any rental
rebate is warranted for the issue with the
furnace.
 
9.     I find, as follows, that the Landlord
delayed somewhat in responding to the Tenants’ complaints about rats and that
this delay warrants some rental rebate:
 
a)    
The Tenant CB testified that, beginning
in the fall of 2019, the unit became infested with rats. He complained to the
Landlord and sent her pictures to prove the problem. The Landlord indicated to him that she did not believe
there was a problem and that he had concocted the pictures;
 
b)    
The Landlord failed to take any meaningful action
and for the past two years the Tenant
CB has controlled the problem as best he could using poison and traps. He could not afford, initially, to pay for the poison and traps to control the problem. The rats were, as
of the date of the hearing, under control thanks to his efforts, but the
problems had been significant for at least a year subsequent to the fall of
2019;
 
c)     
The Tenant testified that someone came to the unit months
after his initial
complaints. That person was treating all the units in the complex for
various pests, including cockroaches. The
person did not solve the problem;
 
d)    
The Landlord confirmed that the
Tenants had complained about rats and acknowledged that she thought
he was making up excuses
to avoid paying rent. The Landlord was vague about the
timing of the Tenants’ initial
complaint. She estimated that the complaint from the Tenant was not
received until about a year prior to the November 24, 2021 hearing;
 
e)    
The Landlord’s son, HB, could not
recall the exact timing of the Tenants’ initial complaint but estimated that it was in late 2019 or early 2020. I find, on the basis of the
Tenant CB’s specific testimony, that the initial complaint was in or about
October 2019;
 
f)      
HB testified that he arranged for
Abell pest control to visit the unit in response to the Tenants’ complaints. The Abell technician went to the unit once but was refused access by the Tenant CB on every
subsequent attempt to access the unit;
 
g)    
HB testified that the Abell technician
told HB, after the technician’s
first and only visit, that he had left traps but that they would not be effective without
the Tenants clearing significant clutter, particularly
in the basement. HB testified that
this information was communicated to the Tenant CB by both him and the Abell
technician but, to the knowledge of HB, was not acted upon by the Tenant.
 
h)    
I find that it is more likely than
not that the Landlord delayed in responding to the Tenants’ complaints about rats as she did not believe
that there was a problem.
The evidence about the timing of the Abell technician’s visit was vague
but I consider it more likely than not, given the Landlord’s estimate of timing
of the Tenant’s first complaint, that it was at least a year after the Tenants complained. I consider this




 
delay to have been unacceptable and find a modest rental
rebate for 12 months to be
appropriate;
 
i)       
I also find, based on the
uncontroverted evidence of HB, that the Landlord was thwarted by the Tenant –
both by the Tenant’s failure to address clutter in the basement and by the Tenant’s refusing
further access to the Abell technician – from
further addressing the rat issue. As a result I find that the Tenant is not
entitled to further rental rebate after the first 12 months of the issue; and
 
j)       
I
find that the Tenant is entitled to $100.00 per month rebate for twelve months, for a
total of $1,200.00.
 
Section 83 Determination
 
10.  The Tenant CB acknowledged that he could not afford to
pay rent at the unit. He indicated in
the hearing that he had made arrangements with a housing assistance program for affordable accommodation. He indicated that this accommodation would be available
within two weeks from the date of the hearing- that is, by mid-December
2021.
 
11.  I note that the
Landlord had been without rent for roughly two years as of the date of
the hearing and that the delay in the final hearing
was attributable to the Tenants’
success in obtaining repeated
reviews of earlier orders.
 
12.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28,2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $29,437.99*, which represents $30,637.99 for rent owing and
compensation up to November 30, 2021 less a rental rebate of $1,200.00.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$39.45 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting December 1, 2021
to the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
29, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.




 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022 the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenants
wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, they must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
 
i)               
$33,190.00 if the payment
is made on or before February 28, 2021**.
 
9.    
If the Tenants do not make full
payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline,
then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
10.  The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after March 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once
during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
