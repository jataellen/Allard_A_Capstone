Tenants



 
 
IMH POOL XX LP
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ryan
Cherry and Dennis Dunsten (the 'Tenants') because they, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have wilfully
or negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also
applied for an order requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the damage;
and because they, another occupant
of the rental unit or
someone they permitted in the residential complex have substantially interfered
with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 27, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s
legal representative Curtis Begg and the Landlord’s witness Rose Dagley
attended the hearing. The Tenants
were not present
or represented by 11:22 a.m. although
properly served with notice of the hearing by the Board.
 
Reasons:
 
1.    
The Tenants
vacated the rental
unit on November 16, 2020.
As a result, the application to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants is moot. In the
circumstances, the Landlord abandoned all claims apart from the Landlord’s
claim to compensation in the amount of
$3,723.35 for alleged damage
to the intercom system.
 
2.    
The Landlord
filed the application on October 13, 2020. At that time, subsection 89(1) of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) provided:
 
89 (1) A
landlord may apply to the Board for an order requiring a tenant to pay
reasonable costs that the landlord has incurred or will incur for the repair of
or, where repairing is not reasonable, the replacement of damaged property, if
the tenant, another occupant
of the rental unit or a person whom the tenant permits
in




 
the residential complex wilfully or negligently causes
undue damage to the rental unit or the residential complex and
the tenant is in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The Landlord
filed the application on October 13, 2020 and the Tenants
were in possession of the
rental unit at this time.
 
4.    
I accepted Ms. Dagley’s
uncontested evidence to the effect that a person named Josh who was residing
with the Tenant as an occupant purposely caused damage to the Landlord’s intercom
system. Josh caused this damage
by throwing the outside garbage can into the lobby, kicking the
glass pains and slamming his elbow into the intercom screen. This damage was
undue, in that it was not normal wear and tear.
 
5.    
As to how Ms. Dagley
knew that this person named Josh was residing with the Tenant and was therefore
an occupant when he caused the damage to the intercom, Ms. Dagley testified that Mr. Cherry
admitted this to her in a conversation to support his assertion that he should not be held responsible for
the actions of others. I accepted Ms. Dagley’s uncontested evidence on this
point. Although it may seem unfair to the Tenants, the Act makes the Tenants
responsible for the behaviour of their occupants and guests. As to how Ms.
Dagley knew that Josh caused the damage to the intercom system, Ms. Dagley
testified that the incident was captured by the Landlord’s security footage.
Ms. Dagley introduced still photos drawn
from that footage demonstrating that a person
she identified as Josh caused the damage described above. I accepted this
evidence and find that it demonstrates wilful undue damage.
 
6.    
The Landlord supported
its claim for $3,723.35 with an invoice from Ace Professional Lock Service
dated August 20, 2020. The Landlord’s total
cost to repair the damage was
$3,723.35. I find that the Landlord
incurred these costs to repair the wilful
undue damage caused by Josh
and that these costs are reasonable.
 
7.    
The Landlord
has proven its claim on the balance
of probabilities and the Tenants
will be ordered to pay the
Landlord $3,723.35.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of November
16, 2020, the date the Tenants gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord $3,723.35, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the
full amount owing on or before January 22, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 23, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
