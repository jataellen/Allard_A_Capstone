and


 




 


Dawnia Wade


Landlord



 
 
Margaret White (the 'Tenant') applied for an order determining that Dawnia Wade (the
'Landlord') has collected or retained money illegally. (T1 Application)
 
Margaret White (the 'Tenant')
applied for an order determining that Dawnia Wade (the 'Landlord') harassed,
obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with the Tenant, entered the
rental unit illegally and substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenant or by a member of the
Tenant's household.( T2 Application)
 
This application was heard via videoconference on December 2, 2021
at .
 
Only the Tenant’s Agent Jen White acting as POA
attended the hearing. As of 10.54
a.m., the Landlord was not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
T1 Application
 
1.    
The following determinations are based on the Tenant’s
uncontested testimony and the
supporting documents the Tenant submitted.
 
▪ 
The tenancy commenced on December 1, 2018.
 
▪ 
The monthly rent was $680.00.
 
▪ 
The Tenant vacated the unit on August 29, 2020.




 
 
▪ 
The Landlord never paid the Tenant
any interest on her last month’s rent deposit.
 
2.     The Tenant testified
that interest was never paid on the December 2018’s
rent of $550.00 and the $20.00 damage payment.
 
3.     The lease rental
lease agreement indicates
that Tenant was required to pay a
$20.00 damage payment.
 
4.     However, requiring
a tenant to pay a damage deposit
is contrary to section
105 of the Act. Subsection 105(1) of the Act states that the only security deposit that a landlord may collect is a
rent deposit collected in accordance with section 106.
 
5.     It is uncontested that the Landlord has not paid any
interest to the Tenant on the last month’s
rent deposit. Subsection 106(6) of the Act states
that a landlord shall pay interest
to the tenant annually on the amount of the rent deposit. I find that
interest is payable to the Tenant on her deposit for the period December 1, 2018 to August 29, 2020 calculated as
[($550.00 x 2.0%) ÷ 365 days/year] x 637 days = $19.19
 
6.    
An order will be issued requiring
the Landlord to pay to the Tenant the $420.00 for the rent deposit
collected illegally and $19.19
for interest on her
rent deposit.
 
T2 Application
 
7.    
Based on the Tenant’s
uncontested evidence, it was determined that the
Landlord
 
▪  Regularly entered the property
illegally without a notice. There was another illegal entry on August 26, 2019
when the Landlord showed up with a gentleman unannounced for bed bugs spraying.
The police needed to be called.
 
▪  Kept the mailbox locked without and
being the only one with a key. The tenants had to wait until
the landlord picked
up her personal mail and would
then distribute the tenant’s mail. At times, forcing the tenant to wait for
important medical and financial documents.
 
▪  Prohibiting family members from
visiting Tenants without permission. Signage
was posted at the front
entrance and inside
the main foyer.
The tenant’s son or daughter were not allowed to visit without an
approved permission.




 
 
 
▪  Constant intimidation and threat of
immediate eviction. This includes an incident
on March 21, 2020, when Tenant refused
to sign, landlord grabbed her arm and pulled it. Tenant had
a triple bypass one month prior. There is video evidence provided.
 
Remedies:
 
8.     Guideline 6 of the Board’s Interpretation Guidelines
states that, in determining the amount of an abatement for the violation of a
tenant’s rights, the Board will consider factors such as the landlord’s intentions in doing the action complained of by the tenant, whether the
landlord was motivated by malice toward the tenant, the extent of the harm
suffered as a result of the landlord’s actions, whether the tenant contributed
to or aggravated the situation, the frequency or duration of the landlord’s
actions, including the number of occasions on which the conduct occurred.
 
9.    
The Guideline
suggests that the abatement may be expressed as a portion of the rent that
would reflect the seriousness of the expected effects on a tenant, which would normally be allowed for the periods
in which the actions
occurred. It is also stated in the Guidelines that abatement is not a
punishment for the landlord but is intended to compensate the tenant for
contravention of the tenant’s rights. While the Guidelines are not binding upon me, I agree with the
approach stated in the Guidelines.
 
10.  I find that a 20% rent abatement for 12 months between
August 2019 and August 2020 is reasonable since it was the period when the
Tenant’s reasonable enjoyment was substantially interfered with subjected to constant
harassment. The rent was $680 during this period, which works out to a rent
abatement of $1,632 for 12 months.
 
11.  The Tenant is requesting that the Board
impose an administrative fine on the Landlord. The Board’s Guideline 16
clearly sets out the purpose of an administrative fine and states:
 
An administrative fine is a
remedy to be used by the Board to encourage compliance with the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the "RTA"), and to deter landlords from engaging
in similar activity
in the future. This remedy is not normally imposed unless a
landlord has shown a blatant disregard for the
RTA and other remedies will not provide adequate deterrence and compliance.




 
 
12. 
While I recognize
that I am not strictly bound by the Board’s Guidelines, they are a useful tool when determining the intent and purpose of various sections
of the Act.
 
13.  Based on the uncontested evidence,
it would see that the Landlord has shown a disregard for his obligations under the
Act. Given the severity of the breaches here,
the impact on the Tenants
of the Landlord’s behaviour, the other remedies awarded and my knowledge of
similar cases, I find that an administrative fine of
$1,000.00 is appropriate in these circumstances. An order will issue
accordingly.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord owes the Tenant $2,119.19 which includes:
 
▪ 
A
rent abatement of $439.19 for the breaches
in the T1 Application
 
▪ 
A
rent abatement of $1632.00 for the breaches
in the T2 Application
 
▪ 
$48 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
2.     If the Landlord does not pay the Tenant the full
amount owing by January 21, 2022 the Landlord
will owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from January 21,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
 
3.    
The Landlord shall pay to the Landlord
and Tenant Board
an administrative fine in the amount of $1000.00 by January
21, 2022.
