In the matter
of:


1268 TILSTON AVENUE WINDSOR ON N9B3C7


 




Between:


Windsor Essex
Community Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and
 
Stacey McMillan


 
 
Tenant



 
 
 
Windsor Essex
Community Housing Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Stacey McMillan (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that
the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 27,
2022. The Landlord's Legal
Representative, Madeline Roy and the Tenant spoke with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
September 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
February 28, 2020.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $955.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
 
5.    
The Tenant paid $2,376.00
after the application was filed.
 
6.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant and find that
it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until March 31, 2022 pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.

It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 31, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$24,025.92*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 4, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $31.40
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 5, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before March 31,
2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
April 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 31, 2022, then starting
April 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 1, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$25,963.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022,
or
ii)             
$26,918.00 if the payment
is made on or before
March 31, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after
April 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to
the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
