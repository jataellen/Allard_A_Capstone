Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12843-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


3708, 7 MABELLE AVENUE TORONTO ON M9A0C9


 




Between:


Aarti Sarpal


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Noor Al-lababidi


Tenant



 
On December 29, 2021, Aarti Sarpal (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Noor Al-lababidi (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant
pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on December 15, 2021 with respect to
application HOL-11937-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.    
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition(s) specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed
to pay to the Landlord
$2,495.00 on or before December 16, 2021 towards rent.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $13,156.00 for rent arrears and the costs
related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
HOL-11937-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $6,966.00* and
that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order
HOL-11937-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $7,485.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord. The landlord is holding a last month’s rent deposit that exceeds the
current monthly rent ($2,495.00), which is not permitted by the Act. The Tenant has been credited with $4,990.00
which is the difference between the amount currently held and the permissible
amount, and this credit is reflected on the Schedule as a payment. The last month’s rent deposit now equals
the current monthly rent.

It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Order HOL-11937-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant
must move out of the rental
unit on or before January 30, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$6,966.00*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 15, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $82.03
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 16, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
30, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 31, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 30, 2022, then starting
January 31, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 31, 2022.
