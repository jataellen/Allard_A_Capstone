Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
File Number: SOL-25150-21
 



In the
  matter of:


1, 23 LOTTRIDGE STREET HAMILTON ON L8L6T7


 




Between:


James Marley


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Jennifer Sheehan


Tenant



 
James Marley (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jennifer Sheehan (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 18, 2022. The Landlord, Landlord’s Agent, Dianne Moore, and the
Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant was in possession of the rental
unit on the date the application was filed.
 
2.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period
from September 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021.
 
3.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
4.     The monthly rent is $970.00.
 
5.    
The only amount outstanding is the Landlord's cost of filing the application. As a result, the order will be limited to costs
only and not eviction.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
2.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
February 4, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 5, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
