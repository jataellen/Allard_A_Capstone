In the matter
of:


280, # BROOK
STREET STREET MATTAWA ON
  P0H1V0


 




Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Heather Stockecke


Tenant



 
 
 
9328335 Canada Corp (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Heather
Stockecke (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully
caused undue damage to the premises and/or used the rental unit or the
residential complex in a manner that is inconsistent with use as a residential premises and that has caused or can be expected
to cause significant damage.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 13, 2021.
Only the Landlord’s Representative S. Sharma attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.   
The landlord served the tenant with a Form N7, with a notice
of termination date of July 18,
2021. The Landlord brought this
application under section 63(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
“Act”), on the basis the Tenant has used the rental unit in a way that is
inconsistent with its use as a residential premises and thus has caused or can
be expected to cause serious damage.
 
2.    The Landlord’s Form N7 alleges that the Tenant placed
an abandoned vehicle in the yard; allowed weeds/grass to grow unruly; and,
allowed domestic waste to pileup on the yard.
 
3.    As a preliminary matter, I raised whether the
allegations contained in the Landlord’s Form N7 disclosed a reasonable cause of
action.
 
4.    Even applying a broad and generous interpretation of
the Landlord’s application, I find there are no allegations of the Tenant using
the property in a way that is inconsistent with its use as a residential
premises, or of the Tenant causing serious damage. It is clear to me that the Landlord’s Form N7 does not
disclose a reasonable cause of action that could




File Number: NOL-43825-21
 
constitute a breach of section
63(1) of the Act. The Landlord’s
application must therefore fail.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord's application is dismissed.
