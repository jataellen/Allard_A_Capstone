Tenants




 


And


 




 


1473488
Ontario Limited


Landlord



 
 
 
Larry Labutte
and Lisa Ochenduszko (the 'Tenants') applied for an order determining that
1473488 Ontario Limited
(the 'Landlord') has charged illegal
rent or has collected or retained
money illegally.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 4, 2021.
 
The Landlord, the Tenant, Lisa Ochenduszko and the Tenant’s
representative, A. Mathieu attended the hearing
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants
claim that between
December 2018 and January 2019 the Landlord’s agent, Abi Afolobi, verbally
advised the Tenants that their rent would increase
by $200 starting February 1, 2019 in
exchange for repairs and maintenance at the residential complex.
 
2.     The Tenants paid the $200.00
increase starting February
1, 2019.
 
3.     The Tenants continued to pay the $200.00 increase
up to and including to January 31, 2020.
 
4.    
The Tenants allege that
this constitutes an illegal rent increase pursuant to the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’), and is thus void. In the alternative, they
submit that the Landlord has collected the money illegally. In the further
alternative, the Tenants
argue that they had an agreement to increase the rent above guideline within
the meaning of s. 121 of
the Act, but the Landlord did not do the work as agreed.
 
5.     For the reasons
that follow, I find that the Tenants’
application should be dismissed.




File Number: SWT-44439-20
 
The Increase is Deemed Not to be Void
 
6.    
The Act strictly
governs a landlord’s ability to raise the rent. Section 116(4) provides that an
increase that is made not in accordance with the Act is void. It is clear that
the Landlord did not comply with s. 116, and thus the increase
would otherwise be void. However,
s. 135.1 of the Act states as follows:
 
An increase in
rent that would otherwise be void under subsection 116 (4) is deemed not to be void if the tenant
has paid the increased rent in respect
of each rental period for at
least 12 consecutive months.
 
7.    
Subsection 135.1(5) of the
Act provides that s.135.1 applies with respect to an increase in rent even if it was charged
before s. 135.1 came into force, provided
the validity of the rent increase was not finally determined
by the Board before that day.
 
8.    
It was not disputed
that the Landlord raised the rent by an amount not permitted by the guidelines. The Tenants paid the increased
rent from February
1, 2019 to January 31, 2020,
that is for 12 consecutive months. The Tenants did not bring an application
within one year after the increase was first charged. As such, pursuant to
section 135.1 the rent increase is deemed not to be void.
 
9.    
Because there was no unlawful increase
in rent, the Tenants have not established that the Landlord
illegally collected or retained any money.
 
The Tenants did Not Bring a
T4 Application
 
10. 
The Tenants submit in
the alternative that they had an
agreement pursuant to s. 121 of the Act to increase the rent in exchange for certain improvements to be made to the rental unit.
 
11.  Section
121(2) of the Act requires, among other things,
that the agreement must be in a form approved by the Board. Unlike the
one-year limitation period for many other tenant applications under the Act, section 122 allows a Tenant to apply to the Board
up to two years after the
rental increase under the agreement first came into effect.
 
12. 
It was the Tenants’
evidence that the agreement was verbal, and thus was not entered
into using the Board-approved form.
 
13.  Given the tenant protection focus of the
Act, a landlord’s lack of compliance with the Act’s procedural requirement to have an increase in writing would not, in my view,
be sufficient for me to dismiss a tenant’s claim that a
verbal agreement under s. 121 was entered into. However, this is not a T4
application. While such an application could potentially be viable given the
two-year window and given the fact that the increase first came into effect in
February 2019, this is not a T4 application, and thus I cannot award a remedy
under s. 122.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenants’
T1 application is dismissed.
