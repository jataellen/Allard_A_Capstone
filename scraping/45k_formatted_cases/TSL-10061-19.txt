Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-10061-19
 











 
 
 

L H K, C K and LCLJ H I (the 'Landlords') applied for
an order to terminate the tenancy and evict M B (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in
the residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the
premises. The Landlords has also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to
compensate the Landlords for the damage; and because the Tenant has been
persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent. 
 
This application was heard in Toronto on December 4,
2019.
 
The Landlords and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The Tenant has resided in the rental unit since May of 2018 and pays
rent on a monthly basis in the amount of $2,036.00.
2.      On July 17, 2019, the Landlords gave the Tenant an N8 Notice of
Termination (‘N8 notice’) with a termination date of September 30, 2019
alleging that the Tenant has been persistently late with the rent. 
3.      On September 17, 2019, the Landlords gave the Tenant an N5 Notice of
Termination (‘N5 notice’) which was amended with handwritten notations by the
Landlords to list two different termination dates on its face being: September
30, 2019 and October 8, 2019.    
L2 Application: Substantial
Interference
4.     
Where a Notice of
Termination is required under the Act, it is an essential step in the
landlord's process of evicting a tenant. The Board’s Interpretation Guideline
10 sets out the following factors for consideration regarding notices of
termination: 
•       
The Board will not terminate
a tenancy and order eviction of the tenant unless the tenant has received a
valid Notice of Termination from the landlord. 
•       
The Notice of Termination
must specify a date of termination without doubt or condition.
•        
A landlord is entitled to
serve more than one notice of termination on a tenant and each notice of
termination may have a different termination date. Despite this, confusion to
the tenant must be minimized as notices may be challenged on the basis that
they are confusing and therefore defective, and an application may be
dismissed.
5.     
I find that the Landlords’
N5 Notice of Termination was invalid as it had two different termination dates
on the face of the notice and the Tenant testified that he did not understand
why or what it meant. I find that it was reasonable for the Tenant to find this
confusing. 
6.     
I find that the termination
date on the N5 notice was not sated without doubt or confusion and therefore I
find the N5 notice to be invalid.
7.     
The portion of the Landlords’ application based
on the N5 notice must be dismissed.
L2 Application: Persistent Late
Payment of Rent
8.     
The Landlord L K (‘LK’)
testified that the rent is due on the first of each month. LK testified that
each rent payment in the past twelve months was paid late by the Tenant. The
Tenant agreed that all of his rent payments in the last year were paid late. 
9.     
The Tenant testified that
the rent payments were generally between two to three days late, with the
exception of a few payments which were paid later than three days after the due
date. The Tenant testified that he believed that the law permitted him to pay
the rent a few days later than the due date and that it was his belief that
rent could be paid within the first 7 days of the month and would not be
considered late.
10.   The Tenant testified that his rent is generally paid
a few days late as he is paid by cheque by his company and at times he does not
receive his cheque on a timely basis from his boss and has to follow up with
him and personally attend at his office to collect his pay.
11.   On the basis of the evidence before me, I find
that the Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
Section 83
considerations
12.   The Landlords sought a termination of the
tenancy for December 31, 2019 as the Tenant has promised to pay the rent on
time in the past and has not. The Tenant requested that his tenancy be
preserved and that he be given another chance to pay his rent on time as he now
understood that it had to be paid on the first of the month. 
13.   The Tenant testified that he has taken on extra hours at work and is
now able to have a month’s rent on hand ahead of the first of the month, so
that if his pay cheque is late, he can still ensure that his Landlords receive
the full rent payment on or before the first of every month.
14.   I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
15.   I find that a prompt payment order is an
appropriate resolution which is often granted by this Board where a tenant has
persistently paid their rent late. 
16.   The Divisional Court has found on several
occasions that eviction should be ordered as a remedy of last resort, only be
ordered if it is not possible to bring a tenancy back into good standing. [Britannia
Glen Co-operative Homes v. Singh, cited in Toronto Community Housing Corp. v.
Thompson, [2003] O.R.H.T.D. No. 145, Langford v. Phipps, [1992] O.J.
No. 4184 (Ont. Gen. Div.)]    
17.   In persistent late payment cases a tenancy can
be brought into good standing where the tenant demonstrates a change in
circumstances or practices that can return the tenancy to good standing. In the
present case, the Tenant testified that he now has the means to pay the rent on
time and understands his obligation to do so.
18.   It was uncontested that there are no arrears of rent owing, only the
application filing fee remains outstanding. 
19.   The Tenant will be ordered to pay the rent on time and in full for a
12 month period. The loss of the tenancy has substantial potential prejudice to
the Tenant while the prejudice to the Landlords is minimized through the
Landlords’ ability apply to terminate the tenancy under s. 78 of the Act, if
the Tenant breaches the requirement for on time payments.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The Tenant shall pay the Landlords monthly rent owing on or before
the first day of each month commencing January 1, 2020 and continuing
thereafter until and including December 1, 2020.
2.      If the Tenant fails to make any of the payments in paragraph one
above, the Landlords may apply under section 78 of the Act, within 30 days of
the breach and without notice to the Tenant, for an order terminating the
tenancy and evicting the Tenant. 
3.      The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $175.00 for the cost of
filing the application.
4.      If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount owing in
paragraph three above on or before December 16, 2019, the Tenant will start to
owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from December 17, 2019
at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
