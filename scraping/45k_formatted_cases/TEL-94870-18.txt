Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-94870-18
 











 
 
 

B.V. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict A.G. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Whitby on October 5,
2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant
attended the hearing. 
 
Preliminary Issue:
 

At the hearing, the Landlord requested the consent of the Board
     to amend the application to identify the rental unit. The application is
     amended. 
The Landlord also clarified that he submitted the wrong notice
     of termination with the application. At the hearing, the Landlord provided
     the Board with a copy of the notice of termination on which this
     application is based. The notice is valid on its face and the dates on the
     note match the dates that appear on the certificate of service that was
     submitted with the application.  
Finally, the Landlord requested the consent of the Board to
     amend the application to claim rent only for September 2018 and not for
     August and September 2018. The application is amended.   

Determinations:

The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
     to pay for the period from September 1, 2018 to October 31, 2018.  Because
     of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
     August 16, 2018.
The outstanding arrears owing for the period ending October 31,
     2018, total $3,100.00. 
The Landlord paid $190.00 for the costs of filing the
     application and the Landlord is entitled to be reimbursed for those costs.
     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,550.00 from the
     Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the
     period from December 1, 2017 to August 16, 2018, in the amount of $19.79

9.    I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). In particular, I have considered that the
Landlord is requesting a “standard 11 day” remedial order and the Tenant
confirmed at the hearing that she would be able to pay the full amount of
outstanding arrears by “the middle of the month”. Due to the passage of time
since the date of the hearing, a “standard 11 day” order would give the Tenant
until October 30, 2018, to pay the arrears and void the order. As this is the
type of order the Landlord is requesting and the Tenant consented to this time
period, I find that it would be unfair in the circumstances to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before October
30, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $2,506.99*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to October 19, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $50.96 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
October 20, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before October 30, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
October 31, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before October 30, 2018, then starting October 31, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after October 31, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before October 30,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $3,275.00** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection
74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under
that subsection on or after October 31, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this
motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
