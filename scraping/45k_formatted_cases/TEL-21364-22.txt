Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-21364-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


503, 212 BROCK STREET PETERBOROUGH ON K9H2P5


 




Between:


Tvm Tower
Residences Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Michelle Lent Sylvain Meunier


Tenants



 
 
 
On January 18, 2022, Tvm Tower
Residences Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Sylvain Meunier and Michelle Lent (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on October
27, 2021 with respect to
application TEL-13298-20.
 
By an endorsement dated January
27, 2022, I had directed the matter to a hearing as the intention of the Landlord
was not clear on the face of the application, having indicated in Part 3 of
the L4 application that it was seeking only an order to end the tenancy and evict the Tenants, but then also inserting figures in
“Calculation of Amount Owing” that implied that it was also seeking arrears,
for which there was no substantiating accounting.
 
Having received post-endorsement
submissions from the Landlord’s representative, the Landlord’s representative
appears to have clarified that the intention on the application was to seek eviction
only. I am therefore satisfied that a hearing
is not required to resolve the ambiguity,
and an order may issue without the need for a hearing, based upon the
application as submitted.
 
Nothing in this order shall prejudice the Tenants’ statutory right to bring a motion under
subsection 78(9) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 to set it aside.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order of October
27, 2021 provided that the Landlord
could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the
Tenants did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants
have not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The
Tenants did not pay the lawful rent in full, on or before January 1, 2022. The Tenants also did not pay $210.00 to
arrears on or before January 1, 2022.




File Number: TEL-21364-22
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants
must move out of the rental unit on or before February 12, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 12, 2022, then starting February 13, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 13, 2022.
 
4.     The Board shall cancel the hearing previously scheduled for February
15, 2022 based on
my endorsement of January 27, 2022.
