Tenants




 


Carmen Bertilia Romero
Amador Lazaro Urbina Perdomo


 



 
 
Yaqun Li (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Lazaro
Urbina Perdomo and Carmen
Bertilia Romero Amador
(the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants
pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on February 22, 2021
with respect to application TNL-27726-20.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved
by order TNL-36508-22, issued on January
21, 2022. The Tenants filed a motion to set aside
order TNL-36508-22.
 
This motion
was heard by video conference on February 16, 2022.
The Landlord and the Tenants
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
Order TNL-27726-20 provided that the Landlord
could apply to the Board under section
78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and
evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain conditions specified in the
order.
 
2.     The Landlord filed the application under section 78 of
the Act, alleging that the Tenants failed to pay the rent for the month of
January 2022 on the first day of the month. As a result, ex parte order
TNL-36508-22, was issued terminating the tenancy.
 
3.    
Order TNL-27726-20 required the Tenants to pay portions
of the outstanding arrears of
$9,266.00 on a monthly
basis until completely paid off on August 1, 2022. The Tenant was also ordered to pay the monthly rent
on the first day of each month until August 2022.
 
4.    
The parties agree that in March 2021, the Tenants paid all outstanding arrears, much earlier than stipulated in the order.




File Number: TNL-36508-22-SA
 
5.     Based on all the evidence, the Tenants paid the
Landlord the full amount owing for the period
ending March 31, 2021. The amount paid represented all the rent that was in arrears under the tenancy agreement, all
the additional rent that would have been due under the tenancy agreement on the
date of the Tenants’ payment, and the filing fee for the application.
 
6.     The Landlord stated that the order also required the
Tenants to pay the monthly rent until August
2022 and failing
to pay January rent on the first was a breach of the order.
However, as contained in paragraph 3 of the order, the consequences of a breach were termination of the tenancy and
payment of all outstanding arrears. As the outstanding payments were made in March 2021, long
before the alleged breach, and the Landlord’s application was not based on
allegations of persistent late payment of rent, the Tenants satisfied the
requirements of order TNL-27726-20.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The motion to set aside
order TNL-36508-22, issued
on January 21, 2022, is granted. The order cannot be enforced by the
Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenants have satisfied the conditions in the order issued by the Board on February
22, 2021 with respect to application TNL-27726-20.
