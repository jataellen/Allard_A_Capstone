In the
  matter of:


2810, 21 WIDMER
STREET TORONTO ON M5V0B8


 




Between:


Shihong Yan


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Mario Lopez Andersons


Tenant



 
 
Shihong Yan (the 'Landlord') filed a request
to re-open the Landlord's application because Mario Lopez Andersons (the 'Tenant') did not comply
with the terms of their mediated settlement dated August 10, 2021.
 
This request was heard on February
15, 2022. The Landlord, represented by Yun Tao Li, and the
Tenant, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The agreement entered into by the parties required
that the Tenant should not substantially interfere with the reasonable enjoyment of any other person
in the residential complex.
 
2.     The Landlord alleges
that during an incident on October 10, 2021, a guest of the Tenant’s caused a disturbance and refused
to leave the residential complex.
 
3.    
The Tenant testified that it was
his ex-girlfriend who entered the complex without his permission by waiting for another resident
to open the door. The Tenant further
testified that he does not communicate with her and had nothing to do
with her on October 10, 2021.
 
4.     The agreement states that the Tenant will not
interfere with reasonable enjoyment. He
did not. Having said that, even if
the terms of the agreement are to be interpreted as in section 64 of the Act, to include another
occupant or a person the Tenant permits
into the residential complex,
I find the Tenant did not permit this person into the residential complex.
 
5.     I find, the Tenant did not breach the terms of the
agreement
