Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
 
File Number: TSL-25501-21
In the matter
of:      104, 135 EIGHTH STREET
ETOBICOKE ON M8V3C8
 
Between:                  Capreit Limited Partnership                                    Landlord
 
and
 
Kyle Snider                                                                                                                        Tenant
 
On November
10, 2021, Capreit Limited Partnership (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kyle Snider
(the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order
issued by the Board on November 2, 2021 with respect to application
TSL-23322-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed to pay to the Landlord
$500.00 on or before October
14, 2021 towards costs and
arrears of rent.
 
The Tenant also failed to pay to the Landlord
$700.00 on or before November
2, 2021 towards arrears of rent.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $8,086.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
TSL-23322-21. The amount
that is still owing from that
order is $8,086.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous
order TSL-23322-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenant has also
failed to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from
November 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.

It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TSL-23322-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 16, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $9,536.00*. This amount represents the rent owing up to November 30, 2021 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$47.67 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting December 1, 2021 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
16, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January
17, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 17, 2022.
