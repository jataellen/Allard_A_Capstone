Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-98998-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


930 DIANNE AVENUE ROCKLAND ON K4K1G8


 




Between:


Peta Gay Burrell Dain Burrell


Landlords




 


and


 




 


Norman King


Tenant



 
On November 23, 2021, Peta Gay Burrell and Dain Burrell
(the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Norman King (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant entered
into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlords and the Tenant
signed an agreement to terminate the tenancy as of
October 22, 2021.
 
2.    
Under subsection 77(3) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006,
the Landlord must make
the application not later than 30 days after the termination date specified in
the agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
3.     The Landlord filed the application on November 23,
2021. More than 30 days having
elapsed between the termination date and the filing of this application, the application has been made out of time and the Board
lacks jurisdiction to issue an order terminating the tenancy.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlords' application is dismissed.
