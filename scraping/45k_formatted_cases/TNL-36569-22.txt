  Jack Ruttan


Tenants



 
On January 20, 2022, Capreit
Limited Partnership (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Jack Ruttan and Adam Ruttan (the 'Tenants') and
for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board
on January 17, 2022 with respect to application TNL-35342-21 SA.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenants
if the Tenants did not meet certain
condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants
have not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenants failed
to pay to the Landlord
$2,100.00 on or before January
15, 2022 towards arrears of
rent.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears
of rent and compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenants were ordered
to pay $12,367.80 for rent arrears and the costs related to the
Landlord's application fee in Order TNL-35342-21 SA. The amount
that is still
owing from that order is
$12,367.80 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous
order TNL-35342-21 SA is cancelled.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,753.05 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from June 1, 2020 to February 4, 2022.

It is
ordered that:
 
1.     
Order TNL-35342-21 SA is
cancelled.
 
2.     
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 15, 2022.
 
3.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $10,613.00*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January
31, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the previous
application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit.
 
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$57.63 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 1, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
15, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 15, 2022, then starting February
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 16, 2022.

The tenant has until February 14, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by February 14, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on August 16, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
