File Number: TEL-21394-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


417, 40 GORDONRIDGE PL TORONTO ON M1K4H8


 




Between:


Toronto Community Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Melissa Foreman


Tenant



 
 
 
Toronto Community Housing
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Melissa Foreman (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant failed to meet a
condition specified in the order issued by the Board on November 19, 2020 with respect to application TEL- 10105-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the “Act”) alleges that the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on
November 19, 2020 with respect to application TEL-10105-20.
 
2.     The Landlord’s application was filed with the Board on January 25, 2022.
 
3.    
The entirety of the allegations of
the Tenant’s breach contained in the application read as follows: “The tenant failed
to pay $300 on or before December
15, 2021 as required in the
order. The tenant failed to make any
payment at all in the month of December 2021.”
 
4.     In accordance with paragraph
3 of
the previous order,
and in accordance with subsection 78(5) of the Act, an
application under section 78 of the Act shall not be made more than 30 days
after a failure of a tenant to meet a condition in a previous order of the type
described in subsection 78(1) of the Act.
 
5.     The only payments the Tenant was required to make in
December 2021 under the previous order were to pay the lawful
rent on or before the first day of each month, and to
pay $300.00 to arrears on or before
the 15th day of each month.
Any alleged breaches
of the previous order in December 2021 would therefore have occurred on
December 1, 2021 and December 15, 2021.
 
6.    
More than 30 days having elapsed
between any of the Tenant’s alleged breaches enumerated on the application and the filing
of this application, the Landlord is statute-




File Number: TEL-21394-22
 
barred from pursuing an application under
section 78 for the breaches
alleged in their application.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application under section 78 of the Act is dismissed.
 
2.     Order TEL-10105-20, issued
on November 19, 2020 remains
in effect.
