Review Order
 
 
Blair Feltmate (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Akram Mansour and Sanaa Mansour
(the 'Tenants') because
they, another occupant
of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the
residential complex have substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant; and
because the number of persons living in the unit on a continuing basis is more
than permitted because the number of persons living in the unit on a continuing
basis is more than permitted by health, safety or housing standards..
 
This application was resolved
by order CEL-02484-21 issued on January
5, 2022.
 
On February 4, 2022, the Tenants
requested a review
of the order. On March
30, 2022 that request to review was denied.
 
On April 8, 2022 the Tenants made
a second request to review the order. Landlord
and Tenant Board Rule 29.17 states that the Landlord
and Tenant Board will not consider a further request
to review the original order or the review order from the same
requestor. On April 11, 2022, Member
Wickett used her discretion to waive the Rule and directed this matter to a
review hearing.
 
Although the issues raised
in the second request to review could and should have been raised in the first request to review, the
request was heard at the direction of Member Wickett.
 
The request was heard on May 25, 2022. The Landlord,
represented by Madelaine McKenzie, and the Tenant Akram Mansour, represented by Varthan
Arul, attended the hearing.




 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord served the N5 notice on the Tenants
for two reasons. The Landlord
claims the Tenants have substantially interfered with his lawful right,
privilege or interest, and because the number of persons living in the unit on
a continuing basis is more than permitted by health, safety or housing
standards.
 
2.     I will first address
the issue of the number people
residing in the rental unit. The hearing order issued on January 5, 2022, finds that the Tenants are living in a rental
unit that has more people than permitted because the
number of persons living in the unit on a continuing basis is more than
permitted by health, safety or housing standards which contravenes subsection 67(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act.
This finding is based on
a by-law of the Condominium Corporation.
 
3.    
Section 67(1) of the Act is based
on a violation of health, safety or housing standards required by law. At this review hearing the Landlord
submits that the municipal by-law governing this rental
unit provides limitations on the number of people permitted to reside
in a dwelling.
 
4.     The Tenant’s representative submits that the square
footage of the rental unit is calculated to include
the kitchen. This was confirmed
by a reading of the by-law. It is the position of the Landlord’s
representative that the square footage required for five people to reside in
this rental unit is greater than the square footage required.
 
5.     There was no independent verification of the square
footage of the rental unit presented at the hearing. As a result, I cannot determine if the square footage meets the
requirements of the by-law of the municipality. Therefore, I cannot determine that the Tenant’s are in violation
of section 67(1) of the Act. I am
also not satisfied that a breach of the by-law of the Condominium Corporation
is a violation of health, safety or housing standards required by law. As such, I find the application cannot succeed on the basis of
the number of persons living in the unit on a continuing basis is more than
permitted by health, safety or housing standards.
 
6.    
The second reason to be addressed
is whether the number of people living in the rental
unit substantially interferes with the Landlord’s lawful right, privilege or
interest.
 
7.     The Landlord cites by-law 10.2 of the Condominium
Corporation regarding Occupancy. Maximum occupancy for each unit based on the by-law,
is based on the occupancy load determination in the
Ontario Building Code as prescribed
in O. Reg. 403/97. That being two
(2) persons per sleeping room in the dwelling unit.
 
8.    
The Landlord also points to the
Guide to Living at the Esprit, which
confirms that owners will restrict
occupancy to not more than the respective number of tenants
as two persons for a one-bedroom unit and five in a two-bedroom unit.
 
9.    
When the Tenants moved into the
rental unit in 2011, they did not
have children. They now have three children
aged 8, 10 and 11 years of age. As such there are five people
living in this one-bedroom unit.




 
 
 
10.  When owners or tenants choose to live in a condominium
there is a reasonable expectation that they will comply with the by-laws as set
out by the Condominium Corporation. The question
is whether these tenants, by not complying
with the by-laws
of the Condominium Corporation, are substantially interferes with the Landlord’s lawful right,
privilege or interest.
 
11.  An owner of a condominium who has tenants who are not
complying with the by-laws of the Condominium Corporation, may face
consequences from the Corporation if the situation is not remedied.
In this case the Corporation has warned the owner but has not taken action against the owner
because the owner is attempting to remedy the situation.
 
12.  Order CEL-02484-21 issued
on January 5, 2022, finds in paragraph 7, that the Tenants
made it clear at the hearing that they have no intention of complying with the
by-law.
 
13.  I find the Tenants violation of the by-law and the
consequences to the Landlord, are substantially interfering with the Landlord’s
lawful right, privilege or interest. Therefore,
I find the tenancy shall be terminated based on the notice served on the Tenants and their
failure to remedy the issue.
 
14.  In determining relief under section
83 of the Act, I find it fair to delay the termination of the
tenancy. The Tenants have resided in
the rental unit since 2011. They have
three children, one of whom is autistic. Testimony
shows that the Condominium Corporation will not take action against the
Landlord if the Landlord is taking reasonable steps to address the violation of
the by-law. Under the circumstances,
I find it fair to delay the lifting of the stay on order CEL-02484-21 issued on
January 5, 2022 until August 31, 2022
to provide the Tenants additional time to vacate the rental unit.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The request to review order CEL-02484-21 issued on January
5, 2022 is denied. The order is confirmed.
 
2.     The interim order issued on April 11, 2022 is cancelled. The stay of order CEL-02484-21 is lifted on August 31, 2022.
