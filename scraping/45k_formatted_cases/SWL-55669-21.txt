Landlord




 


and


 




 


Kathy Kanhai Michael Kanhai


Tenants



 
Michael De Rita (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Kathy Kanhai and Michael Kanhai (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did
not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 20, 2022. Only the Landlord
attended the hearing. As of 10:22 a.m., the Tenants were not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from December 1, 2019 to October
31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective June 8, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on October
15, 2021. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,150.00.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,150.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from September 22, 2021 to June 8, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy is terminated as of October
15, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.




File Number: SWL-55669-21
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $11,165.66*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to October
15, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or
before February 8, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 9,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
