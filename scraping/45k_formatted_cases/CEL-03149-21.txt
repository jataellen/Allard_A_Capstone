3125 Queen Frederica Holdings

and evict Mariona Kazimirow and Czeremicha Wisniewska (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 24, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Sam Ursino, attended
the hearing. As of 3:30 p.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to January

Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 24, 2021.

unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,316.85.
 
4.     The Tenants paid $6,033.99 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The only amount outstanding
as of the date of the hearing is $236.85 in arrears and
the Landlord's cost of filing the application. As a result,
the order will be limited
to costs only and not eviction.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $50.85,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January 31,
2022.
