Peter Wolff (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Joel Errol Radix (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard
by video conference on December
14, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord's Agent, A.J. Singh, attended the hearing. As of
2:12 p.m. the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective August 1,
2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant
vacated the rental
unit on November
30, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,139.00.
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,139.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy is
terminated as of November 30, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant possession
of the rental unit to the Landlord.
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $4,556.90*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to November 30, 2021, less the rent deposit.




File Number: SOL-24720-21
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 16, 2022, the
Tenant will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
