Her Majesty The
Queen In Right Of Canada (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Tara Mccullough (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on March
29, 2021 with respect to application TNL-24473-20.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved
by order TNL-34423-21, issued on September
17, 2021. The Tenant filed a
motion to set aside order TNL-34423-21.
 
This motion was heard by video conference on December 8, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord’s legal
representative, R. Coleman,
attended the hearing.
The hearing was scheduled for 9 a.m. The Tenant arrived at 9:55 a.m., after the
hearing was held.
 
Determinations:
 
1. The Landlord’s legal representative said that the Tenant had paid off all the arrears owed to the Landlord. Consequently, the Landlord consents to the
Tenant’s set aside motion.
 
It
is ordered that:
 
1.     Order TNL-34423-21, issued on September
17, 2021, is set aside.
 
2.     The Landlord's application under section 78 of the Act is dismissed.
