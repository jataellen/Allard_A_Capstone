Zhaohua Li (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Veronika Fridrichova and Mario Feco (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 15, 2022. Only the Landlord attended the hearing. As of 11:07 a.m., the Tenants were not present
or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from May 1, 2021 to October 31,
2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 10, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
vacated the rental
unit on December 31, 2021. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,050.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,050.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from May 14, 2020 to
July 10, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenants paid $3,650.00 after
the application was filed.




File Number: SOL-22981-21
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of December
31, 2021, the date the Tenants returned vacant possession of the rental
unit to the Landlord.
 
2.

Landlord $3,415.23*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to December
31, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before March
