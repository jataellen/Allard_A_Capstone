908, 20 SPEERS
ROAD OAKVILLE ON L6K3R5

Tenants




 


and


 




 


Myrle Du Cille-Small


Landlord



 
Kedemah Folkes (KF) and Graydon
Hynes (GH) (the 'Tenants') applied
for an order determining
Myrle Du Cille-Small (the Landlord) gave a N12 notice of termination in bad
faith.
 
This application was heard via video/teleconference on September 22, 2021.
Only the Tenant (GH) attended the hearing. As of 11:58
a.m., the Landlord
was not present or represented
at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the
Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     In this application, the Tenants allege that they
moved out of the rental unit because the Landlord gave the Tenants
an N12 Notice of Termination because the Landlord
required possession of the rental unit for use by a child of the
Landlord.
 
2.    
A Case Management Hearing
(CMH) was held by telephone on June 24, 2020
and only the Tenants attended the
hearing.
 
3.    
The Tenant (GH) testified that after being
served with the N12
on July 9, 2019, they began looking for alternate
accommodation and moved out of the rental unit on September 14, 2019.
 
4.     The N12 notice given to the Tenants
falls under section
48(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act).
 
5.     Subsection 48(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2006
(‘the Act’) which
states:
“a landlord
may, by notice, terminate a tenancy if the
landlord in good faith
requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation by
(a)  the landlord
(b)  the landlord’s spouse, or
(c)  a child
or parent of the landlord
or the landlord’s spouse. [Emphasis]




 
6.    
The Tenant (GH) asserts
that the Landlord
gave the Tenant a
N12 notice of termination
in bad faith because after the Tenants vacated the rental unit, a child of the
Landlord never moved into the rental unit.
 
7.     On an application to the Board,
the person who alleges a particular event occurred has the burden of proof that it is more
likely than not that their version of events is true. In this application, the
burden typically falls on the Tenant to establish that the notice of
termination was served in bad faith.
 
8.     The Tenant (GH) testified after they moved out of the unit a rental
listing was found online for the rental unit and the
advertised rent was $2,300.00.
 
9.    
Pursuant to section 57(1)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’), the Board
may make an order against a landlord if, on application by a former tenant of a
rental unit, the Board determines that,
(a) the
landlord gave a notice of termination under section 48 in bad faith, the former
tenant vacated the rental unit as a result of the notice … and the person
referred to in clause 48 (1) (a), (b), (c) or (d)
has not occupied the rental
unit within a reasonable time after the former tenant vacated the
rental unit.
 
10.  Subsection 57(1) (a) of the Act establishes a three-part test.
 
11.  In order to be successful in their T5 application, the Tenant must establish all three of the requirements of subsection 57(1)(a)
on a balance of probabilities:
First, that the Landlord
gave a notice of termination under section 48 of the Act (the N12 notice) in bad faith;
Second, that the Tenant vacated the rental unit as a result of the N12 notice or Board
order based on the N12 notice; and
 
Third, that the person named in the N12 notice did not move into the rental unit within
a reasonable time after the Tenants vacated.
 
12.  On an application to
the Board, the person who
alleges a particular event occurred has the
burden of proof to establish
that it is more likely
than not that their version
of events is true. In this application,
the burden typically falls on the Tenant to establish that the notice of
termination was served in bad faith.
 
13.  However, the fact that the rental unit was listed
for rent creates
a rebuttable presumption that
the Landlord served the N12 notice in bad faith.
14.  In other words,
in this case, the burden then falls on the Landlord to establish whether or not the rebuttable presumption
should apply.




 
15.  Subsections 57(5) and 57(6) establish
a rebuttable presumption of bad faith on the following ground:
For the purposes of an
application under clause (1)(a), it is presumed, unless the contrary is proven
on a balance of probabilities, that a landlord gave a notice of termination under section 48 in bad faith, if at any time during the period
described in subsection (6)
the landlord,
(a)  
advertises the rental unit for
rent…
 
16.  The period referred
to in subsection (5) is the period that,
(a)  
begins on the day the landlord
gives the notice
of termination under section 48; and
(b)  
ends one year after the former
tenant vacates the rental unit.
 
17.  The Landlord did not attend
the hearing to make submissions.
 
18.  It was uncontested that the Landlord served an N12 and that the Tenants moved out
due to the N12 notice and I found on the balance of probabilities that the
Landlord’s child did not move into the unit and reside there in accordance with
the N12 notice.
 
19.  Having considered the uncontested testimony
given by the Tenant (GH),
on a balance of probabilities I find the Notice of Termination was
not given in bad faith.
20.  The order contains
all the reasons for the decisions within
the order. No other reasons will be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
1.    
The former Landlord shall pay to the Tenants
$10,200.00. This amount
represents the increased rent that the Tenants have incurred.
2.    
The former Landlord shall also pay $50.00 the Tenants cost for the application fee.
3.    
The former Landlord shall pay the Tenants the full amount owing by February 28, 2022.
4.    
If the former Landlord does not
pay the Tenants the full amount owing by February 28, 2022, they will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the outstanding
balance.
5.    
If the former Landlord does not
pay the Tenants the full amount owing by February 28, 2022, the Tenants have the right,
at any time, to collect
only from the former
Landlord the full amount owing or
any balance outstanding under this order.
