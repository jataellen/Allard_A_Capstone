Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24653-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


322, 205 MELVIN
AVENUE HAMILTON ON L8H2J9


 




Between:


Indwell


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Alycia
Meszaros


Tenant



 
 
 
Indwell (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Alycia Meszaros
(the 'Tenant') because
she, another occupant
of the rental unit or someone she permitted in the
residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the
premises.
This application was heard in Passcode: 956 0593 7653#
on January 5, 2022.
 
Only the
Landlord’s Agent, Jane Verrps attended the hearing. The Tenant’s social worker,
Lisa Kellerman was at the hearing
who was not acting on the Tenant’s
behalf. The Tenant
was initially in attendance
but was not returning due to illness.
 
The Landlord
did not comply with disclosure rules and failed to provide
the Tenant with a copy of
the documents, receipts, photographs, recordings or like things she intended to
rely on at the hearing. She provided no explanation for not doing so. The
Landlord’s documentary evidence was not considered.
 
 
Determinations:
 
 
1. The Landlord states the
Tenant left garbage in the hallway on an ongoing basis. The Landlord also indicated on September 8, 2021 the Tenant lit something on fire while in the gazebo. There was no evidence given
about any physical damage caused to the rental unit or residential complex. The
Landlord did not meet the case required to obtain an eviction order under
section 62(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') because there was not enough evidence
that established the Tenant wilfully
or negligently caused undue
damage to the rental unit or complex.
