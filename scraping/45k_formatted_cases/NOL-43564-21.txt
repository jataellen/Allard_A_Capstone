Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Joshua Muckuck
  Julie Muckuck


Tenants



 
 
 
Amalia Rey-mcintyre (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Julie Muckuck and Joshua Muckuck
(the 'Tenants') because
they or another occupant of the rental
unit have committed an illegal act or have carried out, or permitted
someone to carry out an illegal trade, business or occupation in the rental unit or
the residential complex
involving the production of an illegal drug, the trafficking in an
illegal drug or the possession of an illegal drug for the purposes of
trafficking.
 
This application was heard by video conference
on November 22, 2021.
 
At 11:06
am, the Landlord
and the Landlord’s Representative Matthew Smiley attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
2.     On May 11, 21, the Landlord served
the Tenants with an N6 Notice to End Tenancy
for Illegal Acts or Misrepresenting Income in a Rent Geared to Income
Rental Unit (N6 notice). The date of termination on the N6 notice is June 11,
2021.
 
3.    
The Landlord’s L2 application was based on service of the N6 notice and was filed
with the Board on July 26, 2021.
 
 
According to the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’),
a Landlord may make
application to the Board:




File Number: NOL-43564-21
 
69 (1) A landlord may
apply to the Board for an order terminating a tenancy and evicting the tenant if the landlord
has given notice
to terminate the tenancy under this Act or the Tenant
Protection Act, 1997.
 
(2) An application under subsection (1) may not be made later than 30 days after he termination date specified in the notice.
 
4.     I find that the
Landlord’s application was not filed
within 30 days of the date of termination
as required by section 69(2) of the Act. For
that reason, the Landlord’s application must be dismissed.
 
5.    
The order contains all of the reasons for the
decision within it. No further
reasons shall be issued.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
