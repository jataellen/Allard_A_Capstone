and

Tenants



 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dixon Holdings
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Nadia Wolfe and Marlon Rhooms (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 31, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Charles
Berman, attended the hearing. As of 10:51 a.m.
the Tenants were not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants did not pay the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective September 28, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,073.92.
 
4.     After the application was filed, the Tenants paid all arrears
for the period ending January
31, 2022 plus $15.51 towards the Landlord’s cost of filing the application.
 
5.     The only amount
outstanding is the Landlord's cost of filing
the application. As a result, the order will be limited to
costs only and not eviction.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$170.49, which represents the balance of the
Landlord’s cost of filing the application.

2.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before February
22, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 23,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
