Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-23956-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


308, 41 WARRENDER AVENUE TORONTO ON M9B5Z6


 




Between:


Princess
  Apartments


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Fatemeh
  Kavoush


Tenant



 
 
 
Princess Apartments (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Fatemeh Kavoush (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021. The Landlord's Legal Representative, Bryan
Rubin and the Tenant attended the hearing and spoke with Duty Counsel prior to
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from March 1, 2020
to December 31, 2021. Because of the
arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 10, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant is in possession
of the rental unit.
 
3.     
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,569.54.
 
4.     
The Tenant paid $4,527.72 after the application was filed.
 
5.     
The Tenant testified that she paid the rent each month
except for the difference in rent
brought about by a successful above guideline application brought by the
Landlord. Although the Tenant disputed the total amount owing, no proof was
provided to substantiate the claim that she did not owe the amount claimed by
the Landlord. Besides, by her own admission, she failed to pay the increased
rent which understandably added up.
 
6.     
The Tenant has resided
in the unit since 2017 and receives $1,100.00 financial assistance from Ontario
Works as well as $960.00 in child tax benefit.




File Number: TSL-23956-21
 
7.     
The Tenant
gave the Landlord
a personal cheque
for December 2021 rent payment
on December 8, 2021, but this cheque has not yet cleared the bank. As a
result, the amount of that payment has not been deducted from the arrears as
calculated in this order.
 
8.     
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,538.78 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
9.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021
to August 10, 2021.
 
10.  
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the
Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant and find
that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 15, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of
the Act. Additional time given to the Tenant to pay the
outstanding amount.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before February 15, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $2,841.74*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 11, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
If the Tenant’s
personal cheque dated December 8, 2021 clears the bank, then the Landlord shall
apply the amount
of the cheque to the amount owing
and payable by the Tenant. Furthermore, if the Tenant
makes a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside
this order, then the cheque will be considered if it has cleared.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay
to the Landlord $51.60 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 12, 2022 to the date the
Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 15, 2022, the
Tenant will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from February 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
7.    
If the unit is not vacated on or before February 15, 2022, then starting February 16, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.




File Number: TSL-23956-21
 
8.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
February 16, 2022.
 
9.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$5,522.28 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$7,091.82 if the payment
is made on or before
February 15, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
10.  The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after February
16, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
