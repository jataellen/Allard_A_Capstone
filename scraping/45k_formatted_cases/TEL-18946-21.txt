Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-18946-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


2499
  NASH ROAD CLARINGTON ON L1C3K4


 




Between:


Brookhill Durham
Holdings Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Alan Boccinfuso Theresa Boccinfuso


Tenants



 
 
 
Brookhill Durham Holdings Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Theresa Boccinfuso and Alan
Boccinfuso (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord intends to demolish the rental
unit.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on February
1, 2022. The Landlord’s
representative Lucas Morini, and the Tenants’ representative Denise Ranger,
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord requires the rental unit to be vacated in order to demolish it. I am satisfied
that the Landlord has taken all reasonable steps to obtain the necessary
permits for this work.
 
2.    
At the hearing the Tenants’ representative requested a delay in terminating the tenancy. The
Landlord’s representative agreed to a six-month delay.
 
3.     The property in question is large. The home is located on a smaller
area of the property. The
parties agreed that the Landlord can commence work on the areas of the property
away from the home that do not substantially interfere with the Tenants’
reasonable enjoyment.
 
4.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until July 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
