Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number: EAL-95818-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
B, 680 TWEEDSMUIR AVENUE OTTAWA ON K1Z5P6


 




Between:


Logement Communautaire D'ottawa


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kamy Rhema Lusamba


Tenant



 
 
 
Logement Communautaire D'ottawa (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Kamy
Rhema Lusamba (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 6,
2021.
 
Only the Landlord’s agent, Beth Cumming,
attended the hearing. As of 9:39 a.m., the Tenant
was not present or represented at the hearing, although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
September 1, 2020 to October 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October 29,
2020.
 
2.     The monthly rent is
$130.00.
 
3.     The Tenant paid $1,150.00 after the application was filed.
 
4.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. Based on the uncontested evidence
provided by the Landlord at the hearing, I find that the Tenant failed to pay
the rent in full. I have no reason to deny the eviction requested by the
Landlord.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 26, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,097.93*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 15, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $4.27
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 16, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
26, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 27, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 26, 2022, then starting
February 27, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 27, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before February 26,
2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $761.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and
the Tenant could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 27, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
