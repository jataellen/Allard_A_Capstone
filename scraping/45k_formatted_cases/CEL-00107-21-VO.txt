In the matter
of:


UNIT 2, 27 TURNER COURT BRADFORD ON L3Z2W4


 




Between:


Curtis Robinson


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Angela Defrancesco


Tenant



 
 
On August 20, 2021 the Board
issued order CEL-00107-21 terminating the tenancy
and evicting Angela
Defrancesco (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant failed to pay rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
On December 14, 2021 the Tenant filed a motion to void order CEL-00107-21 because
before the eviction order
became enforceable, the Tenant paid Curtis Robinson (the 'Landlord') the amount
required to void the order under subsection 74(11) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').
 
The motion was heard by videoconference on February 3,
2022.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant attended
the hearing. The Landlord was represented by Kimberly
Beauvais. The Tenant did not wish to speak with Tenant Duty Counsel.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not previously made a motion
under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside an eviction order during the
period of the Tenant’s tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
2.    
The order issued on August 23, 2021 required the Tenant to pay $5,586.00
on or before September 3, 2021
to void the order. As of December 9, 2021, the date the Tenant filed her motion,
the rent for October and November 2021 came due bringing the amount due and owing to $9,486.00, since the
rent is $1,300.00 per month.
 
3.    
The Tenant’s affidavit states
payments were made to the Landlord via e-transfer after
the order’s enforceable date in the following amounts: $1,300.00 on
October 1, 2021;
$1,300.00 on November 2, 2021; $5,586.00
on December 8, 2021; and $1,674.14 on
December 9, 2021 totalling
$9,858.14.
 
4.     At the hearing,
the Landlord confirmed the receipt of these payments
which included the
$189.00 fee charged by the Court Enforcement Office.




File Number: CEL-00107-21-VO
 
5.    
Based on the evidence before the
Board, I find that the Tenant has voided the order dated August 23, 2021 at the time she filed her motion to void and thus, the motion to void the order must be granted.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The motion to void order CEL-00107-21 is granted.
 
2.     Orders CEL-00107-21 issued
on August 23, 2021 and CEL-00107-21-RV issued
on December 6, 2021 are void and cannot be enforced by the Landlord.
