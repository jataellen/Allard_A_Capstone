Review Order
 
Alex Loveday
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Crystal Gardiner and John Laframboise (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was resolved by order EAL-92327-20 issued on September 14, 2021. On
September 29, 2021, the Landlord requested a review of the order.
On October 1, 2021, interim
order EAL-92327-20-RV-IN was issued.
The request was heard by videoconference on December 20, 2021.
Only the Landlord’s Representative, Ahmad Alzameli attended
the review hearing.
The Tenants were properly
served with Notice.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord
did not receive the Notice of Hearing
and I find they did not have an
adequate opportunity to participate in the hearing held on June 25, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from October 1, 2020 to April 2,
2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October 23, 2020.
 
3.    
The Tenants vacated the
rental unit on April 2, 2021 which is the earliest date the Landlord could
have obtained possession of the rental
unit having been informed the Tenants vacated on April 1, 2021.

4.    
There is no last month rent deposit held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
The Tenants
were in possession of the rental
unit when the application
was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order EAL-92327-20
issued on September 14, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the following: The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated on April 2,
2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$4,839.23*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to April 2, 2021.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before
January 15, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from January 14,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
