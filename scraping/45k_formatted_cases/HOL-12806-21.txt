Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12806-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


507, 339 RATHBURN RD WEST
  MISSISSAUGA ON L5B0K6


 




Between:


Parminder Mander Hardevinder Mander


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Patrice Tantoh Sab


Tenant



 
 
 
On December 5, 2021, Parminder
Mander and Hardevinder Mander (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Patrice
Tantoh Sab (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant entered into an
agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlords and the Tenant
signed an agreement
to terminate the tenancy as of
January 31, 2022.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 31, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 31, 2022, then starting
February 1, 2022, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.




File Number: HOL-12806-21
 
 
 
 
3.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after February 1, 2022.

The tenant has until January 20, 2021 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under
s. 77(6) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 20, 2021 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction

has not been filed on or before
this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
