Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: SOL-77369-16











 
 

SW (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict RE (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Burlington on
February 10, 2017.  Only the Landlord and his
representative, DC, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The L1 application is
inconsistent with the N4 termination at its root.  The application will be
amended to reflect the monthly rent and arrears as claimed in the N4 notice.
2.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from September 11,
2016 to February 10, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a
Notice of Termination effective November 3, 2016.
3.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
4.     
While the Landlord requested
non-remedial termination of the tenancy even in the event that the Tenant pays
the arrears, the Act provides a right to void, and I do not have discretion to
remove that right.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The application is amended
to correct the monthly rent to $2,500.00.
2.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before February
25, 2017.
3.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $12,855.98*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to February 13, 2017.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $82.19 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
February 14, 2017 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
5.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $170.00 for the cost of filing the application.
6.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 25, 2017, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
February 26, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
7.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 25, 2017, then starting February 26, 2017, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
8.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 26, 2017.
9.     
If, on or before February
25, 2017, the Tenant pays the amount of $15,170.00** to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
10.   The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after February 26, 2017 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to
make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.

In accordance with
