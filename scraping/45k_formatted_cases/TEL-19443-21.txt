Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19443-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


0601, 1 ROSEMOUNT DRIVE TORONTO ON M1K2W5


 




Between:


Galaxy Real Estate
Core Ontario Properties LP


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Melissa Singh Shaddae Samms


Tenants



 
 
Galaxy Real Estate Core Ontario Properties LP (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Shaddae
Samms and Melissa
Singh (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 20, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Sharon Harris
attended the hearing.
As of 3:12 p:m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from July
1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August
25, 2021.
 
2.    The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    The lawful monthly
rent is $1,413.16.
 
4.   
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,338.58 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.    The Tenants paid $5,652.64 after the application was filed.
 
6.   
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental
unit on or before January 24, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$834.30*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January 13,
2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $46.46 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 14, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 24, 2022, the
Tenants will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 25, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 24, 2022, then starting January 25, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
January 25, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 24, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $3,125.48** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenants
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or
after January 25, 2022 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant
possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.

Toronto East-RO
2275 Midland
Avenue, Unit 2 Toronto ON M1P3E7
