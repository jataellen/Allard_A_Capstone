Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
 
File Number: TEL-06648-19
 
 
Y.J.W. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict R.M. and C.M.
(the 'Tenants') because they have been persistently late in paying their rent.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the
unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on February 11,
2020.
 
The Landlord and the first-named Tenant attended the hearing. The Landlord was represented
by M.J.Y.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
This is a month to month tenancy
in which the rent is due on the first of the month. The monthly rent for this unit
is $2,435.00. The rental unit is a four-bedroom house with a two-car garage. 
2.     
The Landlord’s L2 application
is based on a N8 notice of termination served to the Tenants on October 12, 2019 with a termination date of February
29, 2020 alleging that the Tenants have been
persistently late in paying their rent for the period from February 2019 to October
2019. 
3.     
The Landlord’s evidence was that
since the N8 notice of termination was served, the Tenants continued to pay the rent late for the months of
November 2019, December 2019 and February 2019. 
4.     
As such, the Landlord seeks a
termination of the tenancy and the reimbursement of the $175.00 
TENANT’S EVIDENCE
5.     
The Tenant does not dispute that
the rent was late most of the time for the period claimed by the Landlord. The Tenant
states that he lost his ten-year job in January 2019. Due to this, he had a hard
time with his financial obligations, but he never stopped paying the rent. 
6.     
On December 27, 2019, the Tenant
found a full-time job and started working. He seeks a chance to preserve his tenancy
and requests a conditional order as he is confident that he will not have any issues
paying the rent on time moving forward. This is supported by the fact that the rent
for January 2020 was paid on time. 
7.     
He lives in the rental unit with
his three daughters ages 18, 15, and 12 who stay with him for part of the week.
His ex lives in the area as well which makes it easier for his children to spend
time with both parents. 
8.     
With respect to the application
filing fee, the Tenant stated he could have this paid by March 5, 2020. 
9.     
As of the hearing date, the rent
for February 2020 remains unpaid; the Tenant testified that he could have the amount
paid by April 13, 2020 in three installments. He testified that he needed the extra
time because the money was used to pay off his car debt that was in arrears for
six months to BMW Financial Services. 
10.  
The Landlord’s response was that
they have been lenient with the Tenant since his brother lives in another one of
the Landlord’s units. This is an individual Landlord, not a corporation, who depends
on the Tenant ’s prompt payments to maintain their property. 
11.  
As of the date of the hearing,
the Landlord’s representative confirmed there was no default in the mortgage nor
was a loan taken by the Landlord as a result of the Tenant ’s late payments. 
12.  
While the Landlord prefers termination
of the tenancy, they are amenable to the proposal made by the Tenant for the filing
fee and the rent for February 2020. 
ANALYSIS 
13.  
Based on the evidence before
the Board I am satisfied that the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the
rent. I say this based on the Tenant ’s admission that the rent has been late for
most of the period claimed by the Landlord. 
14.  
With respect to the Tenant’s
request for relief in the form of a conditional order. I find his request to be
reasonable. The Tenant fell into hard times when he lost his job in January 2019,
however, he has managed to find another full-time employment and paid his rent for
January 2020 on time. 
15.  
I am concerned that the rent
for February 2020 was not paid on time, however, I find that the Tenant is able
to afford the rental unit as his evidence was that his monthly income is approximately
$6,000.00 and his expenses total $3,435.00 which is inclusive of his rent, car payment
and utilities. 
16.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant
relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. I will award the Tenant the
relief that he is seeking, namely a conditional order that would require him to
pay the rent on time for the next twelve months beginning May 2020 failing which
the Landlord may apply pursuant to section 78 for an order terminating the tenancy
if there is a breach.
17.  
This order contains all of
the reasons for my decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.   
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Tenants shall pay the rent
for February 2020 on or before April 13, 2020.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay the rent
for March 2020 on or before April 13, 2020.
3.     
The Tenants shall pay the rent
for April 2020 on or before April 1, 2020.
4.     
Commencing May 1, 2020 through
to April 30, 2021, the Tenants shall pay to the Landlord the rent in full and no
later than the first day of each month. 
5.     
If the Tenants fail to make
any one of the payments in accordance with this order, the Landlord may,
without notice to the Tenants, apply to the Board pursuant to section 78 of the
Act for an order terminating the tenancy. 
6.     
If they haven’t already, the
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application on or before April 5, 2020. 
7.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the amount in paragraph 6 of this order on or before April 5, 2020,
they will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from April
6, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
