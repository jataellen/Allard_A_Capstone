2.     
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on October 31, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the
date the application was filed.
 
3.     
The lawful
monthly rent was $1,125.00.
 
4.     
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,125.00 from the Tenant and this deposit

paid $250.00 after the application was filed.

shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
