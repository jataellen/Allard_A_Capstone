Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-56918-21
 
 



In the matter of:


485
  PARK STREET KITCHENER ON N2G1N7


 




Between:


Drew Dickinson


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Brianna Neidenbach


Tenant



 
 
 
Drew Dickinson (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Brianna Neidenbach (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant has been persistently late in paying
the Tenant's rent
 
This application
was heard via video conference on February 17, 2022. Only the Landlord’s legal representative, Jane Dean, attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Preliminary Issue
 
1.    
The sign-in process for the
hearing block began at 8:30am and the hearing was scheduled to start at 9:00am.
I waited until approximately 10:00am and I canvased the virtual hearing room,
the virtual reception area, the virtual waiting room and all of the breakout rooms to confirm
whether the Tenant
attended the hearing.
The Tenant’s name did not appear in any of these
areas, I was satisfied that the Tenant failed to attend the hearing and I
proceeded to hear the Landlord’s application as an uncontested matter.
 
2.    
At 2:39pm, the Tenant
appeared in the hearing room. I explained
to her that her matter had
been dealt with and she should seek legal advice to find
out her options. She then
left the hearing and did not return.
 
The Landlord’s Application
 
3.    
The Tenant has persistently failed
to pay the rent on
the date it was due. The Landlord’s application indicates
that the Tenant
has paid their rent late 10 out of 10 times since May
2021.




File Number: SWL-56918-21
 
4.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before March 7, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing on or before March 7, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 8, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 7, 2022, then starting March
8, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
5.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 8, 2022.
