Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-90711-18
 











 
 
 

 O.L.I o/a M.P.(the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict K.D. and J.C. (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on May 30, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative,
B.R., and the Tenants attended the hearing. 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent they were required to pay for the period from April 1, 2018 to
May 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective April 20, 2018.
2.     
The outstanding arrears
owing for the period ending May 31, 2018, total $2,687.44. 
3.     
The Landlord paid $190.00
for the costs of filing the application and the Landlord is entitled to be
reimbursed for those costs. 
4.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,199.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from December 1, 2011 to April 20, 2018,
in the amount of $146.40.
6.     
The Tenants live in the
rental unit with their five children ages 15, 13, 12, 9 and 8 years old. The
Tenants have lived in the rental unit since 2011 and the children all attend
school in the area. 
7.     
The second-named Tenant says
they fell into arrears due to a family trauma which consumed the family for at
least two months. Rather than pay their rent, the Tenant says the family chose
instead to ensure everyone was physically safe and were recovered from the
trauma. 
8.     
The Tenants’ financial
circumstances are somewhat unclear. In the hearing room, I researched the
Tenants’ history at the Board and discovered that the Landlord has filed
numerous applications for non-payment of rent over the duration of this
tenancy. However, it is not clear to me why the Tenants keep falling into
arrears, particularly since their joint monthly incomes more than pay for their
joint monthly expenses. Despite their seeming financial stability, the Tenant says
that she is caught in a “loan loop” in which she borrows $1,400.00 each month
from a money mart and then is forced to pay that amount back plus interest and
a substantial fee. 
9.     
The Landlord’s
representative says they have chased the Tenants enough for rent, they have
tried to work with the Tenants, but it is time for this tenancy to end. The
Tenants say they wish to vacate the rental unit but they would like the
children to finish their school year before they move out.
10.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). In particular, I have considered that this
is a long term tenancy and there are several young children in the rental unit
who are attending school in the area. Based on these circumstances, I find that
it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until June 30, 2018, pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before June 30,
2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $1,617.94*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to June 6, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $44.23 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting June 7, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 17, 2018, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June
18, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 30, 2018, then starting July 1, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 1, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before June 30,
2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $4,225.66** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after July 1, 2018
but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
