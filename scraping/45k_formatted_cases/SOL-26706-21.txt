In the
  matter of:


1602, 360 TORRANCE STREET BURLINGTON ON L7R2R9


 




Between:


1319399 Ontario Inc. c/o GWL Realty Advisors Residential Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Derryon John Woolcock


Tenant



 
 
 
1319399 Ontario Inc. c/o GWL
Realty Advisors Residential Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Derryon
John Woolcock (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay compensation for
damage the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the Board on November 5, 2021 with respect to
application SOL-20645-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following condition
specified in the order: the Tenant did not pay $118.65 on or
before November 15, 2021.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for compensation for damage caused by the Tenant and the resulting order required the Tenant to pay an amount for damage. Accordingly, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for
compensation for damage.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $1,372.50 for
compensation for damage and the costs related
to the Landlord's application fee in Order SOL-20645-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $1,132.50 and that amount
is included in this order.
As a result, the previous order SOL-20645-21 is cancelled.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The previous order SOL-20645-21 is cancelled.




File Number: SOL-26706-21
 
2.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 25, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $1,132.50*. This amount represents the unpaid compensation for damage and the costs related to the application fee for the previous
application.
 
4.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
25, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before January 25, 2022, then starting January
26, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 26, 2022.

The tenant has until January 24, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order

and the Board will schedule a hearing.
