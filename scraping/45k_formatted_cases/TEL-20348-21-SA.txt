Order under Section 77(8)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-20348-21-SA
 
 



In the matter
of:


BASEMENT, 73 HORSELEY HILL DRIVE
  SCARBOROUGH ON M1B1W4


 




Between:


Goutam Majumder
  Shumi Majumder


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Aneshia Fedee


Tenant



 
 
Goutam Majumder and Shumi
Majumder (the 'Landlords')
applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Aneshia Fedee
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant gave a notice
to terminate the tenancy.
That application was resolved by order TEL-20348-21 issued on November 29, 2021.
 
The Tenant filed a motion to set aside order TEL-20348-21.
 
This motion was heard by videoconference on February 10,
2022.
 
The Landlords and the Tenant attended
the hearing. The Landlords
were represented by Hagan
Turan. The Tenant was represented by Kevin LaForest.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
The Landlord’s L3 application
filed on October 27, 2021 was based on a N9 notice of termination signed by the
Tenant on September 1, 2021 with a termination date of November 30, 2021 pursuant
to subsection 77(1) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006.
 
PRELIMINARY ISSUE
 
2.   
At the hearing, the Tenant’s
representative raised a preliminary issue with respect to the validity of the
N9 notice of termination – specifically that it did not comply with the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 as it failed to identify the rental unit and
sought, on this basis, that the motion to set aside the order
be granted and the Landlord’s application be dismissed.
 
3.    The Tenant relies on three cases: EAL-19177-SA,
NOL-22245-16 and George V Apartment Ltd. v. Cobb, [2002]
O.J. No. 5918 and
submits that where the notice does not comply with the Act, it is rendered
invalid – notices of termination cannot be amended.




 
4.   
The Landlord submits that the
residential complex is a house in which the Tenant resides in the basement unit. The Landlord
resides on the main level.
The Landlord further
submits that the notice of termination identified the rental
unit as it is listed
as “73 HORSELEY HILL DRIVE”
and that it was understood by the parties that the Tenant was making
reference to the basement unit in which she resides.
 
5.    The Landlord’s representative submits that the case
law submitted by the Tenant’s representative differs from the particulars
before the Board as the Board cases EAL- 19177-SA and NOL-222465-16 both dealt
with the issue of coercion and intimidation whereas George V Apartment
Ltd. v. Cobb, [2002] O.J. No. 5918 dealt with a verbal notice of termination.
 
6.    The Landlord maintains
the position that the N9 provided was valid and that the preliminary motion should be
dismissed.
 
ANALYSIS
 
7.   
Section 43(1) of the Act states:
 
43 (1) Where this Act permits
a landlord or tenant to give a notice of termination, the notice shall be in a form
approved by the Board and shall,
 
(a)              
identify the rental unit for which the notice is given;
 
(b)              
state the date on which the tenancy is to terminate; and
 
(c)              
be signed
by the person giving the notice, or the person’s
agent. [Emphasis added.]
8.   
Based on the evidence before the
Board, it is undisputed that the Tenant resides in the basement unit. It is also undisputed that the rental unit
“basement” is not identified on the
N9 notice of termination that was given by the Tenant to the Landlords on
September 1, 2021. While the Landlord
submits that this was understood between the parties
– I do not find that this
“understanding” meets the mandatory requirements under the Act nor do I find it
equates to substantial compliance under section 212 of the Act.
 
9.   
In the case of Re
Bianchi and Aguanno, 1983 CanLII 1967 (ON SC), [1983] O.J. No. 3053, 42 O. R. (2d) 76, which was based on a landlords notice of
termination, the Ontario Divisional
Court dealt with the equivalent of section 43 of the Act, which was section 44
under the previous Landlord and Tenant Act and found that compliance
is mandatory and cannot be amended by the court. A notice of termination
contravening this section is void.
 
10. In the Divisional Court case of George V Apartment
Ltd. v. Cobb, [2002] O.J. No. 5918 which
was cited by the Tenant’s
representative, and which was based on a verbal notice
of termination, as correctly pointed out by the Landlord’s
representative, the court states at paragraph 15:
 
[15] More broadly, we find the
scheme of the Act should be applied with an even hand between landlord and tenant
when it comes to notices
of termination. Section




 
39(1) of the Act recites that a
tenancy may be terminated only in accordance with the Act. A tenant may
terminate a tenancy at the end of a period of the tenancy by giving notice of
termination to the landlord. (s. 46 of the Act) … Section 43(1) sets out the form of the notice that is to be given by either a landlord or a tenant.
We find the notice requirement
should apply equally to landlord and to tenant. There is nothing in the
legislation to suggest that a tenant's notice which fails to comply with the
provisions of the Act is other than void.
 
11. From the case law, I conclude that where a notice of termination does not comply
with the mandatory
requirements of the Act, it is deemed invalid. In the case before the Board, I find
that the N9 notice of termination fails to identify the rental unit,
contravening subsection 43(1)(a) of the Act and is rendered defective; as such,
the Tenant’s motion to set aside the order must be granted
and the Landlord’s L3 application must be dismissed.
 
12. This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The motion to set aside order TEL-20348-21 issued
on November 29, 2021 is granted.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s L3 application is dismissed.
