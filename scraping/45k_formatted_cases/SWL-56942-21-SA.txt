The Tricar Group (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Jordan Thomson (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on
May 13, 2021 with respect to application SWL-47565-20.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved by order SWL-56942-21, issued on January 5, 2022.
The Tenant filed a motion to set aside order SWL-56942-21.
 
This motion
was heard by videoconference on February 17, 2022 at 9:16am.
Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
At the hearing, the Landlord’s representative submitted that the Tenant had rectified the breach and as such, the Landlord
consented to the Tenant’s motion to set aside the order, sought to withdraw
their L4 application to have the original order
remain in effect.
 
2.    
As the Landlord’s request
benefits the Tenant,
in that it allows the preservation of the
tenancy, the Landlord’s request is granted.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     Order SWL-56942-21, issued
on January 5, 2022, is set aside.
