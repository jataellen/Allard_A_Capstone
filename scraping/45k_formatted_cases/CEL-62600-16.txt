Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006

In the matter
  of:


 


 




 


 


 




Between:


M H


Landlord




 


 


 




 


and


 




 


 


 




 


C K


Tenant




 


 


 



 
M H (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict C K (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (L1
Application).
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict C K (the 'Tenant') because:
1)   
she, another occupant
of the rental unit or someone she permitted in the residential complex has
wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has
also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for
the damage;
2)   
she, another occupant
of the rental unit or someone she permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant; 
3)   
she or another occupant
of the rental unit has committed an illegal act or has carried out, in the
rental unit or the residential complex (L2 Application). 
 
The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination
date.
 
These applications
were heard in Mississauga on January 5, 2017.
 
Only
the Landlord and Landlord's Legal Representative, F. O attended the hearing. 
L. de M (LD) was a Witness for the Landlord.
 
Determinations
and Reasons:
 
Regarding
L1 rent arrears application:
 
1.     
The Tenant
has not paid the total rent she was required to pay for the period from
September 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective November 5, 2016.
2.     
The Tenant
paid $5,280.00 after the application was filed.
L2 Application: N5 Substantial
Interference and Damages
3.     
There are
two units in a semi-detached home.  The Tenant lives on the main floor and
another tenant rents the basement unit.  The driveway is shared.
4.     
On October 27, 2016,
the Landlord served the Tenant with a first N5 Notice to End your Tenancy for
Interfering with Others, Damage or Overcrowding (N5 Notice) in accordance with
section 64(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). The N5
Notice has a termination date of November 17, 2016 and alleges that the conduct
of the Tenant substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the
residential complex and the Tenant has wilfully or negligently damaged the
rental unit or residential complex.
5.     
The N5 Notice sets out
the dates, times and specific allegations against the Tenant. 
6.     
Because this is a first
N5 Notice, the Tenant has an opportunity to void the notice in accordance with
section 64(3) of the Act by correcting the identified problems within seven
days of the date the notice was served. In this case, the seven day period begins
the day following service of the N5 Notice, from October 28th to
November 3rd, 2016. The Landlord's Legal Representative confirmed
that the first N5 Notice was not voided because the conduct has not
stopped since the notice was served and the Tenant has not paid $500.00
required to replace or replace the damaged property.
Window
screens
7.     
The Tenant
negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit and residential complex by
damaging the screens on two windows and the patio door. The photos submitted into
evidence support a finding of negligence because the screens were badly torn
which did not occur from usual wear and tear. The Landlord is entitled to the cost
claimed of $300.00 to repair the window screens.  The Landlord provided an
invoice to support this claim.
Conduct
issues
8.     
The conduct
of the Tenant substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the
Landlord and other tenant for the following reasons:
9.     
The City of
Mississauga issued a Notice of Contravention in April 2016 regarding debris
located on the property because of the Tenant’s failure to properly store her
garbage. A copy of the Notice was submitted;
10.  
The City of
Mississauga also informed the Landlord about a noise complaint because the
Tenant’s dog was barking for hours while left unattended in the backyard
disturbing the neighbours. The Landlord submitted a copy of this letter into
evidence; 
11.  
Based on
the testimony of the Landlord, the Tenant parks in the adjacent neighbour’s
driveway and the Landlord receives complaints from the neighbour;  
12.  
On August
29th the Tenant left her dog unattended in a common area of the
residential complex and the Landlord was unable to show the unit to prospective
renters.  The Tenant fails to respond to the Landlord’s requests to control her
dog. The Landlord submitted a text message sent to the Tenant regarding this
issue on October 27th; 
13.  
The Tenant
installed a lock on the gate to the shared backyard and refused to remove the
lock.  The Landlord submitted a text message sent to the Tenant on August 23rd
requesting a key to which the Tenant responded with foul language to leave her
alone. Consequently the Landlord changed the lock and provided the tenants with
keys;
14.  
The Tenant
changed the lock on the entry door to the basement unit without the Landlord’s
consent.  Section 35 of the Act specifies that a tenant shall not alter the
locking system on a door giving entry to a rental unit or residential complex
without the consent of the Landlord.  The Landlord is entitled to her costs for
installing a new lock of $200.00 which she supported with an invoice;
15.  
The Tenant
leaves her clothes in the laundry room and leaves kitty litter under the sink
such that it interferes with the use of the laundry room by the other tenant.
The Landlord has received numerous complaints from the other tenant regarding
inability to do laundry and despite the creation of a laundry schedule, the
issue continues.  Photos of the laundry room and text messages reporting the
issues were submitted into evidence;
16.  
The Tenant
plays loud music and makes excessive noise at late hours.  These incidents
occurred on November 21st, 25th and 29th and
continue on a regular basis.  The Tenant yells and swears at the Landlord and
the downstairs tenant.  In support of this testimony, the Landlord submitted
text messages. The downstairs tenant, LD testified about the ongoing issues
with interference with laundry, loud arguments with the tenant and the tenant’s
threat to turn her dog loose on him.  LD also played an audio of one of the
arguments in which the Tenant was heard yelling loudly and aggressively. He
said the Tenant also forced open the entry door to his unit in November and
began screaming at him.  LD called the police;  
17.  
LD also
testified that he complained to the City of Mississauga about the noise but the
Tenant’s behaviour continues.  He said he would move out if the Tenant
continues to live at the rental unit.
Illegal
Act (N6)
18.  
On October 27, 2016,
the Landlord served the Tenant with an N6 Notice to End your Tenancy for Illegal
Acts in accordance with section 61(1) of the Act. The N6 Notice has a
termination date of November 17, 2016 and alleges that the Tenant physically
assaulted the downstairs tenant on October 22, 2016.
19.  
The Tenant
committed an illegal act by placing her fingers on LD’s face and pushing him on
September 17th, 2016 which constitutes assault.  The police were
called. While the notice specified that an assault occurred on October 22nd,
2016 the testimony was that the conduct complained of occurred on September 17th.
However the notice provided the Tenant with sufficient details to understand
the allegation. 
Relief
from eviction
20.  
The
Landlord seeks eviction as soon as possible.  The other tenant intends to move
because of the unrelenting issues he experiences on a daily basis because of
the Tenant’s conduct. 
21.  
No
circumstances were disclosed in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act to
consider relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It
is ordered that:
 
1.     
The tenancy
between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of
the rental unit on or before January 29, 2017.
2.     
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord $1,012.21*, which represents the amount of rent owing
and compensation up to January 18, 2017, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant
shall pay also to the Landlord $500.00, which represents the reasonable costs
of repairing the damage and replacing the damaged property.
4.     
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $170.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $57.86 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 19, 2017 to the date she moves out of the unit.
6.     
If the
Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January
29, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from January 30, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
7.     
If the unit
is not vacated on or before January 29, 2017, then starting January 30, 2017,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
8.     
Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 30,
2017.
