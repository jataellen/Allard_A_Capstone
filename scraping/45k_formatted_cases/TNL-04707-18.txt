Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-04707-18
 










 
 
 

MG
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict CM
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges.
 
This
application was heard in Newmarket on June 14, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Landlord’s Representative, PC attended the
hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the
Tenant was required to pay for the period from May 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018. 
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
May 3, 2018.
2.     
The Landlord waived their right to collect
any amount of arrears in excess of $25,000.00 which is the jurisdictional limit
of the Board. 
3.     
The Landlord incurred charges of $7.00 for
cheques tendered by or on behalf of the Tenant, which were returned NSF.
4.     
I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out
below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The
Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before June 30, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$25,007.00*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to
June 19, 2018 and the total charges related to a NSF cheque tendered to the
Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
4.     
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before June 30, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe
interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from July 1, 2018 at 3.00%
annually on the balance outstanding.
5.     
If the unit is not vacated on or before June 30,
2018, then starting July 1, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
6.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord, on or after July 1, 2018.
7.     
If, on or before June 30, 2018, the Tenant pays
the amount of $25,182.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy would not be terminated
and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this payment is not made in full
and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.     
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after July 1, 2018 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make
this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
