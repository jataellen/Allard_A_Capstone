Review Order
 
J.R.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict C.R.
and J.R. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This
application was resolved by order TEL-80518-17 issued on June 21, 2017.
 
On
January 24, 2018, the Tenants requested a review of the order.
 
The
request was heard in Whitby on February 2, 2018. 
 
The Landlord and the second-named Tenant attended the hearing. 
 
Preliminary Issue:
 

At
     the hearing, the Tenant requested an adjournment because his legal
     representative was not with him and he was not prepared to proceed. 
Even
     though this is the Tenants’ request for review, and the original hearing
     took place on June 19, 2017, the Tenant could not explain why he was
     ill-prepared or why his legal representative was not able to assist him. 
The
     Landlord objected to the Tenant’s request for an adjournment because the
     arrears are already quite substantial and this matter has already been
     ongoing for over 7 months. 
At
     the hearing, I denied the Tenant’s request for an adjournment. However, I
     allowed the Tenant 30 minutes to speak with Duty Counsel to ensure that he
     felt as prepared as possible. 

Determinations:
The
Review Request
5.    The
Landlord and the Tenant are brothers. The Tenant says he was not reasonably
able to participate in the hearing that took place on June 19, 2017, because he
did not receive the notice of hearing. 
6.    The
Landlord says that, even if the Tenant did not receive the notice of hearing,
he should have been aware of the hearing because the Landlord passed a message
through their father to advise the Tenant about the upcoming hearing. The
Landlord admits that he did not follow up to confirm whether the message had
been relayed, and the Tenant denies ever receiving this message.  The
Landlord’s father was not present at the hearing to answer questions regarding
the alleged message. 
7.    Based
on the evidence before me, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that
the Tenant did not receive the notice of hearing and was not reasonably able to
participate in the June 19, 2017, hearing. 
8.    The
Tenant’s request for review is granted. 
The
Application for Non-Payment of Rent
9.    The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from June 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective May 18, 2017.
10. The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending February 28, 2018, total $44,600.00.
11. The
Landlord incurred costs as a result of filing the application in the amount of
$190.00 and is entitled to reimbursement for those costs. 
12. The
Tenant disputes the amount of outstanding arrears because he says he and the
Landlord never had an agreement to pay a fixed amount of monthly rent. In
response, the Landlord provided the Board with order TEL-67724-16 issued on May
16, 2016. In that order, the Member heard testimony and reviewed documentary
evidence regarding the issue of the amount of monthly rent. The Member found
that the parties did, in fact, have an agreement to a fixed amount of monthly
rent in the amount of $1,600.00.
13. As
I explained to the parties at the hearing, as the issue of the quantum of
monthly rent has previously been decided, and as per the doctrine of res
judicata, I am prevented from hearing that issue again. The parties are in
a landlord-tenant relationship and the monthly rent is $1,600.00. 
14. There
is no dispute between the parties that the Tenant and his wife can afford the
rental unit and can afford to pay the significant outstanding arrears. The
Tenant is requesting a delay of 5 days so that he can speak to his lawyer and gather
the necessary funds. The Landlord is agreeable to this request. 
15. I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). In
particular, I have considered the fact that the Landlord consents to delaying
this eviction by five days and I and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until February 28, 2018, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b)
of the Act.
The
Board’s Monetary Jurisdiction
16. The
amount claimed by the Landlord exceeds the monetary jurisdiction of the Board.
Section 207(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’), limits the
monetary jurisdiction of the Board to that of the Small Claims Court. At this
time that amount is $25,000.00. 
17. The
Landlord was advised of this limitation and agreed to waive any amount that
exceeds the Boards monetary jurisdiction. The Landlord was also advised of
section 207(3) which states if the party allows the Board to proceed and order
any amount up to the maximum amount that party extinguishes the right in excess
of the Board’s monetary jurisdiction. The Landlord acknowledged this and agreed
to allow the Board to determine the amount, if any, that is outstanding and
issue an order accordingly. 
It
is ordered that:
1.      Order
TEL-80518-17 issued on June 21, 2017 is cancelled and replaced by the
following: Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out
of the rental unit on or before February 28, 2018.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $25,000.00*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to February 6, 2018.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $52.60 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 7, 2018 to the date they move out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2018, then starting March 1,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
6.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2018.
7.  If, on or
before February 28, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $33,790.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced. This amount exceeds the monetary jurisdiction of the
Board. This is an amount that the Tenant can choose to pay if they choose not
to vacate the rental unit. The Board is not ordering this amount to be paid.
This amount is optional and only required if the Tenants elect to remain in the
rental unit. Therefore, the Board is not ordering this amount to be paid and is
not ordering an amount that exceeds the limit. 
8.  The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after March 1, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
