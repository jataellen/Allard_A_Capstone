Rob Elisen,
Carol Ann Elisen and Elisen Farms Ltd. (the 'Landlords') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy
and evict Lyle Fletcher and Molly Fletcher
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 6, 2022. Only one of the Landlords,
Carol Ann Elisen, attended the hearing. As of 10:10 a.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from April 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because of the arrears,
the Landlords served a Notice
of Termination effective September 18, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
vacated the rental unit on November 2, 2021. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,000.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
is not holding a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants paid $4,300.00 after
the application was
filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of November
2, 2021, the date the Tenants returned
vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlords.

for the cost of filing the application.

do not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before January
