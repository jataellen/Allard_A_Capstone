In the matter
of:


37, 786 SHELBORNE STREET LONDON ON N5Z4Y5


 




Between:


London Non-profit Multicultural Residences


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Chantel Blair


Tenant



 
 
 
London
Non-profit Multicultural Residences (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Chantel
Blair (the 'Tenant') because
they, another occupant of the rental unit or
someone the Tenants permitted in the residential complex has substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another tenant.
 
This
application was heard via videoconference on January 10, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s legal agent, K. Jennings,
witness, M. Sutherland, and legal representative, T. Schoenleber, attended
the hearing. As of 12:08 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict the Tenant because she, another occupant
of the rental unit or someone he permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another
tenant. The Landlord had served with the Tenant with two N5 notices. The first
N5 had a termination date was August 20, 2021 and the second had a termination
date of September 16, 2021.
 
2.    
The first N5 notice alleges that
on various dates, the Tenant parked her vehicle on the walkway and grass, tore
up paving stones on the rear patio, left her dog unattended and tied to the hydro
box, and the front of her unit was
cluttered and unclean. K.
Jennings, the superintendent, testified to these events
and submitted into evidence photographs of each of these events. M. Sutherland testified that
she lives a few houses away
from the Tenant and she observed the Tenant’s car on the front lawn regularly.
 
3.    
The second N5 notice alleges that
on August 12, 2021 the front of the Tenant’s unit remained unclean and on
August 23, 2021, the Tenant parked her vehicle on the grass.




 
Law and Analysis re: N5 Notices
 
4.    
Subsection 64 (1) of the Act states:
 
A landlord
may give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy
if the conduct of the tenant, another occupant of the rental
unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the tenant is such
that it substantially interferes with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex for all usual purposes
by the landlord or another tenant or substantially
interferes with another lawful right, privilege or interest of the landlord or
another tenant. 2006, c. 17, s. 64
(1).
 
5.     Based on the uncontested evidence of the Landlord’s
superintendent and the Tenant’s neighbour, I find that the Tenant substantially
interfered with the Landlord and other tenants’ reasonable enjoyment. K.
Jennings testified that the Tenant is obstructing the walkway for children and
other pedestrians by parking her car on the walkway and grass. The patio had
recently been renovated but the Tenant removed the patio stones. The Tenant’s dog lunged at other tenants
and defecated on the lawn while tethered
to the hydro box. Further, in the front of the Tenant’s unit there was large amounts
of garbage, food and
animal feces. As such, I find that the first N5 notice is valid.
 
Second N5 Notice
6.     The Landlord served
a subsequent N5 notices. Subsection 68(1) of the Act states
that: A landlord may give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy
if,
(a)  
a
notice of termination was given to the tenant under section
62, 64 or 67; and
(b)  
more than seven days but less than
six months after the notice mentioned in clause (a) was given to the tenant, an
activity takes place, conduct occurs or a situation arises that constitutes grounds for a notice of termination under
section 60, 61, 62, 64 or 67, other than an activity, conduct
or a situation that is described
in subsection 61 (1) and that involves
an illegal act, trade, business
or occupation described in
clause 61 (2) (a). 2006, c. 17, s. 68
(1); 2017, c. 13, s. 12.
 
7.     I accept the uncontested testimony of the Landlord’s witnesses, and find that the Landlord proved, on a balance of
probabilities, that the Tenant substantially interfered with the Landlord's and
the other tenants' reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex by
continuing to have clutter in the front of her unit and parking on the grass.
K. Jennings testified that while the Tenant removed food and animal feces from
the front of her unit, it is still unclean and new items appeared on her front
porch. The items included an air conditioner, a dresser, clothing, large water
bottles, garbage bags, dog food and bags of dirt. K. Jennings received
complaints from the neighbour immediately beside the Tenant regarding the
clutter. Further, the Tenant continues to obstruct the walkway for children and
other pedestrians by parking her car on the walkway and grass.
 
Section 83 Considerations




 
8.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
9.     The Landlord was not aware of any of the Tenant’s
circumstances for me to consider denying or delaying eviction. The Tenant did
not attend the hearing to testify to her circumstances to consider denying or
delaying eviction.
 
10.  The Landlord submitted
that the Tenant’s
behaviour has continued since August 2021; for
example, the front porch remains
cluttered and she planted a garden in an area where not permitted. It appears that the Tenant’s
conduct has been ongoing and disruptive. As such,
I find that relief should not be granted.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated, as of February 7, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit
on or before February 7, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing on or before February 7, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 8, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
4.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 7, 2022, then starting February
8, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
5.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord on or after February 8, 2022.
