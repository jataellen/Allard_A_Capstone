In the matter
of:


3, 206 KING

ST CATHARINES ON L2R3J7


 




Between:

Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Julie Lebouthillier


Tenant



 
 
 
Mohamed Sarhan and 206 Catharines
Capital Inc (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Julie Lebouthillier (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant
of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex
has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage
to the premises. The Landlords has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlords for the
damage; and because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered
with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlords or another tenant.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on January 19, 2022.
The Landlords and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The conduct related to the incident of June 1, 2021
that gave rise to the second N5 Notice of Termination, served under s.68 (1)(b)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), occurred less then seven
after the first N5 Notice was served.
The first Notice of Termination issued on May 28,
2021 was not voided. The second notice cannot be used as a first notice as there is
no ability to void. As such, the Landlord’s application for eviction is not considered.
 
Damage claim under section
89 of the Act:
 
2.     The Tenant does not dispute her guest broke the lock
and door when he pushed and forced it open to
test the security
of the door. The Tenant is responsible for the conduct of her guest who wilfully and
negligently caused undue damage to the entry door of the rental unit.




File Number: SOL-25307-21
 
3.    
The Landlord’s application for costs to replace the door is unsupported by enough
evidence and is unreasonable because of the following:
 
4.     The Tenant has repaired the door by replacing the
locking device and installing metal plates where the locking device
is situated and along the seam of the upper
portion of the old door. The Landlord said nothing about the integrity of the door after
the repairs were made.
 
5.     The Landlord wants to replace the door to improve the
aesthetics of the unit. Replacement costs considered are not those that are
meant to put the Landlord into a position where the condition of the door he
wants to purchase is better than what was damaged. In this case, the existing
door is very old, and costs
do not factor in fair market
value nor did the Landlord provide reasonable estimates for the work and
material to replace the property still outstanding.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
