Landlord




 


and


 




 


Valerie Doyle
  Wyatt Doyle


Tenants



 
 
 
Donald Vautour (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Wyatt Doyle and Valerie Doyle (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord
requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 18, 2022.
 
Only the
Landlord and the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Roderic McRandall, attended
the hearing. As of 11:22 a.m., the Tenants
were not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
Determinations:
 
1.     For the reasons
that follow, I find that the Landlords’ application requiring
possession of the rental unit for the
purpose of residential occupation pursuant to the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the ‘Act’) cannot proceed as one of the mandatory requirements under
the Act has not been met.
 
2.     The Landlord served
the Tenant with a Notice
to Terminate a Tenancy at the End of the Term for Landlord’s Own Use (the
‘N12’), on July 8, 2020. The N12 notice gave a termination date of September 5,
2020. The N12 notice indicates the Landlord requires the rental unit for the
Landlord, Priscilla Addo’s, own use.
 
3.     Section 48 of the Act says:
 
(1)   
A landlord may, by notice, terminate a tenancy if the landlord in good
faith requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation for a period of at least one year by,
 
(a)         
the landlord;




 
(b)         
the landlord’s spouse;
 
(c)          
a child or parent of the landlord
or the landlord’s spouse; or
 
(d)         
a person who provides or will provide
care services to the landlord,
the landlord’s spouse, or a child or parent
of the landlord or the landlord’s spouse,
if the person receiving the care services resides or will reside in the building, related group of buildings, mobile home park or
land lease community in which the rental unit is located.
 
(2)   
The date for termination specified
in the notice shall be at least 60 days after the notice is given and shall be the day a period of the tenancy
ends or, where the tenancy is for a fixed term, the end of the term.
 
4.     On an application for eviction for landlord’s own use there are
two issues before the Board:
 
i)                   
Have the mandatory requirements of the Act been satisfied in terms of the
notice of termination (s. 48), the compensation payable (s.48.1), and the
affidavit that must be filed with the application (s. 71,1(2)); and,
 
ii)                 
Does the individual who the Landlord
says wants to live in the rental
unit genuinely intend to move in and live there for at least a year.
 
5.     Section 48.1 of the Act requires a landlord who has
served an N12 notice to give the tenant compensation in the amount
of one month of rent.
Section 55.1 of the Act requires
a landlord who is obligated to give compensation to a tenant under s.48.1 to
pay that compensation no later than the termination date in the N12 notice.
 
6.     Here the mandatory requirements with respect to the
notice itself and the affidavit have been met.
However, based on the Landlord’s testimony the compensation has not been paid.
 
7.     Therefore, the Landlord has not complied with all of
the mandatory requirements under the Act, and the Landlord’s application must be dismissed.
An order will issue for same.
 
8.     As the application is dismissed, it is not necessary to deal with issue (ii) in this order
or the late filing of the affidavit.
 
9.     This order contains
all the reasons for the decision within
it. No further reasons shall
be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
