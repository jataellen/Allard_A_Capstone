Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-25642-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


2,
772 UPPER PARADISE ROAD HAMILTON ON L9C5P9


 




Between:


Cityhousing Hamilton Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Alexis McGillivray


Tenant



 
 
 
Cityhousing Hamilton Corporation
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Alexis McGillivray (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 15, 2022. The Landlord’s Legal Representative, Katherine Howlett
and the Tenant, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from August 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 1, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
As of November 1, 2021,
the monthly rent for the unit increased
to $1,170.00, as a parking spot was added.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,158.58 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021 to September 1, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $5,830.00 after
the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until March 15, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.




File Number: SOL-25642-21
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 15, 2022.
 
2.    
As of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the Landlord is entitled to by $296.99*.
 
3.     However, the Landlord
is authorized to offset
the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenant: $37.81 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 25,
2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit, and
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
The Landlord
or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 15, 2022, then starting March 16, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 16, 2022.
 
7.     If
the Tenant wishes
to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$1,336.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022,
or
ii)             
$2,506.00 if the payment
is made on or before March 15, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.    
The Tenant may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after March
16, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
