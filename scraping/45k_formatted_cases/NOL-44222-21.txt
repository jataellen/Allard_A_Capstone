Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44222-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


MAIN FLOOR
UNIT 1, 30 RUTLAND STREET WARREN ON P0H2N0


 




Between:


Christine Cauchy
  Donald Cauchy


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Michelle Hache


Tenant



 
 
 
Christine Cauchy and Donald
Cauchy (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Michelle
Hache (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 20, 2022.
 
The Landlord, Christine Cauchy,
the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Jennifer
Murray, and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     At the hearing,
the Tenant presented a notice from the Landlord
which stated that as long as the Tenant vacates the rental
unit by October 31, 2021, all outstanding rent arrears would be waived.
 
2.    
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on October
31, 2021 as per the
notice.
 
3.    
The Landlord’s Legal Representative claimed that the Tenant did not inform the Landlord that the Tenant
accepted the offer
to leave on October 31, 2021, and therefore, still owed
the outstanding arrears of $2,201.00.
 
4.     The Tenant added that there was no stipulation in the
notice to for the Tenant to inform the Landlord about accepting the offer. The notice only stated that the Tenant
must leave in order to have
the arrears forgiven.
 
5.     In this matter,
I find that the Tenant
vacated the rental
unit as per the Landlord’s notice and does not owe any arrears to the Landlord.




File Number: NOL-44222-21
