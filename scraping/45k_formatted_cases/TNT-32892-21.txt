Order under Section 31
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNT-32892-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


101, 35 35 JANSUSIE ROAD
ROAD ETOBICOKE ON M9W4V4


 




Between:


Leena Kothari
  Piyush Ranka


Tenants




 


 
and


 




 


Metcap Living


Landlords



 
 
 
Leena Kothari and Piyush Ranka
(the 'Tenants') applied for an order determining that Metcap Living (the
'Landlord') harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with them
and substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the
Tenants or by a member of their household.
 
This application was heard
via videoconference on February 10,
2022.
 
The second-named Tenant, the Landlord’s legal
representative, Michelle Forrester, and the Landlord’s
witness, Marites Estolas, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Preliminary Issue
 
1.   
The Landlord brought forward a
motion to dismiss the Tenants’ application because allegations contained
in the application occurred prior
to the one-year limitation period outlined in subsection 29(2) of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').
 
2.    The Tenant confirmed that alleged incidents occurred
in July 2017 and they filed their application
on June 14, 2021. This
is a four-year gap from the cause of action
to when the application was filed with the Board.
 
3.    As the allegations contained in the Tenants’ application fall outside the one-year time limitation required by the Act, the
Board does not have the jurisdiction to hear those allegations and the Tenants’
application must be dismissed.
