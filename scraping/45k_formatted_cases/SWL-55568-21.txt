Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55568-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


509, 1666
OUELLETTE AVENUE WINDSOR ON
  N8X4V2


 




Between:


Ira
  Udaskin
Marine City Apartments


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Accan Lewis Bill
Campbell


Tenant



 
 
Ira Udaskin and Marine City
Apartments (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Accan Lewis
(the ‘Tenant’) because: the Tenant,
another occupant of the rental
unit or a person the Tenant permitted in the residential complex seriously
impaired the safety of any person; and, the Tenant,
another occupant of the rental
unit or someone
they permitted in the
residential complex have wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the
premises. The Landlord also applied for an order for compensation in relation
to the damage.
 
This application was heard on
November 12, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord Ira Udaskin and the Landlord’s witness and superintendent Bill Campbell
attended the hearing.
 
The Tenant was not present or represented by 9:34 a.m. or at any other time during
the hearing block although
properly served with notice of the hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord issued
an N7 notice of termination with a termination date of October
17, 2021 under the following provisions of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’):
 
63 (1) Despite section
62, a landlord may give a tenant
notice of termination of the tenancy that
provides a termination date not earlier than the 10th day after the notice is
given if the tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person whom the
tenant permits in the residential complex,
 
(a)    
wilfully causes undue damage to the rental unit or the residential
complex; . . .
 
66 (1) A landlord
may give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy
if,




 
(a)    
an act or omission of the tenant,
another occupant of the rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex
by the tenant seriously impairs
or has seriously impaired the safety of any person; and
 
(b)    
the act or omission
occurs in the residential complex.
 
2.    
The allegations particularized on the N7 are that the Tenant damaged the fire alarm on the 5th floor of
the residential complex and then threw garbage from his balcony down onto the fire department responders on August 21, 2021 and that the Tenant
assaulted Mr. Campbell on October 1, 2021.
 
3.     Mr. Campbell’s evidence
was uncontested and I accepted
it as being true.
 
4.     Mr. Campbell testified that the 5th floor fire alarm sounded
on August 21, 2021, that he went to the 5th floor to investigate the cause of the alarm and that
he found no smoke or fire. However, when the fire department attended, he observed the Tenant throwing
items from his balcony at the fire department responders and that the
Tenant was yelling at the responders that they weren’t doing their job. Mr.
Campbell testified that he called the police and that the Tenant was charged
with assault.
 
5.     The Divisional Court decisions in Furr v. Courtland Mews Cooperative Housing
Inc., 2020 ONSC 1175
(CanLII) and Musse v. 6965083 Canada Inc., 2021 ONSC 1085 (CanLII)
affirm the principle that
impairment includes both actual impairment and a real risk of impairment. In my view, there is no doubt that the Tenant seriously impaired the safety
of the fire department responders when he threw items
at them from his balcony.
There is a real risk that the responders could
have been injured by these items. As this conduct occurred in the residential
complex, the Landlord has proven this ground of termination on the balance of
probabilities.
 
6.     Mr. Campbell also testified that he reviewed the
security footage of the 5th floor and observed the Tenant pulling the fire alarm for no proper purpose
on August 21, 2021. He explained that the Tenant’s actions
broke the toggle switch, which resulted in Mr. Campbell calling a company to
effect an emergency repair. The cost of this repair was
$1,173.84, inclusive of taxes.
Mr. Campbell supported this testimony with an invoice confirming that the Landlord paid
$1,173.84 to Performance Fire Protection.
 
7.     The Landlord’s evidence satisfied me that the Tenant
wilfully caused undue damage to the residential complex. The Tenant’s conduct
in activating the fire alarm and breaking the toggle switch was a wilful act.
As there was no fire, the broken switch cannot be described as normal wear and
tear or anything other than undue damage. As this conduct occurred
on the 5th floor of the residential complex,
the Landlord has proven this ground of termination on the balance
of probabilities.
 
8.     With respect to the incident of October 1, 2021, I
accepted Mr. Campbell’s uncontested evidence
to the effect that he was working
on the 8th floor of the residential complex
when the Tenant approached him, grabbed Mr. Campbell’s legs and clamped
himself onto the Mr. Campbell’s body. He
explained that the Tenant held this position for about 7-minutes,
that the Tenant was screaming at him throughout and that Mr. Campbell could not
move




 
without risking hurting himself
or the Tenant. Although Mr. Campbell was not hurt, the
Tenant’s actions created a real risk of serious impairment to both himself and
Mr.
Campbell. Mr. Campbell was
effectively immobilized at his legs and there was a real risk that Mr. Campbell could have fallen and injured
himself or the Tenant if he took any steps to remove himself from the
situation. As this conduct occurred in the residential
complex, the Landlord has proven this ground of termination on the balance of
probabilities.
 
9.    
The Landlord’s claim for $1,173.84 under subsection 89(1) of the Act, as it was when the Landlord filed the application, is
also granted:
 
89 (1) A landlord may apply to
the Board for an order requiring a tenant to pay reasonable costs that the
landlord has incurred or will incur for the repair of or, where repairing is
not reasonable, the replacement of damaged property, if the tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or
a person whom the tenant permits in the residential complex wilfully or
negligently causes undue damage to the rental unit or the residential complex
and the tenant is in possession of the rental unit.
 
10.  As noted above,
I have found that the Tenant wilfully
damaged the fire alarm by pulling it for no proper purpose. I also accept that the $1,173.84 in costs
incurred by the Landlord were reasonable in the circumstances.
 
11.  The monthly rent is $950.00. The Landlords collected a
rent deposit of $950.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlords. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period
from December 1, 2019 to October 17, 2021
 
12.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
13.  Although this inquiry requires me to consider the
circumstances of both parties, the Tenant did not attend the hearing and the
Landlord was not aware of any circumstances that would favour refusal of or
postponement of eviction. Additionally, Mr. Campbell testified that despite the
issuance of the N7 the Tenant has continued to engage in conduct that creates a real risk of a serious impairment of safety and that causes
damage to the residential complex. The Tenant has removed light
receptacles in the hallway of the
residential complex, broken several switches in the residential complex,
removed the smoke detector in the rental unit from the wall, and damaged an
exterior door. Although this led to orders by the Electrical Safety Authority,
and although the Landlord complied with these orders by doing the required
repair work, the Tenant subsequently disassembled electrical outlets in the
residential complex leaving wires exposed. This suggests to me that the Tenant
is not likely to comply with an order providing conditional relief from
eviction. In the circumstances, it would be unfair to grant relief from
eviction.
 
It is
ordered that:




 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlords and the
Tenant is terminated. The Tenant
must move out of the rental unit on or before February 27, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $1,173.84, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damaged property.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $3,025.64, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from October 18, 2021
to February 22, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on
the rent deposit. The Tenant is entitled to deduct from this amount any
payments already made to the Landlord for this period.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlords $31.23 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from February 23, 2022 to
the date they move out of the unit.
 
5.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing on or before February 27, 2022,
they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 28, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
7.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 27, 2022, then starting
February 28, 2022, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
8.    
Upon receipt of this order, the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after
February 28, 2022. The Sheriff is requested to expedite the
enforcement of this order.
