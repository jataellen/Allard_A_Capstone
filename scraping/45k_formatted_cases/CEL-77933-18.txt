Order under Section 69
and 30
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 











 
 

PW (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict KB (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes (L1 Application).
 
The Tenant also applied for an order determining that
the Landlord failed to meet the Landlord's maintenance obligations under the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') or failed to comply with health, safety,
housing or maintenance standards (T6 Application).
 
This application was heard in Mississauga on September
11, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Bias
1.     
Near the conclusion of the
hearing, the Tenant said that he felt I was biased toward him because I allowed
the Landlord to read his emails in response to the Tenant’s evidence regarding
the Tenant’s applications and that I did not permit him to read his emails.
2.     
A reasonable apprehension of bias requires a
“real likelihood or probability of bias”.  The test is an objective one, viewed
from the perspective of an informed and reasonable observer.  It is a high
burden (Stuart Budd & Sons Limited v. IFS Vehicle Distributors ULC
2016 ONCA 60).
3.     
Pursuant to section 25.0.1 of the Statutory
Powers Procedure Act, the Board has the power to determine its own
procedures.
4.     
Section 183 of the Act requires the Board to
adopt the most expeditious method of determining questions arising in a proceeding
which affords a party an adequate opportunity to be heard.
5.     
In Barzi v. Maragos 2017 ONSC 3183, the
Court confirmed that the Board is entitled to control its own procedure.  In
that case, the tenants asserted that the manner the hearing was conducted
demonstrated bias because the Board required the tenants to adduce their
evidence first and controlled the manner in which the evidence was received.
6.     
After considering the submissions from the Tenant,
I do not find that a reasonable and well informed person would conclude that
there is a reasonable apprehension of bias.  Prior to commencing hearing of the
Tenant’s application, I asked the Tenant to confirm the list of issues he
intended to present at the hearing.  I also asked him several times if he had
presented evidence about all his issues and I also admitted relevant evidence
he submitted including photos and a string of text messages.  Therefore the
Tenant had an adequate opportunity to be heard and the fact that I did not
allow him to read his text messages does not constitute a reasonable
apprehension of bias.  The Tenant had an adequate opportunity to submit
relevant portions of his text messages.
Regarding L1
rent arrears application 
7.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from July 1, 2018 to
September 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective July 26, 2018.
8.     
The amount owing to
September 30, 2018 is $2,715.00.  The Tenant does not dispute the amount owing.
9.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $905.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by
the Landlord.
10.  
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from March 30, 2015 to July 26, 2018.
Regarding Tenant’s T6 (maintenance) application
11.  
The Tenant rents a one
bedroom unit in the basement of a house.  The monthly rent is $905.  The
tenancy commenced as of April 1, 2014.  
The Law
12.  
Section 20(1) of the Act
obligates a Landlord to maintain a unit in a good state of repair.
13.  
In Onyskiw v. CJM
Property Management, 2016 ONCA 477, the Court of Appeal determined that a
contextual approach should be adopted when considering a landlord’s potential
breach of subsection 20(1) of the Act and a breach will not be found if the
landlord’s response to a maintenance issue was reasonable in the circumstances.
14.  
I must also apply subsection
30(2) of the Act, and consider whether the tenant advised the landlord of the
alleged breaches before applying to the Board, and the parties’ duty to
mitigate found in section 16 of the Act.
Basement windows
15.  
There are two windows in the
basement which the Tenant testified are not large enough to use as an emergency
exit.  He also testified that one of the windows is improperly sealed and
permits cold air and moisture to enter. The Tenant sent the Landlord a message
on November 8, 2017 about concerns regarding heat loss. The Tenant told the
Landlord about the leaking window on July 3, 2018.  The Landlord cleaned up
debris outside the window to alleviate leaking on July 6, 2018 and window was
replaced on July 20, 2018.  
16.  
The Tenant did not provide
sufficient evidence that there is a breach under section 20 of the Act
regarding the size of the basement windows.  The Landlord replaced the leaking
basement window in a reasonable amount of time and in accordance with Onyskiw
there is no breach of section 20.  The Tenant reported the issue on July 3rd
and the window was replaced two and one half weeks later.  The Landlord took
steps on July 6th to clear debris from the window well and divert
roof water away from the window to minimize any leak until the window was
replaced.  The window was scheduled to be replaced on July 14th
however the contractor delayed the installation to July 20th because
of rain.  This claim is dismissed.
Insulation
17.  
The Tenant’s claim that
exposed insulation in the furnace room is toxic is dismissed.  The Tenant did
not provide sufficient evidence to support his claim.  The Landlord said there
is only sound proofing material in the furnace room which is not unsafe.
Water leaks, mould
18.  
The Tenant testified that there
are airborne mould spores in the unit because of water damage in the subfloor. 
He said there is a pungent odour in the entire unit as of January 2018.  The
Tenant displayed dark staining on the lower part of a wall in the living room
which he said is mould. He submitted photos of the laminate flooring which shows
dark staining and also submitted a photo of his DVD player which he said
sustained water damage. 
19.  
In early November 2017, a
pipe leaked behind the closet wall.  The Tenant said he shut off the water and
reported the issue to the Landlord who repaired the pipe a few hours later. 
The Tenant said there have been six further leaks in the unit including on
August 9th and August 17th. The Tenant claims damage to
personal property including a DVD player, Xbox, DVD/CDs, comforters, couch legs
and computer drives because of the leaks.
20.  
The Landlord testified that after
the closet pipe leak, there was a second leak on August 9th because
of a rain storm.  A contractor attended the unit on August 13th to investigate
the source of the leak and found a foundation crack.  The wall had to be
completely dry to seal the leak and repair was delayed until August 20th
because of heavy rains on August 16th and 17th.  The
Landlord instructed the Tenant to keep a fan and dehumidifier running and use a
towel to contain the moisture.  The Landlord said his contractor advised him
that the fan and dehumidifier were turned off twice when he came to the unit.
21.  
The Landlord did not breach
section 20 regarding the pipe leak in the closet and the foundation leak.  The
Landlord responded reasonably and promptly and the evidence does not
demonstrate that the Landlord could have known about either leak which resulted
from a pipe behind the wall and a foundation crack behind drywall. The Landlord
repaired the first leak in the closet pipe promptly.  The Landlord’s contractor
came to the unit on August 13th (regarding the August 9th
leak) and August 20th regarding the foundation crack.  The
contractor confirmed there was one foundation crack as of September 1st
and the crack was repaired on September 9th, 2018.  The Landlord
submitted an invoice from Shape Carpentry dated September 10th to
support the completion of the repair. As any damage to the Tenant’s property
was not caused by the Landlord’s failure to comply with his obligation to
maintain the rental unit, the Landlord is not responsible for these costs. 
Furthermore, the amount of water leaking into the unit was minimal and did not
present a substantial impact to the Tenant.
22.  
However the Landlord failed
to maintain the laminate flooring in the unit in a good state of repair.  The
photos from the Tenant show that the flooring has sustained water damage from
the leaks and is stained/discoloured.  The issue is cosmetic and does not warrant
an abatement however I am ordering repair.
23.  
Regarding the Tenant’s claim
of mould in the unit, I am not satisfied that there is mould in unit.  An email
from TT, a municipal law enforcement officer dated September 10, 2018 indicates
that she did not observe any visible mould during her inspection in early
August 2018. A report from Shape Carpentry dated September 10, 2018 also states
that no mould was observed during investigation of the foundation crack in the
unit.  The Tenant did not provide any other evidence such as an air quality
testing report to support his testimony of air borne mould.  
Garage door key pad
24.  
The Tenant testified that
the key pad on the garage door fails sometimes mostly in colder weather.  He
said attempted repair by the Landlord has not been successful.  The Landlord
said the only issue he became aware of related to the garage door was a
malfunctioning spring which he repaired within four days of discovering it.
25.  
The Tenant has not provided
sufficient evidence regarding any repair required to the garage door key pad.
Washer 
26.  
The Tenant testified that
there is a smell of sewage from the washer because there is no p-trap.  He said
this appliance damages his clothing but he is able to use it.  The Landlord
denies any repair issue required to the washer.  He inspected the appliance on
July 6th, found a p-trap installed and did not detect any sewer gas
odours.  The Tenant has not provided sufficient evidence that there is any
repair required to the washer.  This claim is dismissed.
27.  
The Tenant testified that
there is a missing dryer vent which creates high humidity in the unit and which
he believes will cause mould.  The Landlord testified the dryer is indoor
vented into the unit with a lint catcher.  The Tenant has not substantiated any
repair required to the dryer vent such that the dryer must be vented outside. 
This claim is dismissed.
Mice, maggots
28.  
The Tenant testified that
there are mice and maggots in the unit.  He said he took care of the mice by
purchasing traps.  He said the Landlord told him there was a sound device in
the kitchen to discourage mice however he saw a dead rat under the kitchen sink
and he continues to hear mice.  He said he also saw maggots once for two days
in early July and August 2018.  He submitted a photo of the maggots.  The
Tenant sent the Landlord a text message on July 10th and August 9th
reporting maggots.
29.  
The Tenant has not provided
sufficient evidence regarding mice in the unit.  There were no photos submitted
of mice.  It is probable there were some type of pests on the two occasions the
Tenant described, however the impact was minimal based on the Tenant’s own
evidence and the issue has not reoccurred since August 9th, 2018. This
does not constitute a breach of section 20. This claim is dismissed.
Relief from eviction
30.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act and find
that it would not be necessary to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act because the Tenant said he could pay the amount
owing by September 30, 2018 and as of the date of this order, this date is
within the 11 days usually allowed to a tenant to repay any rent owing.
It is ordered that:
 
L1 rent arrears application: 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before October
5, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $1,600.27*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to September 24, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes
on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $29.75 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
September 25, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before October 5, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
October 6, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before October 5, 2018, then starting October 6, 2018, the Landlord may

If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after October 6, 2018 but

entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
