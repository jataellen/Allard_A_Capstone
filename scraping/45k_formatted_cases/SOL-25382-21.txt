Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-25382-21
 



In the matter
of:


1,
304 UPPER KENILWORTH AVENUE HAMILTON ON L8T4G2


 




Between:


Biruta Wilkialis Frank Wilkialis


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Shawn Filko


Tenant



 
 
Biruta Wilkialis and Frank
Wilkialis (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Shawn
Filko (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 1, 2022.
Only the Landlords attended
the hearing. As of 10:08 a.m., the Tenant was
not present or represented at the hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from August 1, 2021 to
February 28, 2022. Because of the
arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective October 16,
2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent for the unit increased
to $644.00.
 
4.    
The Landlords
collected a rent deposit of $550.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlords.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period from May 1, 2012 to
October 16, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $1,000.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 19, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords
$3,688.33*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to
February 8, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the rent
deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords
$21.17 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 9, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing* on or before February 19, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 20,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 19, 2022, then starting
February 20, 2022, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 20, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 19, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $3,018.00** to the Landlords or
to the Board in trust, this order for
eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain
in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time,
the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after February 20, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
