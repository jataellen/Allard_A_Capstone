Order under Section
21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-01185-17-RV
 
 
 
Review Order
 
G.V.
(the 'Landlord') applied, to the Landlord and Tenant Board (the “Board”), for
an order to terminate the tenancy and evict S.S. (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed NSF
cheque charges and related administration charges.
 
This
application was resolved by order HOL-01185-17 issued on April 3, 2017.
 
On
May 3, 2017, the Tenant requested a review of the order and that the order be
stayed until the request to review the order is resolved.
 
On
May 5, 2017 interim order HOL-01185-17-IN was issued, staying the order issued
on April 3, 2017.
 
The
request was set to be heard in Toronto on May 25, 2017. Only the Landlord’s
legal representative, A.J. licensed paralegal, attended the hearing. 
 
On
May 24, 2017, at 2:34 p.m., the Board received a telephone call from the
Tenant, who stated that she would be unable to attend the hearing as she was
admitted to hospital. Board staff advised the Tenant that a friend or family
member should attend the hearing on the Tenant’s behalf. No one attended on
behalf of the Tenant. However, on the day of the hearing, the Tenant emailed a
document to the Board purporting to be “proof of admission” to a local
hospital.
 
For
the reasons stated during the hearing, I decided to adjourn the hearing as an
accommodation to the Tenant. As an accommodation to the Landlord who, as his
representative stated, would be significantly prejudiced due to any additional
delay in these proceedings, I had the matter return as a special hearing to be
heard by me within two weeks. 
 
When
the matter returned on June 14, 2017, the Tenant attended and was
self-represented. The Landlord’s legal representative, A.J, licensed paralegal,
also attended the hearing. 
 
During
the June 14th sitting, I heard evidence going to whether the Tenant
was reasonably able to participate in the hearing on March 27, 2017 and, for
the reasons set out below, I found that the Tenant was not reasonably able to
participate and the Landlord’s application was heard de novo. 
 
A
significant amount of evidence was heard during the June 14th
sitting of this matter and the remaining issue was a $600.00 payment
purportedly made by the Tenant, to the Landlord, which payment was not
reflected in the Notice of Termination for Non-payment of Rent
(the “N4 notice”) served to the Tenant on December 28, 2016. During the June 14th
sitting, and on the Tenant’s request, I held the matter down to allow her to
approach her bank to obtain the required documentation corroborating the
payment at issue. When the Tenant returned, she stated that her bank was unable
to provide the requested document(s) as the bank’s records only go back six
months. The Tenant added that, while she could obtain the required documentation
from the branch manager, the manager was unavailable and no one else could
assist her.
 
The
Tenant then stated that, if the matter was briefly adjourned, she would be able
to obtain the necessary documents. While the Landlord’s legal representative
opposed another adjournment, as a further accommodation to the Tenant, I agreed
to a brief adjournment with conditions. I agreed to adjourn
the hearing to return on June 20, 2017, again as a special hearing. With the
Tenant’s consent, I issued an interim order requiring the Tenant, on or before
June 19, 2017, to pay $1,800.00 to the Landlord, towards arrears of rent. The
Landlord’s legal representative agreed to accept the said payment during the
hearing on June 20, 2017, in the form of a money order. The Tenant failed to
make the said payment to the Landlord as ordered.
 
On
June 20, 2017, the Tenant sent an email to the Board stating that she was
unable to attend the hearing as she was “back in the hospital and [her] health
is deeply troubled.” The Tenant added that she would try to have a friend or
family member attend, however, if she was unable to do so, that the Board’s
decision should be emailed to her as she does not yet have access to her
mailbox. The Tenant did not attend the hearing and no one appeared on her
behalf. As the Tenant did not request an adjournment and, further, given the
history of these proceedings, I proceeded to hear brief submissions from the
Landlord’s legal representative and, as rent had come due in the interim for
another rent period, I received an updated L1/L9 Application Information Update
form from the Landlord.
  
Determinations:
 
The
Tenant’s Review Request
Was
the Tenant Reasonably Able to Participate?
1.      The unit
is an apartment in a condominium complex. The crux of the Tenant’s position is
that, despite many requests to the Landlord, the Landlord has not provided her
with a key to the unit’s mail box. The Tenant stated that the Landlord
“changed” her mail box and did not provide her with a key and, in the absence
of the Landlord’s consent, the Tenant was unable to obtain a key from the
building’s property management staff. The Tenant provided and email sent to the
Landlord in mid-February 2017 requesting a key to the mail box.
2.      The Tenant
testified that, as she did not have access to her mail box, she did not receive
the notice of hearing for March 27, 2017 and, consequently, was unaware of the
hearing. In her request for review, and again during the review hearing, the
Tenant stated that, had she known about the hearing, she would have attended. 
3.      The
Landlord’s legal representative provided a letter signed by the complex’s
assistant property manager stating that the Tenant did not request a key to the
mail box from the property management office. 
4.      As I
stated during the hearing, I prefer the Tenant’s direct testimony over the
hearsay evidence provided by the Landlord, which evidence could not tested by
cross-examination.
5.      As such,
and based on the submissions made in the Tenant’s review request and the
evidence provided during the hearing, I was satisfied that a serious error
occurred in the proceedings as the Tenant was not reasonably able to
participate in the hearing held on March 27, 2017.
The
Landlord’s Application
6.      The Tenant
has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
December 17, 2016 to July 16, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective January 16, 2017.
7.      The
Landlord is entitled to $54.00 to reimburse the Landlord for charges the
Landlord incurred as a result of cheques tendered by or on behalf of the Tenant
which were returned NSF and related administration charges.
8.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,200.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
9.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from October 18, 2016
to January 16, 2017.
10.   As stated
above, the Tenant alleges that on or about October 17, 2017, she paid $600.00
to the Landlord by e-transfer. The Tenant provided a document, which she said
shows the purported payment to the Landlord. As was pointed out to the Tenant
during the hearing, the document provided does not, like the two other
documents provided by the Tenant, indicate that the October 17, 2017 e-transfer
was accepted by the Landlord and the monies left her bank account. As explained
in the preamble above, the Tenant was extended two opportunities, on June 14,
2017 and again on June 20, 2017, to provide confirmation that the said payment
was indeed made to the Landlord and/or that the monies came out of her bank
account. The Tenant did not provide any such documentation and I find, on a
balance of probabilities, that the payment was not made as alleged. I further
find that, as at the date of the hearing on June 20, 2017, the total amount
owing to the Landlord, for arrears of rent, is $11,600.00.
11.   The
Landlord’s legal representative requested a standard order, according the
Tenant eleven days to void the order and continue the tenancy.
12.   On June
14, 2017, I asked the Tenant some questions geared towards eliciting evidence
going to whether I should delay or deny the Landlord’s request. While the Tenant
provided some evidence in this regard, the matter was adjourned to allow the
Tenant to obtain evidence going to prove the $600.00 payment to the Landlord as
outlined above. As the Tenant did not attend the hearing on June 20, 2017, no
additional evidence was provided on section 83 relief.
13.   The Tenant
is a single woman and the sole occupant of the unit. She took possession of the
unit in mid-October, 2016. The monthly rent for the unit is $1,800.00 and is
due on the 17th day of the month. The last rent payment made by the
Tenant, on January 12, 2016 and in the sum of $1,000.00, covered the rent to
December 16, 2016. The Tenant has made no additional payments to the Landlord.
14.   The Tenant
testified that she was in the hospital for the entire month of March, 2017, and
unable to work. Afterwards, the Tenant worked but stated that she was not paid
by her employer and she will be going to the “labour board” in this regard.
15.   I asked
the Tenant is she is able to approach family and/or friends for assistance to
repay her arrears debt to the Landlord and the Tenant stated that she is not
able to do so.
16.   The
arrears amount is substantial. The Landlord’s legal representative stated that
the Landlord, who is in poor health and is hospitalized, depends on the rent
payments to make the mortgage payments and pay other expenses related to the
unit, such as property taxes. The significant arrears and the delay in the
proceedings has, as submitted the Landlord’s legal representative, caused great
hardship to the Landlord.
17.   While the
Tenant may have been hospitalized during the month of March, 2017, I note that
prior to that, and since being released from the hospital, the Tenant has not
made any good faith payments to the Landlord—even token payments to show that
she is serious about maintaining her tenancy. As well, the Tenant did not
provide any evidence going to her wages dispute with her employer and going to
her being hospitalized during the month of March, 2017. As this matter was,
initially, a review hearing requested by the Tenant, I would expect this
evidence to have been produced.
18.   Having
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), I find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
the Act.
It is
ordered that:
1.      The
request to review order HOL-01185-17 issued on April 3, 2017 is granted. The
order is cancelled and is replaced by this order.
2.      Unless the
Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and
the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before July 3, 2017.
3.      The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord $10,740.72*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to June 22, 2017 and the total charges related to NSF
cheque tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
4.      The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $59.18 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting June 23, 2017 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
5.      The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
6.      If the
Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before July 3,
2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from July 4, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
7.      If the
unit is not vacated on or before July 3, 2017, then starting July 4, 2017, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
8.      While the
Landlord may file this order with the Sheriff immediately upon receipt thereof,
upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 4,
2017.
9.      If, on or
before July 3, 2017, the Tenant pays the amount of $11,829.00** to the Landlord
or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the
unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
10.   The Tenant
may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside
this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after
July 4, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
