Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict R. D and B. D (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Whitby on January 6, 2020.
 
The Landlord and the second-named Tenant
attended the hearing. The Landlord was represented by Bryan Rubin. 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid the
total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from February 1,
2019 to January 31, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice
of Termination effective October 4, 2019.
2.     
The parties agree the arrears
and costs owing to January 31, 2020 total $4,817.72.
3.     
The Tenants paid $850.00
after the application was filed.
4.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $876.85 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2017 to October 4, 2019.
TENANT’S REQUEST FOR RELIEF
6.     
The Tenant’s evidence was that
he fell into arrears is because he has been having trouble keeping a job since July
2019. 
7.     
He seeks a chance to preserve
his tenancy and requests relief in the form of a repayment plan. He proposes to
pay $1,200.00 on January 20, 2020 and then an additional $288.04 on top of the monthly
rent for the next seventeen months. In the event a payment plan is not granted,
the Tenant seeks a delay in eviction of 30 days so that he is able to gather first
and last month’s rent and make alternative living arrangements. 
8.     
He states that his household
income is approximately $2,300.00 which includes the Child Tax Benefit, his income
(which is weather-dependant) and his girlfriend’s income. The total household expenses
are $1,671.96 which is inclusive of the rent, phone bill, groceries and pet expenses.

9.     
He lives in the rental unit with
his girlfriend and children ages 5 and 2 years old. 
10.  
Upon cross examination, it appeared
that the Tenant was previously at the Board for an arrears application based on
arrears that had accumulated in November 2018. The Tenants managed to clear in January
2019 but then fell into arrears the following month resulting in this N4 notice
of termination before the Board. The Tenant has no recollection of this but agrees
he had paid up to date by the end of January 2019 and agrees he hasn’t paid his
rent on time since then. 
11.  
The Landlord opposes the Tenants’
request for a repayment plan as no payments have been received by the Landlord towards
the arrears or the rent since November 2019, even though the Tenant has been employed
for the past two months. 
ANALYSIS
12.  
The N4 notice of termination
shows arrears accumulating from February 2019 through to September 2019. Thus, the
Tenant’s assertion that his financial troubles
only began in July 2019 fails explain the arrears that arose during the period between
February 2019 and June 2019. I asked the Tenant if he could provide clarification,
but he was unable to explain. Absent any other evidence it appears that the Tenant
is unwilling or unable to pay the rent to the Landlord. 
13.  
If the Tenants’ expenses are
subtracted from their income, $ 628.04 remains each month.  I asked the Tenant if
he was able to increase his arrears payments to shorten the length of his payment
plan. The Tenant ’s response was that he could pay an additional $300.00 for each
arrears payment. 
14.  
The concern that I have with
the Tenant’s repayment plan is that his work is seasonal and that the stable income
that is coming into the household (Child Tax Benefit and the girlfriend’s employment
income) is insufficient to meet both the Tenants’ ongoing monthly expenses and the
payments towards the arrears. 
15.  
Therefore, I find that awarding
a repayment plan under the circumstances would be unfair. I can however
consider whether to postpone the eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of
the Act. 
16.  
While the Landlord seeks a standard,
voidable eleven-day order, I find that some delay is warranted given the Tenant’s
family size, including young children and the fact that the Tenant has lived at
the rental unit for almost five years. Given these circumstances, I find that the
Tenants’ request for a delay in eviction by 30 days is reasonable and an order shall
issue accordingly. 
17.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until February 20, 2020 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b)
of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before February
20, 2020.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $3,434.92*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to January 20, 2020, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $29.98 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting January 21, 2020 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 20, 2020, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
February 21, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 20, 2020, then starting February 21, 2020, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 21, 2020.
8.     
If the Tenants wish to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $4,817.72 if the payment is made on or before January 31, 2020, or
ii)       $5,729.68 if the payment is made on or before February 20, 2020**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after February 21,
2020 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants
are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
