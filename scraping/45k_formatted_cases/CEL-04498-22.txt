File Number: CEL-04498-22
 
 



In the matter

1245981 Ontario Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Steve (Steven) Ennis


Tenant



 
 
 
1245981 Ontario Ltd. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Steve
(steven) Ennis (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent
the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on August 9, 2021 with respect to
application CEL-00262-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition(s) specified in the order: The Tenant failed to pay the lawful
rent for January
2022 by the date
prescribed on the Order.
 
3.     Since the date of the order, the Landlord incurred
charges of $5.00
for cheques tendered by or on behalf of the Tenant
which were returned NSF and $20.00 for related administration charges.
 
4.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,178.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from February 1, 2021 to February 14, 2022.
 
6.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.

It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order CEL-00262-21 is cancelled.

the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 25, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $25.36*. This amount represents the rent owing
up to January 31, 2022 and the total charges related to NSF cheque
tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant, less the rent deposit
and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $38.74
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 15,
2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing* on or before February 25, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 26,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 25, 2022, then starting
February 26, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
