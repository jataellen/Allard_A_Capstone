Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number:
CEL-03552-21
 



In the matter
of:


2402, 3 KNIGHTSBRIDGE ROAD BRAMPTON ON L6T3X3


 




Between:


Capreit Limited Partnership


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Sayed Shah
  Syed Shah


Tenants



 
 
Capreit Limited Partnership (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sayed
Shah and Syed Shah (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 17, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Jason Paine, attended the hearing. As of
10:17 a.m., the Tenants were not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from May 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served a Notice
of Termination effective October 21, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are
in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent for
the unit is $1,345.76.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,329.81 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from July 1, 2020 to October 21, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenants paid $5,675.57 after
the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including
the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether
the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.

It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 8, 2022.
 
2.    
As of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the Landlord is entitled to by $1,018.25*.
 
3.     However, the Landlord
is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenants: $43.72 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 26, 2022 to the date the Tenants
move out of the unit,
and $186.00 for the cost of
filing the application.
 
4.    
The Landlord
or the Tenants shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 8, 2022, then starting March 9, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 9, 2022.
 
7.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$709.67 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022, or
ii)             
$2,055.43 if the payment
is made on or
before March 8, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not
make full payment in
accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.    
The Tenants may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of
the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March 9, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once
during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
