Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57543-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


304, 767 SECOND STREET LONDON ON N5V3C4


 




Between:


Capreit Limited Partnership


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Tammy Brannigan


Tenant



 
 
 
Capreit Limited Partnership (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tammy
Brannigan (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the
Tenant owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued
by the Board on October 21,
2021 with respect to application SWL-52587-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenant failed to pay $69.33 towards
the arrears, on or before
January 1, 2022. The Tenant fail to
pay the lawful monthly rent in full, on or before January 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $693.26 for rent arrears
and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order SWL-52587-21.
The amount that is still owing from that order is $592.47 and that amount is
included in this order. As a result,
the previous order
SWL-52587-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from November 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.
6.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $331.48 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.




 
 
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 1, 2020
to January 21, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SWL-52587-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 1, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$1,887.52*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to January 21, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $31.25
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 22, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
1, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 2, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 1, 2022, then starting
February 2, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 2, 2022.
