In the matter
  of:


 
161 ONTARIO ROAD MITCHELL ON N0K1N0


 




Between:


Randa Reis


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Ashley Wettlaufer


Tenant



 
 
 
Randa Reis (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ashley Wettlaufer (the
'Tenant') because the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for the
purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on January 21, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord R. Reis and the Landlord’s legal representative H. Bettles attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
On June 12, 2021,
the Landlord served the
Tenant with an N12 Notice to Terminate the Tenancy for Owner’s Own Use pursuant
to subsection 48 (1) of the ACT.
 
2.       
Section 48.1 of the Act provides
that the Landlord
must pay compensation equal to one month’s rent to the Tenant.
48.1 A landlord
shall compensate a tenant in an amount equal to one month’s rent or offer the tenant another
rental unit acceptable to the tenant
if the landlord gives the tenant a notice of termination of the
tenancy under section 48. 2017, c. 13, s. 8.
 
3.       
Section 55.1 of the Act requires
that this compensation be paid no later than the
termination date in the notice served.
55.1 If the landlord is required to compensate a tenant under section 48.1, 49.1, 52, 54 or 55, the landlord shall compensate the
tenant no later than on the termination date specified in the notice of
termination of the tenancy given by the landlord under section 48, 49 or 50.
2017, c. 13, s. 9; 2020, c. 16, Sched. 4, s. 8.
 
4.       
The termination date on the N12 Notice was September 30, 2021




File Number: SWL-55086-21
 
 
 
5.       
The Landlord paid the Tenant compensation equal to one month's rent in the amount of
$1328.00 on October 1, 2021 in the form of
a cheque. The date the Tenant was provided
a cheque is beyond the date of termination noted on the N12.
 
6.       
Because the Landlord failed
to comply with section 55.1 of the Act, the Board
has no authority to terminate
the tenancy under these circumstances.
 
7.       
The Tenant shall return
the cheque in the amount of $1328.00 to the Landlord
or pay the Landlord $1328.00 if the cheque has been cashed.
 
8.       
This order contains all the reasons
in this matter and no further reasons
will be issued.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
 
 
February 17, 2022
