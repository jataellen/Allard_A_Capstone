Order under Section 69

File Number: TNL-35200-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1914, 470 SENTINEL ROAD NORTH YORK ON M3J1V6


 




Between:


Ranee Management


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Ann-Marie
Barnett-Cameron Omar J Cameron


Tenants



 
 
 
Ranee Management (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Omar J Cameron and Ann-Marie Barnett-Cameron (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 31, 2022. The
Landlord's Legal Representative, Ilana Glickman attended the hearing. As of 10:16 a.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from May 1, 2021 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 25, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,373.32.
 
4.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,373.32
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the
Tenants for the period from January 1, 2021 to August 25, 2021.




File Number: TNL-35200-21
 
6.    
The Tenants paid $7,300.00
after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until April 30, 2022
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
April 30, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $257.15*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
11, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $45.15
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 12,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before April
30, 2022, the Tenants will
start to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from May 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before April 30, 2022, then starting May 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 1, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenants
wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$2,626.35 if the payment
is made on or before February 28, 2022, or
ii)             
$3,999.67 if the payment
is made on or before
March 31, 2022, or
iii)            
$5,372.99 if the payment
is made on or before
April 30, 2022**.
If the Tenants
do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.

9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after May 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this
motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
