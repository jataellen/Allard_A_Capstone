Justin Eikelenboom (Davis)


Tenant



 
 
Review Order
 
Linda Harvey (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Justin Eikelenboom (Davis)
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved by order CEL-95842-20 issued on January
25, 2021. On February 8,
2021, the Tenant requested a review of the order.
The request
was heard in Board
video conference room 83 on April 12, 2021.
Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
The sole basis for the Landlord’s request for review
is not reasonably able to participate
in the hearing held on January 21, 2021 at 3 p.m.
 
2.     The Landlord states that she had technical
difficulties attending the hearing. She
attempted to get help from a friend.
When the Landlord
tried to log onto the meeting on Microsoft Teams her screen was just
black. The Board staff also reached
out to get a hold of the member at the hearing but was unable.
 
3.    
The testimony before the Board is uncontested and I have no reason
to doubt the Landlord’s statements.
 
4.     As a result,
the Landlord’s request
for review is granted and the application is heard in its entirety.




 
5.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from March 1, 2020 to April 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective September 4, 2020.
 
6.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order CEL-95842-20 issued
on January 25, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the
following:
 
2.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 19, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$13,852.80*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to April 12, 2021.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $42.74
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting April 13, 2021 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 19, 2022, then starting
February 20, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 20, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 19, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $28,036.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust less any
payments made after the review hearing date, this order for eviction will
be void. This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 20, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period
of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
