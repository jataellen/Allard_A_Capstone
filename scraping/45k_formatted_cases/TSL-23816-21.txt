Order under Section

Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-23816-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


301, 17 HOMEWOOD AVENUE TORONTO ON M4Y2J7


 




Between:


2831415


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kevin
Provost


Tenant



 
 
 
2831415 (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Kevin Provost
(the 'Tenant')
 
This application was heard via videoconference on December 7, 2021.
 
Only the Landlords Agent Jeannie Zhang attended the hearing. As of 1:52 p.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing
although properly notified
of this hearing
by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord
served a first N5 on August 6, 2021. The voiding period was August
6-13, 2021. The Landlord
alleged that the Tenant was admitting
‘strangers” in the house;
and that they left after a short period of time.
 
2.    
The Landlord served a
second non-voidable N5 on August 21, 2021. The Landlord alleged that the Tenant
was admitting “strangers” into the house; and that they left after a short period of time.
 
3.    
I find the two N5
notices do not set out the necessary reasons and details required by subsection
43(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). The notices fail to indicate why the Tenant could not have guests,
even persons unknown
to the Landlord, or why the time they arrived or departed constitutes
substantial interference.
 
4.     Subsection 43(2) of the Act, has been
interpreted by the Divisional Court in Ball v. Metro Capital Property [2002]
O.J. No. 5931 where the courts held that sufficient detail includes the dates and times of the alleged conduct
along with a detailed description of the alleged conduct; and that the notice is
void if it fails to provide sufficient detail.
This is a strict interpretation.




File Number: TSL-23816-21
 
5.    
As a result, I was not satisfied that the Notices
met the requirements of the Act for
precision and clarity.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
