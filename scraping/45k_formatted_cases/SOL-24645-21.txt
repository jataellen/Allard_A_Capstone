Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24645-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


LOWER, 95 CHETWOOD STREET ST. CATHARINES ON L2S2A6


 




Between:


Layan Lee Tung


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Daniel Ceci Kristen Haskins


Tenants



 
 
 
Layan Lee Tung
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Kristen Haskins and Daniel Ceci (the 'Tenants') because they have been
persistently late in paying their rent. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 956 0593 7653#
on January 5, 2022.
 
The Landlord
and the Tenant,
Kristen Haskins attended
the hearing. Charlene
Clucas, the attended as
witness for the Landlord.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The details
on the N8 Notice lists 11 Board eviction orders
numbers issued between
2014 and 2018 and does not include information about the Tenants’
payment history after 2018
but the Tenant stated she was not confused and new the case required to be met.
 
2.    
The
Tenants rent charge is due on the first of
each month as per the tenancy
agreement but shortly after the tenancy started they made an agreement
that the Tenants’ rent can be paid on the 20th day of the month to coincide with the Tenants’
receipt of government child benefit income.
 
3.    
I find there’re
insufficient details on the N8 Notice about the Tenant’s payment history.
Although details were supplemented by oral testimony, I find the Landlord has
not met the burden of proof to satisfy me that the Tenants have persistently
paid rent when there’s no dispute
the Landlord has agreed to permit the Tenants to pay their rent on the
20th day of each month for over eight years.
 
It is ordered
that:
