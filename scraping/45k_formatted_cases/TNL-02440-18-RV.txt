Order under Section 21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-02440-18-RV



 


 


 



 
Review Order
 
MY
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict II
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was resolved by order TNL-02440-18 issued on March 22, 2018.
 
On
March 26, 2018, the Landlord requested a review of the order.
 
The
Landlord applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant
because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused undue
damage to the premises and because the Tenant has seriously
impaired the safety of any person. The Landlord also applied for an
order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage and for compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the
unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard with the request to review on April 25,
2018.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s representative, SN, and the Tenant
attended the hearing. The Tenant was assisted by a Russian language
interpreter.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Landlord’s application to evict the Tenant for non-payment was dismissed
because of an error in the computation of time.
 
2.      I
heard the application de novo.
 
 
3.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from December 1, 2017 to April 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective February 11, 2018.
 
4.      The
Tenant has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage
to the rental unit by throwing knives at the door (using it as a dart board).
 
5.      The
cost of repairing the damage to the door or other damage to the rental unit
cannot be ascertained because the Tenant has threatened to kill the Landlord or
use him as a dart board for his knives if the Landlord enters the rental unit. 
 
6.      By
threatening to kill the Landlord or to assault him with the intention of
causing bodily harm, the Tenant has seriously impaired the safety of other
persons and this act or omission occurred in the residential complex.
 
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act. At the hearing, the Tenant continued to threaten
and intimidate the Landlord and the Landlord’s representative.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Order
TNL-02440-18 issued on March 22, 2018 is cancelled and replaced by the
following: the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The
Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before May 7, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $3,993.32*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to May 2, 2018.
 
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $26.30 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting May 3, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before May 7,
2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from May 8, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before May 7, 2018, then starting May 8, 2018,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
 
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after May 8, 2018. The
Sheriff is requested to expedite the enforcement of this order.
