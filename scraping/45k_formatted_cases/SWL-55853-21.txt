408, 221 QUEEN STREET
S KITCHENER ON N2G1W5


 




Between:


Steeves and Rozema Enterprises Limited


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Cody Rightmeyer-Shane


Tenant



 
 
 
Steeves and Rozema Enterprises
Limited (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Cody Rightmeyer-Shane (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 27, 2022. The Landlord's Legal Representative, Julian Shumka, and advocate for the Tenant,
Hollee George, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from July 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective October 14, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,254.88 as of January 1, 2022.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,240.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from July 31, 2020 to
December 31, 2020.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $1,778.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.     The advocate for the Tenant indicated that they wanted
an order for the Tenant to be able
to pay $400 per month in addition to the rent in order to pay back the arrears
to the Landlord and preserve the Tenancy. The
advocate for the Tenant also indicated that the Tenant had been removed from
the rental unit by police a few months ago and has not




 
been able to return to the unit and that there is someone
authorized by the Tenant
staying in the rental unit.
 
8.     The Landlord was opposed to the request for an
extended payment plan based on the Tenant not being able to be in possession of the rental
unit and the Landlord not wanting
to enter into payment terms to preserve the occupancy of the Tenants occupant
of the rental unit.
 
9.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find
that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 28, 2022
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4,217.94*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
10, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $41.26 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 11, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 28, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 28, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $6,497.76** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after March




 
1, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
