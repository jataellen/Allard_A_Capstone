Francine Renaud-Wilson
  Jo-Ann Rivard


Tenants



 
 
Galaxy Value Add Ontario
Properties LP (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Francine Renaud-Wilson and Jo-Ann Rivard
(the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 18, 2022. The
Landlord's Legal Representative, Victoria Orlandi,
and the Tenant,
Jo-Ann Rivard, attended
the hearing on behalf
of both Tenants.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from June 1, 2021 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 28, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,534.32 as of January
1, 2022.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,451.14 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from December 1, 2014 to February 2, 2022.
 
6.     The Tenants paid $7,545.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the




File Number: EAL-97925-21
 
Tenant, and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until March 31, 2022
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b)
of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 31, 2022.
 
2.    
As of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the
Landlord is entitled to by $1,357.83*.
 
3.    
However, the Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount the
Landlord owes the Tenants: $50.44 per
day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 3, 2022 to the
date the Tenants move out of the unit, and $186.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
4.     The Landlord or the Tenants
shall pay to the other
any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before March 31, 2022, then starting April 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 1, 2022.
 
7.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)   $1,872.55 if the payment is made on or before
February 28, 2022, or
ii)    $3,406.87 if the payment is made on or before March 31, 2022**.
If the
Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after April 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this
motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
