Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006











 
 

EA, MB and LA (the 'Landlords') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict CB (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.  (L1 Application)
 
The Landlords also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Landlords require possession of
the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlords also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the
termination date.  (L2 application)
 
These applications were heard in Mississauga on
September 25, 2018.  One of the Landlords, EA, and
the Tenant attended the hearing.  The Tenant was able to consult with Tenant
Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 Application
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from August 1, 2018 to
September 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of
Termination effective August 21, 2018.
2.     
The Landlords collected a
rent deposit of $356.30 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by
the Landlords.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 16, 2018 to August 21, 2018.
4.     
CB disputed the amount of
rent deposit stating that he had initially paid a last month’s rent deposit to
the previous owner in the amount of $900.00.  CB testified that the original
rent was $900.00 in July 2017 and that he paid $900.00 toward the last month’s
rent deposit.  Due to a reduction in services (removal of internet service), CB
testified the rent was reduced to the current $850.00 in November 2017.  
5.     
It was established at the
hearing that the Landlords purchased the rental unit from the previous landlord
effectively on April 16, 2018.
6.     
EA submitted exhibit LL#1 to
evidence the last month’s rent deposit was $350.00 on April 16, 2018 when the
Landlords took ownership of the rental unit.
7.     
CB testified that he is able
to prove he had paid a full deposit to the previous landlord, MR, if he were
given a little time to do so.  CB asked that he be allowed to provide a
post-hearing submission.  Against the objection of EA, I granted CB a chance to
submit evidence of any last month’s rent deposit he claims to have made.  I
gave CB until midnight, September 26th, 2018 to submit to the Board
his evidence.  I explained that if he does not submit satisfactory evidence by
this deadline to support his claim of a higher last month’s rent deposit, then
I will accept the Landlords’ submission of $356.00 as supported by LL#1.
8.     
I note that the Tenant made
no post-hearing submission by the set deadline, and as of the writing of this
order, he has made no submission.  I, therefore, find the last month’s rent deposit
is $356.30 as specified in paragraph 2 above.
9.     
After the application was
filed, the Tenant made no payments but has been credited with $850.00 for
September 2018 rent because of the requirement for compensation by the Landlord
under the L2 application.
L2 Application
10.  
EA stated that she and her
family live upstairs above the rental unit.  EA testified that her brother, PB,
who is also MB’s son, is a 38 year-old single male who recently underwent knee
surgery and is recovering.  EA affirmed that PB is in temporary residence with
his parents and intends to move into the rental unit for at least a period of
one year.  It was also brought forward by the parties that the Landlords intend
to renovate the rental unit when PB is able to move into the rental unit.  The
Landlords already submitted PB’s affidavit with the application.  Copies of the
affidavit and the N12 certificate of service, were given to CB during the
hearing at his request.
11.  
CB denied ever receiving the
N12 notice of termination until he received the notice of hearing in the mail
from the Board.  
12.  
EA’s position was that CB
was served with an N12 notice on July 31st.  She affirmed that she
herself placed the N12 notice under a door to the rental unit on July 31,
2018.   
13.  
The Landlords produced a
certificate of service, dated August 13, 2018, stating that the said N12 was
served to the Tenant on July 31, 2018, by placing the document under the door
or through the mail slot in the door—one of the permissible methods of service
under the legislation.
14.  
The Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) and the Board’s Rules require a landlord to provide
the tenant with documents, including N12 notices, and, if they are served in
accordance with the Act and Rules, they are deemed to have been served whether a
tenant receives them or not.  It is only when documents are not served in
accordance with one of the permissible methods set out in subsection 191(1) or
Rule 5 that the landlord must prove the tenant actually received them (pursuant
to subsection 191(2) of the Act). 
15.  
Here, the certificate of
service provided by the Landlords states that the N12 was served to the Tenant
in accordance with one of the permissible methods set out in subsection 191(1)
of the Act and, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, I find, on a
balance of probabilities, that the N12 notice was served to the Tenant on July
31, 2018.
16.   Based on the testimonies and evidence before me, I find that in
accordance with section 48(1) of the Act and with reference to Salter V.
Beljinac, 2001 CanLII 40231 (ON SCDC), [2001] O.J. No. 2792 (Div.Ct.), the
Landlords in good faith require possession of the rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation.
17.  
The Landlords waive the
lawful monthly rent for September 2018, which represents the amount required to
be paid to the Tenant in accordance with subsections 48.1 and 55.1 of the Act. 
This amount has been credited as a payment toward the rent arrears under the L1
application.
Section 83
18.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until October 15, 2018 for the L1 application and
November 30, 2018 for the L2 application, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of
the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
L1 Application
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before October
15, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlords $524.25*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to October 1, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on
the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $27.95 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
October 2, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before October 12, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
October 13, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before October 15, 2018, then starting October 16, 2018, the Landlords
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlords, on or after October 16, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before October 15,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $1,890.00** to the Landlords or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after October 16, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlords.
L2 Application
10.  
Even if the Tenant voids the
L1 application portion of the order above, the tenancy between the Landlords
and the Tenant is terminated in a final way (non-remedial), as of November 30,
2018.  
11.  
The Tenant must move out of
the rental unit on or before November 30, 2018.
12.  
If the unit is not vacated
on or before November 30, 2018, then starting December 1, 2018, the Landlords
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
13.  
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlords on or after December 1, 2018.
14.  
If the unit is not vacated
on or before November 30, 2018, he Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords
$27.95 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting December 1,
2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
