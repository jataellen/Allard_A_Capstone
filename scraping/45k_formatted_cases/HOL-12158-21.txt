Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12158-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


202, 2355 SHEPPARD AVENUE
W TORONTO ON M9M0E7


 




Between:


Charles Tsang


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jahlaun Lewis Navada T Brown


Tenants



 
 
 
Charles Tsang
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jahzari Adams, Treaiah Adams, Navada
T Brown, Jahlaun
Lewis and Jadmier
Adams (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by way of video conference on January 17, 2022. The Landlord’s
legal representative Sharron Harris and the Tenant Navada T Brown attended the
hearing.
 
The application is amended
to remove Jadmier
Adams, Jahzari Adams
and Treaiah Adams as
respondents to the application.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from June 1, 2021 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective September 17, 2021.
 
2.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $2,350.00
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
3.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from October
25, 2019 to September 17,
2021.
 
4.     The Tenants paid $1,500.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.     The parties agree that the total amount owing to
January 31,2022 is $16,636.00 which includes
$16,450.00 in arrears
of rent, plus the Landlord’s $186.00 application filing fee.
 
6.    
The Tenant testified that during
the summer of 2021 her partner left her and stopped contributing to the household
income. The Tenant was working
as an Uber driver, but




File Number: HOL-12158-21
 
her vehicle was stolen towards
the end of July 2021. The Tenant was
leasing the vehicles and as such, the insurance company
paid the value
of the car to the leasing
company and not the Tenant.
 
7.     The Tenant is currently not employed, and her only source of income is through Child
Tax Benefits and Child Support payments totaling $2,100.00 per month. The Tenant is looking for employment and
is hoping to be back to work within one month.
 
8.     The Tenant has 3 children
ages 7-14 and requests at least two months to find alternate housing to be able to start a
repayment plan.
 
Relief from
eviction:
 
9.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until March 15, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
10.  The arrears are substantial, and the Landlord
is a non-corporate Landlord who relies on rental income to assist with paying
the mortgage on the property. The
evidence is also clear that the Tenant’s current income is less than the
currently month rent being charged. I
am mindful however to the fact that the Tenant has 3 children and as such, will
grant some additional time to find alternate housing or to pay the arrears.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 15, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$15,507.53*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 18, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $77.26
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 19,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before March 1, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from March 2,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 15, 2022, then starting
March 16, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.




File Number: HOL-12158-21
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 16, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$18,986.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022,
or
ii)             
$21,336.00 if the payment
is made on or before March 15, 2022**.
If the Tenants
do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after March 16,
2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
