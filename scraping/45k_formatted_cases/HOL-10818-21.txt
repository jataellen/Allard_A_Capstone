Galaxy Value Add Ontario
Properties LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Chris Hensen (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed
administration charges related to NSF cheques.
 
This application was heard by
video conference on February 1, 2022.   Only
the Landlord's Legal Representative, Gayle Kukor-Lang,
attended the hearing. As of 2:10 p.m. the Tenant was not present or represented
at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period
from May 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective May 25,
2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
3.    
The lawful monthly rent as of January 1, 2022 is
$1,974.41.
4.    
The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed.
5.     
The Landlord incurred charges
of $188.36 for administration charges
related to 10 cheques tendered by or on behalf of the
Tenant, which were returned NSF.
 
6.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,951.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
7.     
Interest on the rent deposit has been paid to the Tenant up to December
31, 2020.
 
8.     
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with section 83 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19
on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 27, 2022.
 
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $16,966.30*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 16, 2022 and the total charges related to
the NSF cheques tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant, less
the rent deposit.
 
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$64.91 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 17, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 27, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 28, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 27, 2022, then starting February
28, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 28, 2022.
 
8.     
If, on or before February 27,
2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $19,931.18** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and
the Tenant could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 28, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
