Robilla Haider


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kendra Chapman
  Michael Graham


Tenants



 
 
Review Order
 
Robilla Haider (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kendra Chapman and Michael Graham (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe. (L1 application)
 
The Landlord also applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants because they, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential
complex have substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant;
and because they, another occupant
of the rental unit or a person the Tenants permitted in the
residential complex have seriously impaired the safety of any person. (L2
application)
 
The L1/L2 application was
resolved by order TEL-11964-20 issued on May 25, 2021. The Tenants requested a review of the order. The Tenants’
review request was resolved by order
TEL-11964-20-RV issued on October 20, 2021.
 
On November 11, 2021, the Tenants
requested a review
of order TEL-11964-20-RV and that the order be stayed until the request to
review the order is resolved.
 
On November 15, 2021 interim order TEL-11964-20-RV-IN was issued, staying
the order issued on May 25, 2021.
 
The request was heard by videoconference on January 28, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord’s legal
representative C. Aylwin attended the hearing. As of 10:09 a.m., the Tenants were not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.




 
Determinations:
 
1.     Since the Tenants
did not appear at the hearing to support the review request, I find that
this review request has been abandoned.
 
2.     At the hearing
the Landlord’s legal representative requested that the Tenants
be ordered to pay costs to
the Landlord. The Landlord’s legal representative testified that the Tenants
did not notify the Landlord that they would not be attending the hearing for
the review request and this caused the Landlord’s legal representative to prepare and attend unnecessarily.
 
3.     Section 204 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 permits the Board to order a party to pay the costs of another party.
Guideline 3 of the Board’s Interpretation Guidelines requires that, in
considering a request for costs awarded against a party, the Board consider
whether the party’s actions were unreasonable. A party’s actions will be
considered unreasonable if they cause undue expense or delay.
 
4.     It was unreasonable for the Tenants not to tell the
Landlord that they were not going to attend the review hearing. Due to the
Tenants’ unreasonable conduct, the Landlord’s legal representative unnecessarily
attended the review hearing. The Landlord’s legal representative attended
from 9:00am until the review hearing
was completed at 10:15am. The Landlord’s legal
representative testified that she spent one hour preparing for the hearing. I find that this amount
of preparation time was reasonable in the circumstances. I therefore find that the Landlord is entitled to costs of
$225.00 from the Tenants.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The request to review order TEL-11964-20 issued on October
20, 2021 is denied. The order is confirmed and remains
unchanged.
 
2.     The interim order issued on November 15, 2021 (issued
May 25, 2021) is cancelled. The stay of order TEL-11964-20 is lifted.
 
3.     On or before February 28, 2022, the Tenants shall pay costs to the Landlord in the
amount of $225.00.
