Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-88845-18
 










 
 
 

V.
R. P. L. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict C. C. and R. C. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent
that the Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard in Whitby on April 3, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, C. A., and the second-named Tenant
above attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      There
is no dispute between the parties that the Tenants have not paid the total rent
they were required to pay for the period from February 1, 2018 to April 30,
2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective February 20, 2018.
2.      The
Tenants paid $2,400.00 after the application was filed. As a result, the
arrears of rent owing for the period ending April 30, 2018, and as of the date
of the hearing before the Board total $829.62.
3.      The
Landlord incurred costs of $175.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
4.      The
only real issue between the parties is with respect to the Tenants’ request for
relief in the form of a repayment plan. The Tenants ask for two months to repay
the rent arrears owing. The Landlord opposes the Tenants’ request.
5.      As
I explained at the hearing, the question to be addressed pursuant to s. 83(1)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') is whether or not it
would be unfair in all of the circumstances to grant the relief the Tenants
seek. 
6.      The
Tenant who attended the hearing says the Tenants fell behind in the rent due to
expenses related to a series of deaths in the family. His mother died April 29,
2017; one of his sisters died on July 11, 2017; another died on November 18,
2017; and his aunt died on December 27, 2017. 
7.      The
Tenants have lived in the rental unit for about four years. They have income in
the form of disability and pension income that totals $2,412.00 a month. The
monthly rent is $1,081.88. The Tenants have other monthly expenses that total
$1,440.00. 
8.      As
the Landlord points out, this income and expenses profile indicates the Tenants
have an affordability problem. When this was said to the Tenant on
cross-examination he stated that he just got a new part-time job the week
before the hearing doing maintenance and cleaning work. He says that work pays
$350.00 a week.
9.      No
documentary evidence was provided corroborating any of the Tenant’s testimony. 
10.   The
only evidence presented with respect to the Landlord’s circumstances is the
history of this tenancy. 
11.   The
Board’s records show there have been four previous applications to the Board
for non-payment of rent with respect to this tenancy: 
(1)  On
December 11, 2015, the parties appeared before the Board with respect to the
application in Board file TEL-64392-15 and consented to an order that gave the
Tenants until January 3, 2016 to pay the amount outstanding. 
(2)  Then on
June 20, 2016, the parties participated in Board facilitated mediation which
resolved the application contained in Board file TEL-69599-16. The parties
agreed to a repayment plan. 
(3)  Then on
July 27, 2016, the Landlord filed an application with the Board pursuant to s.
78 of the Act alleging the Tenants breached the mediated agreement. On July 28,
2016 the Board issued order TEL-71491-16 terminating the tenancy and evicting
the Tenants. From the Board’s records it appears that the Landlord voluntarily
chose not to enforce the eviction order. I can only assume that happened
because the Tenants once again became current with the rent. 
(4)  Then on
July 31, 2017, the application contained in Board file TEL-81553-17 was
discontinued as the Tenants had paid all outstanding rent arrears and costs.
12.   So
I would agree with the Landlord that the evidence of the Tenants and the record
before the Board indicates the Tenants have an affordability problem. On the
other hand, it also supports the conclusion that the Tenants have the ability
to catch up and become current if given the opportunity to do so. If the
second-named Tenant above has the new part-time job he says he does the Tenants
can afford the rental unit and can pay the rent arrears off in a reasonable
period of time. 
13.   As
a result, and given all of the above I find that it would not be unfair to
grant the relief requested. An order shall issue accordingly. 
14.   This
order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further
reasons shall be issued.
It
is ordered that:
1.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $1,004.62 for arrears of rent up to April 30,
2018 and costs.
2.      The
tenants shall pay to the Landlord the amount set out above in accordance with
the following schedule:
(1)  $502.31
on or before June 1, 2018; and
(2)  $502.31
on or before July 1, 2018.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord the rent due for the month of May, 2018
no later than May 22, 2018.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord new rent on time and in full for the
period June 1, 2018 to July 31, 2019 or until the arrears are paid in full. 
5.      If
the Tenants fail to make any one of the payments in accordance with this order,
the outstanding balance of any arrears of rent and costs to be paid by the
Tenants to the Landlord pursuant to paragraph 1 of this order shall become
immediately due and owing and the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenants,
apply to the Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating
the tenancy and evicting the Tenants and requiring that the Tenant pay any new
arrears, NSF fees and related charges that became owing after April 30, 2018.
