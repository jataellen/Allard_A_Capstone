Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55479-21
 
 
In the matter of:      419 BASE LINE ROAD E

Between:                  Jason Macqueen                                    Landlord
 
 
and
 




Rhonda Everton Robert Bailey


Tenants




 
 
 
Jason Macqueen (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Rhonda Everton, Alan Hiemstra and Robert Bailey (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
20, 2022. The Landlord
attended the hearing. Alan
Hiemstra’s Representative, Merina Sebastian (‘MS’), and the Tenants, Rhonda
Everton and Robert Bailey, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Preliminary matters
 
1.    
As a preliminary matter, Alan
Hiemstra (‘AH’) was not in possession of the rental unit when the application was filed as required by the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, and therefore was removed as a party to
the application.
 
2.     Rhonda Everton (‘RE’) and Robert Bailey (‘RB’) were
not tenants on the lease agreement. However, remained in the rental unit after
AH vacated on or about mid-July 2021 with the Landlord’s knowledge. The
Landlord did not enter into a new tenancy agreement with RE and RB and did not bring an application to evict them within 60 days.
Therefore, RE and RB are deemed tenants pursuant to subsection 104(4) of the
Act.
 
L1 application
 
3.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from June 1, 2021 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 3, 2021.
 
4.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.




 
5.    
The lawful monthly rent is $1,380.00.
 
6.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,350.00
from the Tenants and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from June 1, 2017 to
August 3, 2021.
 
8.     The Tenants have made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
9.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The arrears
are substantial, and the Tenants have not made any payments since the
application was filed. The Tenants expect to receive an inheritance by the
middle of February 2022 which they indicate will allow them to pay the arrears
by the termination date below.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 14, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlord $9,814.19*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 3, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $45.37 per day for
compensation for the use
of the unit starting February 4, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
14, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 15, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 14, 2022, then starting February
15, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 15, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 14, 2022, the Tenants pay
the amount of $12,606.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction
will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this




 
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 15, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
