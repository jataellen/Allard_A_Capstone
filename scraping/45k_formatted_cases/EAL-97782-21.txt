someone they permitted in the residential complex have wilfully
or negligently caused
undue damage to the
premises. The Landlords has also applied for an order requiring the Tenants to
compensate the Landlords for the damage; and because they, another occupant of
the rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlords or another tenant. ; because they have
been persistently late in paying their rent
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653#
on January 12, 2022.
 
The Landlords, the Tenant,
Kelly Hiller and the Tenants’
Representative, Linda Tranter
attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s N8
Notice of Termination included a list of dates and amounts the Tenants paid rent charges
in each corresponding month from dates going back as far as
2018. It also included late fees if the Tenant failed to prepay rent by the 20th day before rent was due.

2.    
I find the details
on the Notice were very confusing since multiple rent periods were paid in advance
but were considered late by the Landlord because
he didn’t receive
payments by the 20th day before rent was due.
 
For example, the three
instalments received on January 20, 2021($300), January 21 ($700) and January
22, 2021 (192.00) were applied to February 2021 rent charges and unlawful late
charges; March 2021 rent charges was
paid in advance on February 20, 2021, April 2021 rent charges was paid in
advance by March 30, 2021, May 2021 rent charges were paid in advance by April 29, 2021. The Tenant having prepaid rent before it was due on the first of the month is
not late.
 
3.     Their agreement that the Tenants prepay rent by the 20th day of each month in
advance of the first when rent is due is contrary to the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). There’s no requirement under the Act that requires
a tenant to pay rent before rent is due. Section 3 of the Act states, “this
Act, except Part V.1, applies with respect to rental unit in residential complexes, despite any other Act and
despite any agreement or waiver to the contrary.
 
4.    
The Tenant requested the Board to order the Landlords to apply the paid late fees to their
rent but this issue is not properly before me. The Tenants may file their own
application if the Landlord collected unlawfully.
 
5.     There was no evidence led about the damage claim.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
