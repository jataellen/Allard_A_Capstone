Between:

and


 




 


Osasere
Osemwengie


Tenant



 
 
Medallion Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Osasere Osemwengie (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on July 7, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative S. Korman attended the
hearing. As of 10:30 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this
hearing by the Board.
 
The issuance
of this order was delayed.
As a result, any payments
made by the Tenant to the
Landlord after the application was heard shall be deducted from the amount
ordered by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
September 1, 2020 to July 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination.
 
2.    
At the date of the hearing the Tenant was in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is
$2,176.86.
 
4.    
At the date of the hearing
the Tenant had paid the Landlord $14,910.00, since the application
was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,131.85 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.




 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from August 1, 2020 to November 4, 2020.
 
7.    
The Landlord
seeks a termination of the tenancy on the basis of the arrears of rent owing. The Landlord testified that they
were unaware of any circumstances of the Tenant that would cause the Board to
delay or deny a termination of the tenancy. The Tenant did not attend the hearing
to provide evidence or submissions regarding their circumstances.
 
8.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
9.    
The Landlord
has incurred the cost of $201.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before January 22,
2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$11,887.62*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 11, 2022,
less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
Any additional payments the Tenant
has made to the Landlord since the
application was heard shall be applied against the amount owing.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $71.57
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 12, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
22, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 23, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
7.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 22, 2022, then starting January
23, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 23, 2022.
 
9.    
If, on or before
January 22, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $14,658.62** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the




 
tenancy would
not be terminated and the Tenant could
remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
10.  The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under
that subsection on or after January
23, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
