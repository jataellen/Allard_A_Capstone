Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19865-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1017,
  10 MACEY AVENUE SCARBOROUGH ON M1L4R4


 




Between:


Metcap Living
Management Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Berhanu Geleta


Tenant



 
 
Metcap Living Management Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Berhanu Geleta (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also
claimed NSF cheque charges and related administration charges.
 
This application was heard by
way of video conference on January 19, 2022. Only the Landlord’s legal representative Tricia
Radam attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
26, 2021.
 
2.     The Landlord incurred
charges of $7.00 for
a cheques tendered by or on behalf
of the Tenant, which was
returned NSF and $20.00 for related administration charges.
 
3.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,299.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
4.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from March 31, 2021 to September 26, 2021.
 
5.     The Tenant paid $2,900.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including the impact
of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1)
of the Act.
