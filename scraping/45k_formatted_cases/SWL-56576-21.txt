Tenants




 
 
 
PSS Spicecart Sunnydale Place
Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Anita Vandenberg, Ken Vandenberg and Kirk Vandenberg (the 'Tenants')
because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on February 17, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord’s Agent, Barry
Glina, and the Landlord's Legal Representative, Zeeshan Rehman, attended
the hearing. As of 2:17 p.m., the Tenants
were not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective November 9, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the lawful monthly
rent is $1,234.43.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,219.80 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
12, 2015 to January 2, 2022.




File Number: SWL-56576-21
 
6.    
The Tenants paid $1,939.80 after the application was filed.
 
7.     The Landlord credited
the Tenants account
by $40.00 after the application was filed. This credit is reflected as a payment in
the Schedules below.
 
8.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 7, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $2,377.00*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
24, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$40.58 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 25,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before March 7, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from March 8,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 7, 2022, then starting
March 8, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 8, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenants
wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)    
$4,134.46 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022,
or
ii)  
$5,368.89 if the payment
is made on or before
March 7, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not make full
payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline,
then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March 8, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are




File Number: SWL-56576-21
 
only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
