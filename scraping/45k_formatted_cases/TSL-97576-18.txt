Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-97576-18










 

J.S
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict D.L
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes
(L1application).
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person the
Tenant permitted in the residential complex has seriously impaired the safety
of any person (L2 application). 
 
This
L1/L2 application was heard in Toronto on August 10, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 application
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the
Tenant was required to pay for the period from May 1, 2018 to September 30,
2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective July 19, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
3.     
The monthly rent as of the date of the hearing
is $2,200.00.
4.     
The Tenant has made no payments since the
application was filed.
5.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit of
$2,200.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenant for the period from May 15, 2017 to July 19, 2018.
7.     
I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1). The Tenant’s proposed
payment plan is unrealistic considering the extent of his indebtedness to the
Landlord and others and his source of income.
L2 application
 
1.     
The Landlord served the Tenant with an N7 notice
to end his tenancy for seriously impairing the safety of any person. The N7
alleges that on July 17, 2018 the Tenant threatened the next door neighbour;
used profanities towards him and told him he would destroy the next door
neighbour’s air conditioning unit; threw garbage at the neighbour’s property,
including used disposable utensils and dead plants, instead of putting them in
the garbage bins.
2.     
The Landlord explained that the neighbour’s air
conditioning unit, which services the bottom floor of the ground floor of the
neighbour’s rental complex, was not functioning properly resulting in it being
louder than usual. The Landlord provided hearsay evidence that on July 17, 2018
the Tenant used profanities and threatened the owner of the adjacent property
with violence while the Tenant stood on his own porch. The Landlord did not
personally witness this incident and the neighbour was not called as a witness
and did not provide affidavit evidence. The Landlord did not refer to any of
the other allegations in the N7 notice.
3.     
The Tenant denied he ever threatened the owner
of the adjacent property. He said he told the owner his air conditioning unit
makes too much noise.
4.     
Although he denied telling the owner of the
adjacent building he would beat him up, he said he was speaking jokingly like
one does playing soccer. The Tenant also said he threatened to rip out the air
conditioning unit and put it on the street because it made such a racket.
5.     
As the applicant, the Landlord must prove that
the Tenant uttered statements on July 17, 2018 that seriously impaired the
safety of the neighbour. While the Landlord’s hearsay testimony about what
happened on that date is admissible, it is given less weight than the Tenant’s
oral testimony which is subject to cross-examination. The Tenant denied
uttering threats and this evidence was not disputed by the neighbour either in
person or by affidavit. As a result, the Landlord’s evidence is insufficient to
establish that the Tenant seriously impaired the safety of the neighbour. 
It is ordered that:
 
L1 application
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out
below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The
Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before August 31, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,342.05*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to August 20,
2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $72.33
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting August 21, 2018 to
the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before August 31, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe
interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from September 1, 2018 at
3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated on or before August
31, 2018, then starting September 1, 2018, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord, on or after September 1, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before August 31, 2018, the Tenant
pays the amount of $5,490.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this
order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy would not be
terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this payment is not
made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after September 1, 2018 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to
make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
L2 application
 
10.  
The L2 application is dismissed.
