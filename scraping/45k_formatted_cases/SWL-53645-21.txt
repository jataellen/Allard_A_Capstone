Tenant



 
 
 
Tomasz Janiak (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Sherry Hockey (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay
the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 16, 2021. The Landlord, the Landlord's Legal
Representative, Ronald Rybowski, the Tenant and the Tenant's Representative,
Robert Jackson, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the
Tenant was required to pay for the period from September 1, 2020 to October 31,
2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,250.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant made no payments after the application was filed.
 
5.     The residential complex was sold on October
31, 2021. As such, the only part of
the application that proceeded was the claim for rent arrears. As a result, the
order will be limited to rent arrears and costs only, not eviction.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$16,562.50, which represents the amount of rent owing up to October 31, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.

3.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the
full amount owing on or before January 17, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 18, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
