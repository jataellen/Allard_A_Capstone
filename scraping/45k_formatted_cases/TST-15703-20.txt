them.
 
The Tenants’ evidence
and submissions
 
4.    After taking ownership
of the residential complex
in April 2017 the Landlord
forced them to sign a new lease for the rental unit
with a higher rent and pay an additional $50.00/month for parking. The Tenants’
refused to sign a new lease or pay the Landlord $50.00 for parking.
 
5.    At the hearing
the Tenant OD testified that the Landlord
harassed them by sending several threatening notices between April
2017 and August 2019. (Exhibits A-F).
 
6.    The Landlord
first increased the Tenant’s rent in 2018 by serving
an N1 Notice, effective
April 1, 2018. The Landlord increased the monthly rent from $850.00 to $863.30.
The
$50.00 parking charge was not included
in this rent increase.
 
7.    On Jan 28, 2019 the
Landlord served the Tenants’ with another N1 Notice, effective May 1, 2019. The Landlord increased the rent from
$863.30 to $880.88. One month after serving
the first N1 notice
in 2019, On February 4, 2019 the Landlord served
the Tenants with another N1
Notice to increase the rent from $880.88 to $928.84. The Tenant OD testified
that this was an increase of almost $50/month for parking. The Tenants never
agreed to the $50.00 parking charge and they never paid this charge (Exhibits B
and C).
 
8.    On June 4, 2019 the Landlord served the Tenants’ with
an N5 Notice to end the tenancy because on June 4, 2019 at 12:26 p.m.,
the Tenant Mr. Skyers threatened the Landlord to sue and put him through financial hardship when the Landlord
texted the Tenant regarding paying $50/month for
parking. In the N5 Notice, the Landlord stated that due to the Tenant’s threat
he was stressed and feared for his wife and family future. The termination date
on the N5 notice was July 31, 2019 (Exhibit D).
 
9.    On June 24, 2019 the Landlord served
the Tenants’ with an N4 Notice because
the Landlord claimed that the Tenants’ owe the Landlord $1350.00 in rent
(Exhibit F).
 
10. On Sep 23, 2019 the Landlord’s application to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenants’ due to nonpayment of
rent was heard by the Board, the N4 notice was found invalid because the rental
unit was not identified on the N4 notice. In the application, the Landlord claimed
unpaid parking charges of $1350.00 only. The Landlord’s application for arrears was dismissed in order TSL-07786-19, issued on
October 18, 2019, because the Board found that the $50.00 parking charges were
an illegal rent increase and/or illegal charge. The Board determined that the
Landlord can not unilaterally change the tenancy agreement by charging the
Tenants’ for parking without their consent (Exhibit F).
 
11. The Tenant testified
that after the hearing of September 23, 2019 the Landlord sent her a text message saying that “it’s not
over”.

Landlord deliberately closed the laundry room
in the building. On April 13, 2020 the Tenants’
sent several text messages and an email to the Landlord stating that
the laundry room in the building was closed for two weeks. Between April 13,
2020 and April 15, 2020, the Landlord and the Tenants communicated via several text messages. The Landlord made the following
statements (Exhibits H, I, J and K):
 
“Go somewhere else to do laundry”.
“Get off your ass and start
walking, put yourself
at risk please not others.” “You can take this and shove it
up to your ass”
“Fuck off asshole. You don’t
like way I run things??? Move it’s a free country. The next time we meet in court don’t send your wife to do a man’s
job. Panty man does
that”
“Can’t wait You be first
on my list to be evicted”.
“Must suck to be living from pay cheque
to pay cheque”.
 
 
13. The Tenant OD testified that the Landlord
threatened to sue them and tow their car from the parking lot and kept on sending
them threatening and harassing notices, text messages and emails (Exhibits
A-F).
 
14. The Tenant testified that the Landlord’s actions have
caused unbearable emotional distress. The Tenant
OD stated that the Landlord
tried to paint her husband
as a black angry man.
 
15. The Tenant OD alleged that in 2019 the Landlord
deliberately did not maintain the grounds in the winter and summer time. On September 4, 2019 the city inspector ordered
him to cut the grass and
weeds. The Tenants’ submitted into evidence the copy of the city inspector notice.
 
16. The Tenants’ are seeking
a remedy of $10,000 for the emotional distressed caused by the Landlord.
 
The Landlord’s evidence
and submissions

put him through financial hardship. The Landlord stated that he was stressed
and feared for his wife and family future.
 
18. The Landlord testified that the Tenants’ threatened
and harassed him by sending him threatening
text messages. The Landlord testified

April 15, 2020 the Tenants’ sent him threatening and harassing text messages
and made the following statements (Exhibit L):
 
“Fuck off you stupid
pussy hole”. “You stupid.”
“You are a stupid person
based on your response”




 
“Fuck off asshole. You don’t
like way I run things??? Move it’s a free country. The next time we meet in court don’t send your wife to do a man’s
job. Panty man does that”
“Go suck your wife
pussy”
“Just a reminder I am not working now, so you get no fucking rent. Until I go back to
work. See you in court you pussy hole”.
 
19. The Landlord testified that the residential complex
has a shared coin laundry room which was shut down in April 2020 due the issue
with the dryer. The Landlord stated that due to COVID it was difficult to find
a technician to repair the dryer immediately. The Landlord testified there was another
coin laundry that at a few minutes
walk that other Tenants were using as an alternate.
 
20. The Landlord testified that as per the lease agreement
the Tenants’ have signed on January 1, 2016, the Tenants are responsible to mow and water the lawn, flower beds, and
shrubbery in good order. A copy of the lease agreement was submitted as an
evidence (Exhibit M).
 
21. The Landlord
asserted that he filed N1, N4 and N5 notices
because he has a right to go to the Board to resolve any dispute
between him and the Tenants.
 
The
Law
 
22. The relevant sections
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act) state:
 
22  A landlord shall not at any time during a tenant’s occupancy of a rental unit and before
the day on which an order evicting the tenant
is executed substantially interfere with the reasonable enjoyment of the
rental unit or the residential complex in which it is located for all usual purposes
by a tenant or members
of his or her household. 2006, c. 17, s. 22.
Landlord not to harass,
etc.
 
 
23  A landlord shall not harass,
obstruct, coerce, threaten
or interfere with a
tenant.
 
Analysis
 
23. From the testimonies and evidence of the parties, I
find the relationship between these parties deteriorated steadily into a
dysfunctional and acrimonious relationship starting in April 5, 2017 when the Landlord
sent an email to the Tenants and notified them of $50.00 monthly parking charges.
 
24. From my point of view, I believe the real critical
point in their relationship began around June 4, 2019 when the Landlord gave
the invalid “notice” of termination
to the Tenants. The Landlord wanted
to charge $50.00
for parking but the Tenants,
rightfully, refused to pay this illegal charge.
 
25. However, I am not satisfied that the service of
multiple notices constituted harassment or seriously interfered with the
Tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of the premises. The N1 notices were served for the purpose
to increase the rent. The N4 notice
was served due to




 
the nonpayment of $1350.00. While ultimately the Board
determined that the Landlord
was not entitled to unilaterally charge additional rent for parking,
this does not necessarily mean that
the Landlord’ s attempt to impose the charge constituted substantial interference or harassment. The N5 notice
was served for a legitimate purpose, namely that the Landlord believed that the
Tenant had engaged in threatening and harassing behaviour. The Landlord exercised
his right under the Act to
serve a notice of termination if he believes that the Tenants breached some obligation under
the Act, just as the Tenants have filed this application because they believe
the Landlord has breached his obligations under the Act.
 
26. Closure of the coin laundry
room certainly caused
inconvenience for all the residents in the
residential complex. I am not
convinced that the coin laundry
room was closed deliberately in order to target these
particular Tenants. The coin laundry room was a facility for all the tenants
residing in the residential complex. The dryer was fixed and the coin laundry
room was opened to all before June 15, 2020.
 
27. The Tenant’s alleged
that the Landlord
deliberately did not maintain the grounds in the
residential complex. I am not compelled by the evidence that the grounds were
not maintained deliberately in order to target these Tenants.
 
28. I find that the Tenants’
submitted no evidence
in support of their
claim that the Landlord
framed her husband as a black angry man.
 
29. Having considered the Tenants’ evidence, I am not able to find in favour of the Tenants’ claims of substantial interference and harassment. Between April
13, 2020 and April 15, 2020 both parties exchanged over 140
text messages. I am convinced that the parties must share responsibility for
exchanging text messages that led to all the parties using inappropriate and
disrespectful language towards each other.
 
30. I am denying all claims relating to harassment because
the Landlord’s conduct and statements at issue
must be viewed
in their context,
which is an almost tit-for-tat exchange between the parties.
Certainly, as the issues were presented to me, I am unable to place
blame squarely on any single party and therefore as far as this T2 application
is concerned, nothing here rises to the level harassment and substantial
interference of the Tenants by the Landlord.
 
31. I do however strongly suggest that the Landlord adopt
a more professional and proper mechanism of communication to ensure the Tenants’ concerns
are received, documented and responded in a professional
manner.
 
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The T2 application is dismissed.
