and
 
Kristine Wood                                                                                                                 Tenant
 
 
 
On December
7, 2021, Jenna Leclair and Rino Levesque
(the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kristine
Wood (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant entered
into an agreement to
terminate the tenancy
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Landlords and the Tenant signed an agreement
to terminate the tenancy as of March 31, 2022.
 
2.       
Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date,
it is not appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application
filing fee as costs.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before March 31, 2022.
 
2.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 31, 2022, then starting April 1, 2022,
the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.




File Number: SWL-57403-21
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after April 1, 2022.
 
 
 
4.       
The tenant has until January
21, 2022 to file a motion with the
Board to set aside the order under s. 77(6)
of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January
21, 2022 the order will be
stayed, and the Board will schedule a hearing.
 
 
5.       
In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on October 1, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
