G.&.H.M.L.(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict M.G. and J.C. (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on May 2, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, B.
R. and the Tenant M.G. on behalf of both Tenants, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent they were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2017 to
May 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective March 20, 2018.
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $835.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from May 15, 2012 to March 20, 2018.
4.     
The Tenant was asked to
explain her personal circumstances that led to her falling into significant
arrears. She testified that she has not been receiving her child tax benefit as
she did not provide her full address to the social services worker.
5.     
The Tenant testified that
this is the first time that she has fallen into arrears and she attributes this
to having had a baby. Her 10 month old child lives with her along with the
child’s father and neither of the parents work.
6.     
The Tenant stated that she
believed that social services would advance her $3,000.00 in the future which
will help with arrears. Unfortunately the Tenant was very vague on the details
of this and did not provide any supporting evidence at the hearing.
7.     
The Tenant confirmed that
she receives $1260.00 monthly and that after the rent is deducted she is left
with $321.81 for all the other expenses for her baby and herself. In effect,
the Tenant cannot afford the rent on her income. She is relying on the baby’s
father obtaining ODSP in the future to help her out.
8.     
The Tenant proposed a 7
month repayment plan. One that the Landlord flatly refused. While I do appreciate
that the Tenant wants to try and make this work, the repayment plan is not
based on actual income that is reliable. It rests on what the Tenant hopes to
receive down the road. I did not have confidence that the repayment plan was
viable in all of her circumstances.
9.     
The Tenant testified that
the baby has grandparents in Toronto, and that she also has a sister and two
nieces in Canada for support.
10.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act; however, having
considered that there is a young child involved, I have extended the period to
void, so that the Tenant has extra time to accumulate her funds to void, if she
wants to.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before June 30,
2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $3,395.97*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to May 18, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $30.87 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting May 19, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May 29, 2018, the Tenants will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from May 30,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 30, 2018, then starting July 1, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 1, 2018.
8.     
If the Tenants wish to
void this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $4,882.16 if the payment is made on or before May 31, 2018, or
ii)       $5,821.15 if the payment is made on or before June 30, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after July 1, 2018
but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
