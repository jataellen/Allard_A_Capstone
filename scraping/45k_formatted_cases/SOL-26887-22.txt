Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26887-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


2ND FLOOR
ROOM 3, 43 MCCURDY ROAD GUELPH ON N1G4Z9


 




Between:


Andrey Vasin


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Matthew Addis


Tenant



 
 
 
Andrey Vasin (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Matthew Addis (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by
the Board on January 11, 2022 with respect to application SOL-24424-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order: The Tenant or their guest on January 15
and 16 2022 from 11:00 pm to 1:00 am made loud
noises by talking
and having the TV loud.
They used abusive
language, and it was disturbing. Other Tenants
complained as the Tenant did not allow them to sleep at night. On January 23
and 24, after 11:00 pm and until past 2:00 am the Tenant was playing video
games loudly and talking loudly with someone and screaming. The other Tenants
also complained about the Tenants behaviour and stated that Mr. Addis’s
behaviour affects their mental physical health as they cannot sleep at night.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SOL-24424-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 20, 2022.
3.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 20, 2022, then starting
February 21, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.




File Number: SOL-26887-22
 
4.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 21, 2022.
