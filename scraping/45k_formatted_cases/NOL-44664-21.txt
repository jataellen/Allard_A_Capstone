Greater Sudbury Housing
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Diana Reynolds and Aaron Gomez
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in
the mediated settlement issued by the Board on June 20, 2018 with respect to
application NOL-31698-18.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The mediated settlement provided that the Landlord
could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the
Tenants did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the settlement.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants have not met the following
condition specified in the settlement: The Tenant’s breached
the agreement and left dog feces all over the yard as per affidavit and pictures on December 13,
2021 and on December 21, 2021
 
 
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 29, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 29, 2022, then starting
January 30, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
