File Number: TEL-19804-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


504, 1765 VICTORIA PARK AVENUE
  SCARBOROUGH ON M1R1S5


 




Between:


Midland Place
Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Alison Stilling Regg Peterson


Tenants



 
 
 
Midland Place Inc (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Regg Peterson and Alison Stilling (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
19, 2022. The Landlord's Legal Representative, Sara Mathew, and
the Tenant, Alison Stilling, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 24, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,575.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,575.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from September 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020.
 
6.    
The Tenants paid $6,300.00
after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the




File Number: TEL-19804-21
 
Tenants, and find that it
would not be unfair to postpone
the eviction until February 15,
2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 15, 2022.
 
2.    
As of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears
of rent and compensation the
Landlord is entitled to by $171.34*.
 
3.     However, the Landlord
is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenants: $51.78
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 28, 2022 to
the date the Tenants move out of the unit, and $201.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.     The Landlord or the Tenants
shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a
result of this order.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 15, 2022, then starting
February 16, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 16, 2022.
 
7.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$1,776.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$3,351.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 15, 2022**.
If the Tenants
do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 16, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
