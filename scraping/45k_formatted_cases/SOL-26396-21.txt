Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26396-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


50 CHARING CROSS
STREET BRANTFORD ON N3R2H3


 




Between:


Veena Nikore C/o J.a.b. Legal
Services


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Angela Devuyst Staci Devusyt-Bacon


Tenants



 
 
 
Veena Nikore C/o
J.a.b. Legal Services (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Staci Devusyt-Bacon and Angela Devuyst (the 'Tenants') and
for an order to have the Tenants
pay the rent they
owe because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the
Board on September 2, 2021 with respect to application SOL-22361- 21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenants
have not met the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenants failed to pay $500.00 towards
the arrears on or before
November 1, 2021. The
Tenants failed to pay the lawful monthly rent in full on or before November 1,
2021.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order
required the Tenants
to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenants were
ordered to pay $5,586.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the
Landlord's application fee in Order SOL-22361-21. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $4,586.00 and that amount
is included in this order.
As a result, the previous order SOL-22361-21 is cancelled.




 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenants
have failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from November 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.
 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,350.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit has been paid to the Tenant
up to December 31, 2020,
which is included in this order.
There is no further interest owing since there was no guideline rent increase
allowed (consequently no interest) in 2021 due to COVID19
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Order SOL-22361-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 16, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord $6,009.04*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 5, 2022 and the costs
related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to
the Landlord $44.38 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 6, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January
16, 2022, the Tenants will start
to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from
January 17, 2022 at .00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January
17, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 17, 2022.

The tenant has until January 15, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 15, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.
 
In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on July 17, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction
where the rental unit is located.
