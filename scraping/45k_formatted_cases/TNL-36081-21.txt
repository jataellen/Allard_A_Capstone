Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-36081-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


31 GLENARDEN CRESCENT RICHMOND HILL ON L4B2G6


 




Between:


Wei Huang
  Zhijiang Lu


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Hamidreza Pirmoradi
  Maryam Pourkhajeh


Tenants



 
 
Wei Huang and
Zhijiang Lu (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Hamidreza Pirmoradi and Maryam Pourkhajeh (the 'Tenants') because the
Landlords have entered into an agreement of purchase and sale of the rental
unit and the purchaser requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 13, 2022.
 
The Landlords, the Landlords’ witness E. Lu, the Landlords’ Representative V. Guo, the Tenant Hamireza Pirmoradi and the Tenants’
Representative S. Emam attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlords served the Tenants with a Form N12
seeking termination of the tenancy because the purchaser requires possession of the rental unit for residential occupation, in accordance with section 49(1)(a) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”).
 
2.    
The Landlords entered into an
Agreement of Purchase and Sale, with an anticipated closing date of April 19,
2022.
 
3.    
The Landlords’ Form N12 was served
November 18, 2021 and contains a termination date of February 9, 2022. I am
satisfied the Landlord has met the 60-day notice requirement of s.50(2) of the Act, the declaration requirement
of s.72(1)(b) of the Act, and the
one month’s compensation requirement under the Act. The monthly rent for the rental
unit is $3,577.00.
 
4.     The Tenants do not dispute that the Landlords have
entered into an agreement of purchase and sale of the rental unit and that the
purchaser requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation.




 
Section 83
 
5.    
The issue to be decided in this case is the eviction date.
 
6.    
The Landlords advised they would be
agreeable to a termination date of March 9, 2022, being one month after the
Landlord’s Form N12 termination date of February 9, 2022.
 
7.     An eviction date of March 9, 2022 would provide the
Landlords with time to prepare the home for its eventual sale and would help
ensure they can deliver vacant possession to the new purchaser on April 19,
2022. The Landlords also indicated
that the property has been for sale since March 2021 and thus the Landlords’
intention to sell the property has been well known to the Tenants.
 
8.     The Tenants requested a termination date of April 15,
2022, stating they are actively seeking other accommodations and that the
additional time will provide them with “peace of mind”. The Tenants submit they have been good tenants since November
2018 and have 2 children and parents living with them.
 
9.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act. Since the Tenants
were served with the Landlord’s Form N12 approximately 3 months ago and since their need for an extension beyond March
9, 2022 is merely speculative, I find that it would be unfair to postpone the
eviction date beyond the Landlord’s proposed extended eviction date of March 9,
2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated, as of
March 9, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 9, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 9, 2022, then starting March 10, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after March 10, 2022.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order

date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial
jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
