Westcan Income
Lp2 (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Michelle Lucier (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes; and because she, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone she permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant..
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on November 1, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Tim Currie, attended
the hearing. As of 11:08 a.m., the
Tenant was not present or represented at the
hearing although properly
served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
June 1, 2015 to June 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a
Notice of Termination effective June 1, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The Landlord
sold the residential complex on July 1, 2021. Accordingly, this order is for
arrears and costs only and not eviction.
 
4.     The lawful monthly
rent is $438.60.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
It is
ordered that:

$9,165.89*, which represents the amount of rent
owing up to June 30, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.

does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
