Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-24311-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


814, 275 BLEECKER STREET TORONTO ON M4X1M1


 




Between:


Toronto Community Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Eleni Aregay
  Rut Aregay


Tenants



 
 
 
Toronto Community Housing
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Rut Aregay and Eleni Aregay
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
12, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Rahel Abera, attended the hearing. As of 10:49 a.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2020 to January
31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective January 4, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $663.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants paid $2,300.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.




File Number: TSL-24311-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 1, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$2,471.50*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 18, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $21.80 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 19,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before March 1, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from March 2,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 1, 2022, then
starting March 2, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 2, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$2,898.70 if the payment
is made on or before February 28, 2022, or
ii)             
$3,561.70 if the payment
is made on or before
March 1, 2022**.
If the Tenants
do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after March 2, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants
are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
