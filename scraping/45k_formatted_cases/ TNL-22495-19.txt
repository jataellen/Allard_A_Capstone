Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-22495-19
 










 
 
 

MC
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict MAA
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on March 3, 2020.
 
The Landlord’s representative, SK, and the Tenant attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from October 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective November 8, 2019.
 
2.      Although
the Tenant asserted at the hearing that she paid rent to the Landlord in
October 2019, I find that the Tenant’s evidence lacks credibility.  The Tenant
agreed at the hearing that she did not have a receipt for her October 2019
payment to the Landlord, or any other reliable evidence that rent was paid that
month.  The Tenant testified that she did not bring the evidence, but could get
it later.  The Tenant, however, did have with her receipts for rent payments
for the period November 1, 2019 to February 29, 2020.
 
3.      I
draw a negative inference from the Tenant’s failure to bring evidence to the
hearing of her October 2019 rent payment.  The Tenant knew as early as October
2019 that the Landlord claimed rent arrears starting in that month, when the
Tenant received the Landlord’s notice of termination.  The Tenant is also
deemed to have received the Landlord’s application and the Board’s notice for
the March 3, 2020 hearing on January 2, 2020.  The Tenant therefore had ample
time and opportunity to gather evidence for the hearing.  The Tenant’s evidence
at the hearing that she had rent receipts from November 2019 to February 2020,
but not for October 2019, is not credible.   
 
4.      I
therefore conclude that the Landlord proved, on a balance of probabilities,
that the Tenant did not pay rent to the Landlord in October 2019 and in March
2020.  The Tenant agreed at the hearing that she had not paid rent for March
2020, as of the hearing date.
 
5.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $2,000.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 1, 2019 to
November 8, 2019.
 
7.      The
Tenant paid $6,000.00 after the application was filed.
 
8.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until March 25, 2020,
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
9.      At
the hearing, the Tenant requested an order permitting her to pay the amount she
owes 20 days after the order is issued.  Although the Landlord’s representative
requested an order requiring the Tenant to pay the amount in 11 days, I find
that the Tenant’s request is reasonable.  The Tenant has demonstrated good
faith by paying $6,000.00 after the application was filed, and postponing the
eviction/voiding date to March 25, 2020 will not result in the accrual of
additional rent arrears. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before March 25, 2020.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $271.61*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to March 5, 2020, less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $65.75 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting March 6, 2020 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March
25, 2020, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from March 26, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before March 25, 2020, then starting March 26,
2020, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 26, 2020.
 
8.      If,
on or before March 25, 2020, the Tenant pays the amount of $4,190.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after March 26, 2020 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
