Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-04555-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


1508, 215 QUEEN STREET
E BRAMPTON ON L6W0A9


 




Between:


Muhammad-ali Sabir


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Eli Howell Kimbarley Bowen


Tenants



 
 
 
Muhammad-ali Sabir (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Eli Howell and Kimbarley Bowen (the 'Tenants') and for an order
to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on February 2,
2022 with respect to application HOL-11830-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants
have not met the following condition specified in the order: The Tenant failed to pay the
lawful monthly rent in full, on or before February 1, 2022.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order
required the Tenants
to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $5,826.00 for rent
arrears and NSF cheque charges and the costs related to the Landlord's
application fee in Order HOL-11830-21. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $4,600.00 and that amount is included
in this order. As a result,
the previous order HOL-11830-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from February 1, 2022 to February 28, 2022.
6.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,900.00
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.




File Number: CEL-04555-22
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from May 21, 2021 to
February 18, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order HOL-11830-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before March 1, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$2,624.38*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to February 18, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $62.47 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 19,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before March 1, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 2, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 1, 2022, then starting
March 2, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 2, 2022.
