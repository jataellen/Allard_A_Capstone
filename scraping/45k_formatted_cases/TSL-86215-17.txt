Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-86215-17
 










 
 
 

TCHC
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict LQ
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on December 6, 2017.  The Landlord’s
representatives JK and FF attended the hearing as did the Tenant.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from November 1, 2013 to December 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective March 24, 2017.
2.      The
Tenant wanted to raise maintenance issues pursuant to section 82 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) but her prior disclosure of those issues to
the Landlord mentioned no dates or times.  This made it impossible for the
Landlord to know exactly what the Tenant was alleging.  In addition, it
appeared that at least some of the photographs upon which the Tenant wanted to
rely at the hearing were taken well outside of the one year limitation period
imposed by subsection 29(2) of the Act and confirmed by the Divisional
Court in Toronto Community Housing Corporation v. Vlahovich,
[2010] O.J. No. 1463.
3.      It
might also have been the case that the Tenant’s photographs refer to the
circumstances of the rental unit as it exists now, but the Landlord’s evidence
would have been that the Tenant had refused access for the Landlord to assess
the current condition of the rental unit.
4.      In
any event, it should not have been up to the Landlord to guess what it was that
the Tenant was alleging when.  The Tenant’s section 82 issues were not,
therefore, considered and the Tenant can raise them in application(s) of her
own.
5.      The
Tenant wanted to dispute her rent-geared-to-income (RGI) determinations, but
subsection 203(a) of the Act provides that “the Board shall not make
determinations or review decisions concerning eligibility for RGI assistance as
defined in section 38 of the Housing Services Act, 2011 (‘HSA’) or any
amount of geared-to-income rent payable under that Act.”  As the RGI assistance
was payable pursuant to the HSA and not another statute or a Transfer
Agreement, the Divisional Court’s recent decision in Belair v. Ontario
Aboriginal Housing Services Corporation, 2017 ONSC 2839, which said the
Landlord and Tenant Board could make such determinations if such assistance was
not pursuant to the HSA, did not apply.
6.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Act and find that it would not be unfair to grant
relief from eviction subject to  the conditions set out in this order pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.  This was relief suggested by the
Landlord that was both possible for the Tenant to comply with given her current
monthly income and very reasonable where it would take over seven years for the
Tenant to satisfy all of the arrears of rent.
7.      Nevertheless,
the Tenant’s position appeared to be that no rent was owing or payable, and
that she would pay nothing.  However, without any section 82 issues to reduce
the arrears, without any authority to deal with RGI issues and without any
evidence of errors in the Landlord’s calculations, the Tenant’s position was
untenable.  Moreover, the Tenant may want to reconsider her position if she
wants to preserve this tenancy where it is unlikely such liberal relief would
be proposed or granted in the event of any subsequent motion to set aside an
order.
8.      The
total amount owing is $9,366.00, which includes $9,176.00 for arrears of rent
and $190.00 for the filing fee.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      It
is ordered that the Tenant shall pay the Landlord $9,366.00 for arrears up to March
31, 2018 and the filing fee.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay the amount set out in paragraph one as follows: $100.00 on or
before the first day of every month from April 1, 2018 to October 1, 2025 and
$76.00 on or before November 1, 2025.
3.      The
Tenant shall pay the Landlord the monthly rent due on or before the first day
of the month for the period April 1, 2018 to November 1, 2025.
4.      If
the Tenant fails to make any of the payments under paragraphs two or three
above in full, the Landlord may collect the entire outstanding balance from the
amount set out in paragraph one immediately.


 
5.      If
the Tenant fails to make any of the payments in paragraphs two or three above,
the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Act, within 30 days of the
breach and without notice to the Tenant, for an order terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenant, and requiring the Tenant to pay any new arrears of
rent and NSF fees and related charges that become owing after March 31, 2018.
