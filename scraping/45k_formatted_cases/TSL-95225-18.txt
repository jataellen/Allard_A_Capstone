Order under Section 21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-95225-18-RV
 
Review Order
 
T.C.H.C
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict I.H
and N.M (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This
application was resolved by order TSL-95225-18 issued on October 5, 2018.
 
On
October 15, 2018, the Tenants requested a review of the order, and that the
order be stayed until the request to review is resolved. 
 
On
October 16, 2018, order TSL-95225-18-RV-IN was issued, staying the order issued
on October 5, 2018.
 
The
request to review was heard in Toronto on January 28, 2019.
 
The
Landlord’s representative F.F and the Tenant N.M attended the hearing.
            
Reasons:
 
Procedural history
 
1.      The
Tenant’s rent was subsidized pursuant to the Housing Services Act, 2011,
SO 2011, c 6, Sch 1 (HSA).  This application concerns rent arrears that arose
because the Landlord revoked the Tenant’s subsidy, which resulted in the rent
increasing from around $330 to $1,667.00 monthly.  The Tenant was not able to
pay the unsubsidized rent, and arrears started to accrue.
2.      The
Landlord filed the application on May 1, 2018.  The matter came before the
Board on June 4, June 25, and July 30, and was adjourned each time on consent
to give the Tenant more time to resolve the loss of his subsidy.  The Landlord
required the Tenant to submit more income information in order to restore the
subsidy.
3.      The
matter was next scheduled for October 1, 2018.  The Tenant did not attend the
hearing, and the matter was heard in his absence.  Since his subsidy had not
been restored, the Board issued a standard order requiring payment of the full
arrears, and terminating the tenancy if the arrears were not paid.
4.      The
Tenant then retained a lawyer, and filed a request to review the order on the
basis that he was not reasonably able to participate in the October 1 hearing. 
He alleged that he missed the hearing because of a medical condition.  The
review was scheduled to be heard on November 6.
5.      On
November 6, the matter was again adjourned on consent to give the Tenant more
time to resolve the loss of his subsidy.
6.      The
matter came before me on January 28, 2019, nearly eight months after the application
was filed.  The Tenant’s subsidy has not, at this point, been restored.
Review
7.      The
Landlord consents to the review request.  Accordingly, I granted the review and
heard the matter de novo.
Adjournment
request
8.      The
Tenant’s lawyer did not attend the hearing.  The Tenant stated that his lawyer
told him that the hearing would be once again adjourned, because he had not yet
received a document that he needed to give the Landlord in respect of his
subsidy.
9.      I
find it highly unlikely that the Tenant’s lawyer would have given him that
advice.  However, I took him to be asking that the matter be adjourned to give
him more time to resolve the loss of his subsidy.  The Landlord opposed the
request.
10.   I
denied the adjournment request.  Pursuant to subsection 203(a) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘RTA’), the Board does not have the jurisdiction
to determine whether the Tenant qualifies for a rent subsidy.  Those decisions
are made under the HSA, which has its own review process.
11.   In this
case, the decision to revoke the Tenant’s subsidy was made on November 8,
2017.  He has had more than a year to seek to overturn that decision, either by
giving the Landlord the documents it requires or by seeking a review under the
HSA.  The decision has not been overturned, remains in effect, and is binding
on the Board.  I can see no basis for adjourning this matter any further when,
as a matter of law, the lawful rent has been determined.
Arrears
12.   The
Tenant does not dispute the accuracy of the Landlord’s records.  He owes
$16,089.00 in rent arrears to January 31, 2019.  He also owes the Landlord its
filing fee of $190.00.
Subsection
83(1)(a)
13.   Pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(a) of the RTA, eviction for rent arrears is often denied on
the condition that a tenant repay the arrears on a payment plan.  At the
hearing, I asked the Tenant repeatedly whether he was seeking a payment plan. 
The Tenant initially stated, several times, that he could not afford to pay his
arrears.  Eventually, he took the position that he could pay a total of $500.00
monthly.
14.   Since
the Tenant’s rent is $1,667.00, his proposed payment plan would not pay his
arrears, and would instead cause further arrears of $1,167.00 of to accrue each
month.  It would obviously be unfair to the Landlord to permit the tenancy to
continue, and accordingly, I ruled that relief would not be granted under
subsection 83(1)(a).
15.   After
I made that ruling, the Tenant changed his position and said that he could pay
$2,167.00 monthly.  I declined to hear that request.  The Tenant had already
had several opportunities to request a payment plan, and had clearly taken the
position that all he could pay was $500.00.  The issue was decided on that
basis.  A party may not seek a second finding on an issue that has already been
decided.
Subsection
83(1)(b)
16.   I
then asked the Tenant repeatedly whether he was asking for eviction to be
postponed under subsection 83(1)(b) of the RTA.  The Tenant refused to answer.
17.   Since
relief under subsection 83(1)(b) is not being sought, a standard eleven-day
order will issue.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
request to review is granted. Order TSL-95225-18 issued on October 5, 2018 is
cancelled and replaced by the following order.
2.      Unless
the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before February 10, 2019.
3.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $16,034.19*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to January 30, 2019.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $54.81 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting January 31, 2019 to the date the Tenants move out of
the unit.
5.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 10, 2019, then starting February
11, 2019, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 11,
2019.
8.      If
the Tenants wish to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenants must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $16,279.00 if the payment is made on or before January 31, 2019, or
ii)       $17,946.00 if the payment is made on or before February 10, 2019**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after February 11, 2019 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to
the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
