Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-99299-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


2605 DRUMMOND CON 10A LANARK ON
  K0G1K0


 




Between:


George And Mary Oliver


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Derek Pratt Wanetta
Generoux


Tenants



 
 
 
On February 4, 2022, George And
Mary Oliver (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Derek Pratt and Wanetta Generoux (the 'Tenants') and for an order to
have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on June 4,
2021 with respect to application EAL-92011-20
.
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants have not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenants did not pay $1000.00 rent on or before February
1, 2022. The Tenants did not pay $300.00 arrears on or before
February 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay
rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $7,500.00 for rent arrears
in Order EAL-92011-20. The amount that is still owing from that order is $4,286.00 and
that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order EAL-92011-20
is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that
became owing for the period from
February 1, 2022 to February 28, 2022.




File Number: EAL-99299-22
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order EAL-92011-20 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before March 6, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$5,042.16*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to February 23, 2022.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$32.88 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 24,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before March 6, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 7, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 6, 2022, then starting
March 7, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 7, 2022.
