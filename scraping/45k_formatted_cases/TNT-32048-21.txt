Order under Section 31
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNT-32048-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


SECOND FLOOR,
13 TUSCARORA DR NORTH YORK ON M2H2K4


 




Between:


Nathalie Mengyu
  Wei


Tenant




 


 
and


 




 


Ying Wang


Landlord



 
 
 
Nathalie Mengyu Wei (the
'Tenant') applied for an order determining that Ying Wang (the 'Landlord')
harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with the Tenant,
entered the rental unit illegally and substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or
residential complex by the Tenant or by a member of the Tenant's household.
This application was heard by videoconference on February 17, 2022.
The Tenant and the Landlord attended the hearing.
.
Determinations:
 
1.     For the reasons that follow I find that the Landlord
did not harassed, substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental
unit or residential complex by the
Tenant or enter the rental unit illegally.
 
2.     The Tenant testified that she moved into the rental
unit on December 26, 2020 and vacated January 1, 2021; the unit was a co-tenancy arrangement whereby each had their own tenancy agreement and the
common areas were shared. She vacated because between the period December 26 to
29, 2020 the other 2 co-tenants were spraying the COVID-19 virus from an
aerosol can into the common area bathroom and on her belongings in her room.
The co-Tenants also left 2 drops of blood by the front door; this would have
also been infected with the virus and terrified her.
 
3.     The Tenant also testified that when she told the Landlord about what they were doing all
the Landlord told the was to wash their clothes and clean the bathroom.
 
4.     The Tenant did not provide any medical or scientific
evidence that the COVID-19 virus could be bought/contained in aerosol cans and
passed on by this means, therefore, based on
insufficient evidence this part of the Tenant’s application is dismissed.
As there is no evidence that parts of the rental
unit and the Tenant’s belongings were infected with




File Number: TNT-32048-21
 
COVID-19 the portion of the
application with respect to 2 drops of COVID-19 infected blood is also dismissed. Further, as there is no evidence of the virus being spread in the rental unit or the Tenant’s bedroom,
the part of the application in regard to illegal
entries must also be dismissed.
 
5.     This order contains
all the reasons
for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.
