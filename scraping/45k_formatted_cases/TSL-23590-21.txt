In the matter
of:


6, 11 BIRCHLEA AVENUE ETOBICOKE ON M8W1E8


 




Between:


Lakeshore Realty
Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Anthony Tanzola
  Naka Naidovski


Tenants



 
 
Lakeshore Realty Ltd. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Naka Naidovski
and Anthony Tanzola
(the 'Tenants') because the Tenants, another
occupant of the rental unit
or someone the Tenants permitted in the residential complex has substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another tenant.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 16, 2021 at 12:14pm.
 
Only the Landlord attended
the hearing. The Landlord
was represented by George Margie.
 
I note the Tenant joined the videoconference at 12:45pm after the matter had already
been disposed of.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s L2 application is
based on a second, non-voidable N5 notice of termination served to the Tenants
on July 8, 2021 with a termination date of July 24, 2021. The N5 was served pursuant
to subsection 68(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act) which reads:
 
68 (1) A landlord
may give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy
if,
 
(a)              
a notice of termination was given to the tenant
under section 62, 64 or 67; and
 
(b)              
more than seven days but less than
six months after the notice mentioned in clause (a) was given to the tenant, an
activity takes place, conduct occurs
or a situation arises that constitutes grounds for a notice
of termination under section 60, 61, 62, 64 or 67, other than an activity,
conduct or a situation that is described in subsection 61 (1)




 
and that involves an illegal act, trade, business
or occupation described in
clause 61 (2) (a).
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
2.     Thus, in order
to serve a second N5 notice of termination pursuant
to subsection 68(1),
a landlord must have previously served a valid first N5 notice of
termination.
 
3.     The N5 notice
of termination that preceded
this N5 was served to the Tenants
on April 12, 2021 with a
termination date of May 5, 2021. The first N5 notice was pursuant to section 64
of the Act which reads:
 
64 (1) A landlord may
give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy if the conduct of the tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or a person permitted
in the residential complex by the tenant is such that it substantially
interferes with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex for all
usual purposes by the landlord or another tenant or substantially interferes
with another lawful right, privilege or interest of the landlord or another
tenant. 2006, c. 17, s. 64 (1).
 
(2)    
A
notice of termination under subsection (1) shall,
(a)              
provide a termination date not earlier
than the 20th day after
the notice is given;
(b)              
set out the grounds
for termination; and
(c)              
require the tenant, within seven days, to stop the conduct
or activity or correct the
omission set out in the notice.
(3)    
The notice of termination under
subsection (1) is void if the tenant, within seven days after receiving the notice, stops the conduct
or activity or corrects the omission.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
4.     The Landlords’ first N5 notice of termination is
invalid as it fails to describe the reasons for the notice; instead,
it lists a month and year and goes on to provide verbs describing the type of noise from the Tenants’ unit.
 
5.     The Landlord submits
that this is because there were many verbal complaints received by the
Landlord but agrees that the details on the notice of termination were vague.
 
6.     The need for a notice to contain “reasons and details”
was addressed by the Divisional Court decision Ball v. Metro Capital
Property, [2002] O.J. No. 5931 which stands for the proposition that the kinds of
particulars that should be contained
in a notice include “dates
and times of the alleged offensive conduct together with a detailed description
of the alleged conduct engaged in by the tenant”. The purpose of providing
these details is not only to inform a tenant but to allow them to respond to the
application.
 
7.     The N5 notice here clearly does not provide sufficient
details. It does not indicate the specific dates of the complaints so as to inform the Tenant of the specific
occurrences




 
that substantially interfered with others’ reasonable enjoyment of the premises – as it is
alleged.
 
8.    
Without a valid first N5 notice
of termination, the second N5 is defective and the Landlords’ L2
application must be dismissed.
 
9.     This order contains
all of the reasons for my decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
