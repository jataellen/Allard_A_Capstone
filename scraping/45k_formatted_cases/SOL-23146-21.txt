Order under Section 94
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-23146-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


501, 380 COCHRANE ROAD HAMILTON ON L8K6H8


 




Between:


C. Valery Construction


Landlord




 


 
And


 




 


Alisa
  Cole


Tenant



 
 
C. Valery
Construction (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
terminating the tenancy
and evicting Alisa Cole (the
'Tenant') the Tenant because the Tenant’s employment as a superintendent ended.
 
This application was heard by video conference on October 13,
2021.
 
Only the Landlord’s legal agent, Kelly Booth, attended
the hearing. By 10:38 a.m., the
Tenant did not attend the hearing,
though properly served with the Notice of Hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant was still in possession of the rental
unit as of the date the application was filed.
 
2.     The Tenant’s employment as a superintendent with the Landlord ended on July 7, 2021.
 
3.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of
the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find
that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 17, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 17, 2022, then starting
January 18, 2022 the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 18, 2022.




File Number: SOL-23146-21
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before January 17, 2022,
the Tenant will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 18, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
