Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-36236-21
 



In the matter
of:


MAIN FLOOR, 78 FELAN CRESCENT ETOBICOKE ON M9V3A3


 




Between:


Satbir Gill


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Kingsley Akhigbe
Rita Kingsley Akhigbe


Tenants



 
 
On November 16,
2021, Satbir Gill (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Rita Kingsley Akhigbe
and Kingsley Akhigbe
(the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because
the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the
Board on October 25, 2021 with respect to application TNL-33567-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenants have not met the following
condition(s) specified in the order:
 
The Tenants failed
to pay to the Landlord $1,000.00 on or before
November 12, 2021 towards
arrears of rent.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenants
were ordered to pay $9,586.00 for rent arrears
in Order TNL-33567-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $7,586.00 and
that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order
TNL-33567-21 is cancelled.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TNL-33567-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 18, 2022.

3.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$7,586.00*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to November 30, 2021.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $62.47
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting December 1, 2021
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
18, 2022, the Tenants will start
to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from
January 19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January
19, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 19, 2022.

The tenant has until January 17, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 17, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.
 
In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on July 19, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction
where the rental unit is located.
