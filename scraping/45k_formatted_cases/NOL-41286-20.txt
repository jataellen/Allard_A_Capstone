In the matter of:      205, 744 BRUCE AVENUE

Between:                  Greater Sudbury Housing Corporation                                    Landlord

Lorraine Mathieu William Dean


Tenants




 
 
 
Greater Sudbury Housing
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Lorraine
Mathieu and William
Dean (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on June 10,
2021.
 
The Landlord and the former Tenant,
Lorraine Mathieu, attended
the hearing. As of 10:22 a.m., the Tenant, William Dean, was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from June 1, 2018 to June 30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective October 23, 2020.
 
2.    
At the hearing, the former Tenant,
Lorraine Mathieu, confirmed that she vacated the rental unit and notified
the Landlord on May 27, 2021. The Landlord confirmed
that the only Tenant currently
residing in the rental unit is William Dean.
 
3.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. Based on the uncontested evidence
presented by the Landlord at the hearing, I find that the Tenant, William Dean,
failed to pay his rent in full. I have no reason to deny the eviction requested
by the Landlord.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before February 21, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $11,775.03*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 10, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $13.48
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 11,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
21, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 22, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 21, 2022, then starting
February 22, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 22, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before February 21,
2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $12,218.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 22, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
