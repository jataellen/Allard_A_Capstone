Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-97407-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


2064 DUNDAS STREET CARDINAL ON K0E1E0


 




Between:


Wendy Gates


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Garrett Spicer Mandelle Young


Tenants



 
 
 
Wendy Gates (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Garrett
Spicer and Mandelle Young (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict the Tenants because they, another occupant
of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the damage;
and because the Landlord
requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the
unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on December 20, 2021. Only the Landlord
and the Landlord’s legal
representative, D. Fernadez-Stoll attended the hearing.
 
Preliminary Issue:
 
1.   
As of 9:21 a.m.,
the Tenants were not present
or represented although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board. As such, the matter
proceeded as uncontested. After the hearing block concluded, at 12:38 p.m., the Tenant,
M. Young, called
into the hearing
room. She stated that she had broke her phone and had been trying to
call into the hearing room with two phones that she borrowed since 8:30 am. and
was only now successful.
 
2.   
The Notice
of Hearing provides
both a video conference line and a telephone line to call into
the hearing to participate. The Notice of Hearing also states that:
 
If you cannot participate in the hearing,
you should give someone written
permission to represent you and to participate on your behalf and email it to the Board in advance.




 
3.   
The Tenants
had an obligation to attend the hearing,
or find another to participate on their behalf, but
they did not. The Landlord’s application proceeded as uncontested.
Determinations:
 
L1 Application
 
4.   
The Tenants have not paid the
total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to December
31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective July 27, 2021.
 
5.   
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
 
6.   
The lawful
monthly rent is $780.00.
 
7.   
The Landlord
is not holding a last month's rent deposit.
 
8.   
The Tenants
paid $780.00 after the application was filed.
 
9.   
Pursuant to section 83(6),
I am required to consider
whether the Landlord
made attempts to negotiate a payment agreement with the
Tenants. The Landlord submitted that conversations were had with the Tenants on
October 28, 2021. The Tenants replied with their intent to enter a payment
agreement, but nothing formalized. I am satisfied that the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a payment agreement with the Tenants.
 
L2 Application
 
N12 Notice
 
10. The Landlord applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants because the Landlord requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The termination date in the N12 is September 30, 2021. In the notice,
the Landlord indicated that she was seeking to
terminate the tenancy for her own use.
 
11. The Landlord provided the Tenants
compensation equivalent to one month’s rent on June 25, 2021 and June 28, 2021.
 
12. The Landlord filed her Declaration dated
October 29, 2021. It states that she in good faith personally requires the
rental unit for a period of at least one year.
 
Good Faith
 
13.
The only remaining issue
to be determined is whether
the Landlord requires
the unit in good
faith.
 
14.
The Landlord bears the
obligation to prove the good faith
requirement and is required to establish that the person purporting to
live there genuinely intends to live in the rental unit




 
for at least one year. The
Landlord’s motives are only relevant as evidence from which inferences can be
drawn when deciding whether a genuine or sincere intention to occupy the unit
exists [Fava v. Harrison, [2014] O.J. No. 2678 (Div. Ct); Salter v. Beljinac, 2001 CanLII 40231 (ON SCDC), [2001]
O.J. No. 2792 (Div. Ct.)].
 
15. The Landlord testified that she purchased
the unit with the intent of using it as her primary residence. She also purchased the adjoining property. Her daughter and her children
will be residing in that unit. This will allow them to be closer together, reduce costs and enjoy more space than their previous home. She
testified that while she awaits to take possession of the unit, she is living
in an apartment with her daughter and grandson on the couch. She intends to
move into the unit immediately, will reside in the rental unit full-time and
for a period of at least one year.
 
16. I am therefore satisfied on the balance of
probabilities, that the Landlord in good
faith requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation and she genuinely intends to reside in the rental unit and for a
period of one year.
 
N5 Notice
 
17. The Landlord also applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants because they, another occupant of
the rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex
have wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises. The N5 notice was served on the tenant on July 7, 2021. The
Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenants to compensate the
Landlord for the damage
 
18. The N5 notice
alleges that an RV backed
into the hydro
meter for the rental unit and the cost
to repair the damage was $1,192.15. An invoice from Plante Electric Ltd. was
attached to the N5 notice, outlining this amount. Photographs of the damage
were submitted into evidence. The Landlord testified that she received a call
from M. Young regarding this incident. She testified that she received
an email dated December 17, 2021 where
M. Young states her friend
backed into the hydro meter with his RV by accident and blamed the poor lighting. Within
seven days of the notice
being served on the Tenants,
the Landlord testified that the Tenants did not pay the
Landlord for the damage.
 
19. In order to be successful in the damages claim, the Landlord, as the applicant, must establish all of the elements of sections 62 and 89 of the Act. It must be established that a tenant,
an occupant of the rental unit or a person the tenant permitted in the
complex negligently or willfully caused undue damage to the rental unit or
complex.
 
20. On a balance of probabilities, I find that
the Tenant and/or a person she permitted in the residential complex
negligently caused undue
damage. The damages
are well-documented in the photographs. The Landlord’s uncontested evidence was that M. Young conceded the damage was caused by her friend backing up his RV into the hydro meter. I am also satisfied the Tenants did not void the
notice by paying for the damage within seven days.
 
21. Regarding the Landlord’s claim for
compensation for damages, I am satisfied that the amount to repair the damage of $1,192.15 is reasonable. The invoice attached
to the N5




 
and submitted
into evidence outlines
that the power was restored
at the unit after an emergency call.
 
Relief from Eviction
 
22. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenants were not present to disclose any
circumstances for me to consider
delaying or denying eviction. As such, I find that no relief should be provided
to the Tenants.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
Regarding the L1:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental
unit on or before January 17, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $4,091.70*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 6, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $25.64 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 7, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 17, 2022, the
Tenants will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 18, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January 18, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord, on or after January 18, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 17, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $4,881.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after January 18,
2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenants are




 
only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
 
Regarding the L2:
 
10. 
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated, as of
January 17, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 17, 2022.
 
11. 
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $1,192.15, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing
the damage.
 
12. 
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before January
17, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January
18, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
13. 
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January 18, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
14. 
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after
January 18, 2022.
