In the matter
of:


1103, 177 REDPATH AVENUE TORONTO ON M4P2W3


 




Between:


North Edge Properties Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Dawn Miller


Tenant



 
 
 
North Edge Properties Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Dawn Miller (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant and wilfully or
negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the
unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord attended
the hearing. The Landlord
was represented by Geoff Paine and his instructing witness was Maria Fotiadis
(the ‘Operations Administrator’).
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
This application is about the state of the Tenant’s
bathroom and the Landlord’s efforts
to access the bathroom to do repairs.
 
2.    
For the reasons that follow, the application for an eviction
order based on the allegation of substantial interference is dismissed,
but eviction is granted on the basis of negligent or wilful damage. The
application for compensation under s. 89 is also granted.
 
3.    
The Tenant has lived in
the rental unit for about 19 years. The tenancy has been uneventful. But in the
summer of 2021 a leak occurred from the rental unit into the unit below. When
the Landlord went to the rental unit to investigate the leak it discovered the
Tenant’s bathroom was in a serious state of disrepair. From the photographs
filed with the Board it looks like
the Tenant has failed to clean the bathroom for many years and a biomass has accumulated causing
some areas to be coated with a carpet of black fibrous matter.




 
4.    
The Landlord
subsequently gave the Tenant notice
of entry for August 5, 2021, in order to start doing repairs to stop the leak
in the unit below. Despite having received valid notice the Tenant refused to
let the Landlord’s workers into her unit.
 
5.    
So the Landlord served
notice of termination on the Tenant
pursuant to sections
62 and 64 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) effective September 9, 2021.
 
6.    
Notices pursuant
to sections 62 and 64 are voidable.
 
7.    
In the case of a notice
under s. 62 for negligent or wilful damage,
a tenant can void by paying the reasonable costs of repair
or replacement claimed within seven days. The Landlord’s s. 62 notice here was
not voided. The Tenant has not paid the Landlord anything towards the
reasonable cost of repairing her bathroom.
 
8.    
Under s. 64 a notice of
termination is voided if the tenant stops the behavior complained of within the seven day period
following service. The behaviour complained of here is the
Tenant’s refusal to let the Landlord into the unit to work in the bathroom following
service of a valid notice of entry. The Landlord did not in fact attempt
re-entry until after the voiding period had passed. As a result, that part of
the notice of termination which is based on notice under s 64 was voided, and
the Landlord’s application for an eviction order cannot succeed based on it.
 
9.    
The photographs filed
into evidence establish that the Tenant’s behaviour in failing to clean the
bathroom has caused undue damage to the bathroom. The tub and tile surround need to be replaced and plaster work and painting
must be done. The faucet and shower head might be saved by
mould remediation and cleaning but the state of them suggests that would
probably cost more than simple replacement.
 
10.  The Landlord submitted a number of quotes
into evidence and the Operations Administrator
estimates that the repair work in the bathroom will cost $3,364.00. Based on the quotes provided and my knowledge of similar like
cases, I find that to be a reasonable amount for remediating the bathroom.
 
11.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
The Landlord indicates the Tenant is middle aged, appears able bodied and able
to pay the rent. It knows of no circumstances of the Tenant that would justify
relief from eviction. Under the circumstances, relief form eviction beyond the
standard delays inherent in the eviction process are simply not justifiable.
 
12.  Because an eviction order shall issue,
pursuant to s. 89(2) of the Act the Board is required to set off against the amount required
to be paid by the Tenant for the damage, the amount of any rent deposit or interest on the rent deposit that would be owing to the Tenant on
termination.
 
13.  The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,609.35 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord. Interest on the rent deposit is
owing to the Tenant for the




 
period from August 1, 2021 to September 9, 2021
in the amount of $0.18. These amounts total $1,609.53 which shall be
set off against the compensation awarded under s. 89 resulting in an amount
owing to the Landlord of $1,754.47.
 
14.  The Landlord incurred
costs of $186.00
for the cost of filing the application and is entitled to reimbursement of those costs.
 
15.  Finally
the Landlord’s application seeks daily compensation but the rent has been paid in full for the period ending December 31,
2022, so as of the date of hearing before the Board no daily compensation was
owing and there is no reason to suspect that the rent for the month of January,
2022 will not be paid. As a result, the Landlord withdrew the request for daily
compensation and none shall be ordered.
 
16.  This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It
is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
terminated effective September 9, 2021 pursuant to the Landlord’s notice of termination in Form
N5.
 
2.    
The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before January
16, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,754.47, which
represents the reasonable costs of repairing
the damage minus the Tenant’s
last month’s rent deposit and interest owing on the deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before January
16, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January
17, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 17, 2022.
