In the matter
of:


UPPER LEVEL, 7316 REDFOX ROAD
SOUTH MISSISSAUGA ON L4T2L8


 




Between:


Jit Singh
  Randhawa


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Geeta Kalra
Kailash Chand Kalra


Tenants



 
 
 
Jit Singh Randhawa (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Geeta Kalra and Kailash Chand Kalra (the
'Tenants') because the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for the
purpose of residential occupation.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the
unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on February 7, 2022.
 
The Landlord and the Landlord's Legal Representative Samila
Waslat and the first named
Tenant and the Tenant's Legal Representative Shahbaz Vardag attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.     The Landlord in good faith
requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
2.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,200.00
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
3.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
4.     The monthly rent is
$1,450.00.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from March 1, 2014 to
March 31, 2021.
 
6.     The Landlord paid the Tenant compensation equal to one
month's rent on February 1, 2021. The Tenant did not dispute that compensation was paid.
There was some dispute about
whether a cheque should be made an exhibit. If find this a moot point, as the
via




 
voica evidence from the Landlord,
the documentary evidence submitted by the Landlord and the Tenant providing
no evidence disputing they did not receive compensation. I find on a balance of probabilities
compensation was paid.
 
The
Evidence
 
7.     The Landlord served
the Tenant with a Notice
to Terminate the Tenancy at the End of the Term for Landlord’s Own Use (the
“N12” notice), on January 11, 2021. The N12 notice gave a termination date of
March 31, 2021. The N12 notice indicates the Landlord requires the rental unit
for “Child use”.
 
8.     The N12 Notice
was served pursuant
to section 48 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) which states:
 
(1)  
A
landlord may, by notice, terminate a tenancy if the landlord
in good faith
requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation for a period of at least one year by,
 
(a) the landlord; …
 
(2)  
The date of termination specified in the notice shall be at least 60 days after
the notice is given and shall be the day a period of the tenancy ends
or, where the tenancy is for a fixed term, the end of the term.
 
9.    
The N12 notice gives the Tenant
over 60 days’ notice and the termination date, March 31, 2021, is the day a period of the tenancy
ends. Therefore, the Landlord has complied
with s.48(2) of the Act.
 
10.  Section 48.1 of the Act requires a landlord who has
served an N12 notice to give the tenant compensation in the amount
of one month of rent.
Section 55.1 of the Act requires
a landlord who is obligated to give compensation to a tenant under s.48.1 to
pay that compensation no later than the termination date in the N12 notice.
 
11.  It is uncontested that the Tenant
was paid compensation prior to the termination date of
March 31, 2021 via cheque that was dated February 1, 2021.
 
12.  The main issue to be determined is whether the
Landlord has established that they in good faith require
possession of the rental unit for the residential occupation as required by section 48.1 of the “Act”.
 
13.  Section 48 has been
interpreted by the Courts as requiring only that a landlord establish that they genuinely intend
to move into the unit and live there for residential purposes
for at least one year (Feeney v. Noble, 1994 CanLII 10538 (ON
SC), [1994] O.J. No. 2049 (Div. Ct.)). Neither the reasonableness of the
Landlords’ intention, nor the fact that the Landlords may have other motives
for wanting to occupy the unit, nor the fact that there might be other
available alternatives is the issue (Salter v. Beljinac,2001 CanLII 40231
(ON SCDC), [2001] O.J. No. 2792 (Div. Ct.), and Feeney v. Noble). However,
the surrounding circumstances may provide circumstantial evidence from which
inferences




 
can be drawn when deciding whether
a genuine or sincere intention to occupy the unit
exists (Fava v. Harrison, [2014] O.J. No. 2678 (Div. Ct.)).
 
14.  The Landlord child Ms. Lovepreet Randhawa testified
that she is getting married on May 14, 2022. She wishes to occupy the upper
level of this rental property for her and her fiancé to live. She stated the
property has 3 bedrooms and stated she will be occupying the upper level for residential purposes. She stated her and her fiancé hope to save up in one to two years so that they can
purchase their own place. She was able to produce contracts for services to
show that she was getting married on May 14, 2022.
 
15.  The Tenant's Legal Representative Mr. Vardag
questioned where the receipts for wedding services and what was her method
of payment for services. I find nothing
turns on whether or not the Landlord’s daughter could produced receipts
for services or challenges the “good faith” test. The Tenant was unable to
provide any evidence to contradict Ms. Randhawa was getting married or that she
had contracted out wedding services.
 
16.  Mr. Vardag asked the Landlord’s daughter where the
affidavit for her fiancé is. I find nothing
turns on that question. There
is no requirement under the “Act”
for the fiancé to provide an
affidavit or any testimony.
 
17.  The Tenant testified that the Landlord
has served the N12 notice
in bad faith. She has been
living at the rental unit for 7 years and stated the Landlord has made living their difficult since 2019.
 
18.  The Tenant presented evidence of a text message on
November 10, 2020 that states “putting the house
for sale soon”,
and the photograph of a for sale sign allegedly taken from the front of the house on November 17, 2020.
 
19.  When I examined the Tenants, the text message was sent
on November 10, 2020, the Landlord served the N12 on the Tenant on January 11,
2021. The Tenant failed to establish how a
text message 2 months before the N12
was served was in bad faith. The photograph of a for sale sign in the front of
the house, the front of the residential property was not shown, nor was the
picture dated and the Tenant did not bring any other evidence to collaborate if the house went for sale (i.e. mls listing
or advertisement). When I examine that evidence further, the
Tenants own testimony was she was unaware if anyone came to see the property.
The Tenant failed to establish how the Landlord acted in “bad faith” months
prior to being served with the N12.
 
20.  When I review all the evidence, I am satisfied beyond
a balance of probabilities that the Landlord child, Ms. Randhawa genuinely
intends to occupy the rental unit for at least 12 months. I therefore find that
the Landlord has a good faith intention to possess the rental unit for the purposes
of residential occupation for at least 12 months.
The Tenant failed to
provide any evidence to contradict the Landlords testimony.
 
21.  I asked both parties about
submissions on eviction. The Landlord asked the Board to extend the eviction date to April 30,
2022. The Tenants states that her husband is disabled and was asking the Bord
to consider an extension to December 31, 2022.




 
22.  I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it
would not be unfair to postpone the eviction
until April 30, 2022 pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. I find
that the proposal of December 31, 2022 to be excessive. That would be over 21
months from the termination date of March 31, 2021 originally provided to the
Tenant in the N12 notice.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated, as of April 30, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the
rental unit on or before April 30, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $14,017.49 less
any amounts paid by the Tenants, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from April
1, 2021 to February 16, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $47.67
per day for compensation for the use of the unit from February 17, 2022 to
the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February 27, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 28, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
April 30, 2022, then starting
May 1, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after May 1, 2022.
