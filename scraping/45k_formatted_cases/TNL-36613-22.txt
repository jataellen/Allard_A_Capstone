Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-36613-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


409, 22 TINDER CRESCENT NORTH YORK ON M4A 1L6


 




Between:


22 Tinder
Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Crystal Powell


Tenant



 
 
 
22 Tinder Inc. (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Crystal Powell (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the
rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a
condition specified in the order issued by the Board on January 7, 2022 with
respect to application TNL-32425-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay the full monthly
rent on or before February 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or
all the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $1,551.88 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order TNL-32425-21. The amount that is still owing from that
order is $1,400.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result,
the previous order TNL-32425-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from January 1, 2022 to February 28, 2022.
 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,050.33 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.




File Number: TNL-36613-22
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021 to February 18, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order TNL-32425-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the
Tenant is terminated. The Tenant
must move out of the rental
unit on or before March 1, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$2,033.24*. This amount represents the rent owing up to February 18, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $34.79
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 19, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March 1, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 2, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 1, 2022, then starting
March 2, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 2, 2022.
