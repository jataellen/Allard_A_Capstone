Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number:
SWL-55452-21
 



In the matter
of:


107, 1616 OUELLETTE AVENUE WINDSOR ON N8X1L2


 




Between:


Metcap Living
Management Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Brooklyn Belanger
  Mattias Mahoukoo


Tenants



 
 
Metcap Living Management Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Mattias Mahoukoo and Brooklyn Belanger (the 'Tenants')
because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on January 13, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s Legal Representative,
Tricia Radam, attended the hearing. As of 1:53 p.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the
total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 26, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly rent is
$609.00.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $609.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenants for the period
from June 1, 2021 to September 26,
2021.
 
7.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.

It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 1, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $2,253.71*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January
21, 2022, less the rent deposit
and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$20.02 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 22, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing*
on or before February 1, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 2,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 1, 2022, then starting
February 2, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 2, 2022.
 
8.     If
the Tenants wish to void this order and
continue the tenancy,
the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$3,231.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$3,840.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 1, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not
make full payment in
accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 2, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
