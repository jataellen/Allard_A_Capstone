Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57415-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


26 GREEN
WARBLER CRESCENT ELMIRA ON
  N3B1A6


 




Between:


Greg
  Schmalz


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Craig Birmingham
  Marion Dickie


Tenants



 
 
Greg Schmalz (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Marion Dickie and Craig Birmingham (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on October 28,
2021 with respect to applications SWL-49263-21 and SWL-49264-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants have not met the following
conditions specified in the order: the Tenants
did not pay the lawful
rent for November
on or before November 14, 2021, nor did they pay $1,000.00 on or before
November 30, 2021.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $9,172.00 for rent arrears in Order SWL-49263-21 and
SWL-49264-21 . The amount that is still owing from that order is $9,172.00 and
that amount is included in this order. As a result,
the previous order SWL-49263-21 and SWL-
49264-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from November 14, 2021 to December 13, 2021.




 
6.    
Since the date of the order, the
Landlord incurred charges of $14.00 for cheques tendered by or on behalf of the Tenants
which were returned
NSF and $40.00 for related administration charges.
 
7.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $2,400.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
8.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from March 14, 2000 to January 14, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The previous order SWL-49263-21 and SWL-49264-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 25, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlord $7,664.79*. This amount represents the rent owing up to December 13, 2021 and the
total charges related to NSF cheques tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf
of the Tenants, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$78.90 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting December 14, 2021
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
25, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 25, 2022, then starting January
26, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 26, 2022.
 
 
January 14, 2022

The tenant has until January 24, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion

and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction

Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
