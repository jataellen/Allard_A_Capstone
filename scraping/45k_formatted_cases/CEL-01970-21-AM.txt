File Number: CEL-01970-21-AM
 
 



In the matter
of:


35 HARWOOD DRIVE BARRIE ON L4N7B9


 




Between:


Steven Banning


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Connie Crook
  Dave Crook


Tenants



 
 
This amended
order is issued to correct a clerical error in the original order issued
January 24, 2022, wherein the noted address of the rental unit was incorrect. The change has been marked in bold type
and underlined. The order is
otherwise unamended.
 
Steven Banning (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Connie Crook and Dave
Crook (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 4, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s agent Jessica
Banning, the Landlord’s representative E. Bregu, and the Tenants attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The
Landlord served the Tenant with a
Form N12 seeking
termination of the tenancy for the purpose of residential occupation
by the Landlord and the Landlord’s child.
 
2.    
The termination date in the Form
N12 was July 31, 2021. The Landlord has met the 60 day notice requirement of s.48(2) of the Act, and I am satisfied that the Landlord has met the declaration
requirement of s.72(1)(b) of the Act.
 
3.     The Landlord has also provided the Tenant with a rent
abatement of one month. I am prepared
to accept that a rent credit may satisfy the requirement of one month’s worth
of




 
compensation
under s. 48.1 of the Act, as the rent abatement was for a period of time prior
to the termination date set out in the N12 notice; and it was communicated
prior to the termination date in the notice of termination the Landlord’s
intention to provide a rent abatement in satisfaction of the one month’s
compensation requirement under section 48.1.
 
4.     In order to be successful in this application, the
Landlord must satisfy the Board that at the
time of service of the N12 Notice, he required, in good faith, the rental unit for his own use. In Salter v. Beljinac, 2001 CanLII 40231 (ON SCDC), the court clarified the Landlord’s good faith
requirement as follows:
 
In my view,
s.51(1) charges the finder of fact with the task of determining whether the
landlord’s professed intent to want to reclaim the unit for a family member is
genuine, that is, the notice to terminate the tenancy is made in good faith.
The alternative finding of fact would be that the landlord does not have a
genuine intent to reclaim the unit for the purpose of residential occupation by
a family member.
 
5.     I am satisfied that, on a balance of probabilities,
the Landlord, in good faith, requires possession of the rental unit for the
purpose of residential occupation for himself and his daughter.
 
6.     The Landlord did not attend the hearing, but submitted
documentation requesting that his power of attorney and daughter, Jessica
Banning (JB) testify on his behalf, due to a disability impacting his thoughts
and speech. JB testified that she
intends to live at the rental unit with her father. JB also testified that she is familiar with the rental unit, as
it was her family home growing up, before moving to Toronto.
 
7.     JB has a 3-year-old son and has recently moved back to
Barrie to help care for her father,
given his medical issues. Since July
1, 2021, the Landlord and JB have resided down the street from the rental unit
at 41 Harwood drive (“41 Harwood”), but advised that
41 Harwood
property is not a long-term housing solution since it is owned by the
Landlord’s mother-in-law and is in need of significant renovations.
 
8.     The current rent for the rental unit is $2000.00. The
Tenants challenged the Landlord’s professed intent with the Tenant Dave Crook (“DC”)
testifying that the Form
N12 was only served as a way to evict the Tenants due to a
deteriorating tenancy relationship and a desire to secure a higher rent for the
property. DC testified that following
receipt of the Form N12 on May 27, 2021, the Tenants commenced moving some of
their items into storage and selling other items, in preparation for a move. However, DC testified that on August 27,
2021 he was verbally advised by the Landlord Steven Banning that the Form N12
was “a good way to evict” and that “You guys are not going anywhere. Move your stuff back.”  JB denies any bad faith, or ulterior
motive as alleged.
 
9.     I find JB’s evidence more believable since her
professed intent is supported by her actions to date, as she has already taken
steps to relocate to the Barrie area and she is currently living with her
father down the street from the rental property at 41 Harwood. The property at 41 Harwood
is not owed by JB or the Landlord, and I find it believable




 
that the Landlord and JB
would seek to relocate to a property
that the Landlord’ does own and for which, they have familiarity.
 
10.  Section 83 requires that the Board consider all the
circumstances in the case, including the Tenants’ and the Landlord’s situations, to determine if it would be appropriate to delay or deny eviction
in the form of section 83 relief. The Tenants have two teenagers. Since
there is no immediate identified urgency on the part of the Landlord and given
the challenges identified by the Tenants in finding other housing in the
current climate, I believe it to be fair and appropriate to delay the eviction
in order to give the Tenants additional time to find other accommodations. I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances of the Tenants
and Landlord in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act and find that it would not be unfair
to postpone the eviction until March 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated, as of
March 31, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 31, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 31, 2022, then starting
April 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after April 1, 2022.
