In the matter
of:


617, 226 REBECCA STREET HAMILTON ON L8R1C3


 




Between:


Cityhousing Hamilton Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Carlos Ruscitti


Tenant



 
 
 
Cityhousing Hamilton
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Carlos Ruscitti (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 15, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Katherine Howlett, attended the hearing.
As of 11:36 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from August 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective October 4, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of February
28, 2022, the monthly rent for the unit increased
to $539.00
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant paid $3,127.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from
eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $126.00,
which represents the amount of rent owing up to February 28, 2022.




File Number: SOL-25645-21
 
2.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before March 15, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 16,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
