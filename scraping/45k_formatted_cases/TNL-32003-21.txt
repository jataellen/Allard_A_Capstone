In the matter
of:


1, 22 LEDUC STREET ETOBICOKE ON M9W2A7


 




Between:


Zeke
  Hohenberger


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Paulette Ferguson


Tenant



 
 
Zeke Hohenberger (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Paulette Ferguson (the
'Tenant') because the Landlord has entered into an agreement of purchase and sale of the rental
unit and the purchaser’s parents
require possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation.
 
This hearing was held by videoconference on January 6, 2022. The Landlord,
and the Landlord’s representative, Brad Chudyk, attended the hearing. The Tenant was also present at the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     On March 29, 2021, the Landlord served the Tenant with
an N12 Notice of Termination (N12) with a termination date of
May 31, 2021. The N12 seeks termination of the tenancy on the ground that the Landlord
entered into an Agreement of Purchase and Sale of the rental unit with
purchasers Tenzing Kundol and Kinga Tsering Gaeshingtsong who require
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation for
Tsering Gaeshingtsong’s parents – Pema Lhamo and Norbu Gaeshingtsong.
 
Background
 
2.    
A previous hearing for this
application was held by videoconference on August 19, 2021. During that hearing
the Landlord submitted a signed declaration from the purchasers, dated June 8,
2021, that the purchasers require the residence at 1, 22 Leduc Street in
Etobicoke for their own use. However,
the N12 listed the purchaser’s parents, Pema Lhamo and Norbu Gaeshingtsong, as the individuals requiring the rental
unit for their
own use. At the time of the
hearing, the Landlord was unable to provide an affidavit or declaration sworn
by the purchaser’s parents that they require use of the rental unit as
stipulated by section 72(1)(b) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
“Act”).
 
3.     On September 13, 2021 the Board ordered
that the Landlord,
on or before September 30, 2021, shall file an affidavit or
declaration with the Board, signed by the purchaser’s parents, indicating their
intent to occupy the rental unit for their own personal use.




 
4.    
The Landlord filed the purchaser’s
parent’s affidavit with the Board on September 22, 2021, and the hearing
was reconvened on January 6, 2022 for the purpose
of allowing the Tenant to
raise any concerns with the affidavit.
 
Good faith
 
5.     The N12 was served pursuant to section 49 of the Act. Section 49(1) requires that, in order to
be successful in this application, the Landlord must establish that at the time
of the service of the N12 notice, the purchaser required,
in good faith, the unit for residential use.
 
6.     In Feeney v. Noble, 1994 CanLII 10538 (ON SC),
the Court held that the test of good faith is genuine intention to occupy the
premises and not the reasonableness of the Landlord’s proposal. This principle
was upheld in Salter v. Beljinac 2001
CanLII 40231 (ON SCDC), where
the Court held that the “good faith” requirement simply means that the Landlord
sincerely intends to occupy the rental unit. The Landlord may also have
additional motives for selecting a particular rental
unit, but this does not affect the good
faith of the Landlord’s notice.”
 
7.     In the more recent case of Fava v. Harrison,
[2014] O.J No. 2678 ONSC 3352 (Ont.Div.Ct.) the Court determined that while the
motives of the Landlord are, per Salter, “largely irrelevant”, the Board can
consider the conduct and motives of the Landlord to draw inferences as to whether the Landlord desires,
in good faith to occupy the property.”
 
8.     The Landlord testified, and also provided a signed affidavit from the purchaser’s parents, dated September 22, 2021, that the purchaser’s parents
require unit 1 (Main Floor), 22 Leduc Street in Etobicoke for their own use. The Landlord also submitted a signed
declaration from the purchasers, dated August 20, 2021, that the purchaser requires
vacant possession of the rental unit for the residential occupation of his
parents.
 
9.     The Landlord testified
further that he did not serve any previous N12 or N13 Notices of Termination regarding this tenancy.
 
10.  The Landlord also provided an Agreement of Purchase and Sale,
dated March 23, 2021, with a June
30, 2021 completion date for the transfer of property ownership. The Landlord testified that the completion
date of the transaction continues to be postponed pending the termination of
the Tenant’s tenancy, and that the current completion date is February 28,
2022.
 
11.  The Tenant testified
that she believes
the purchaser’s parents
will not reside in the unit,
noting that the upstairs unit in
the residential complex has been renovated, but remains vacant. The Tenant stated that she believes her
unit on the main floor will also be left vacant.
 
12.  The Tenant questioned the purchase and sale closing
date of October 1, 2021 listed in the purchaser’s parent’s
affidavit. The Landlord
responded that October
1, 2021 was the
closing date of the purchase and sale of the property when the purchaser’s
parents signed the affidavit on September 22, 2021. The Tenant had no further questions or issues regarding the
purchaser’s parent’s affidavit.




 
13.  On the basis of the evidence provided, I am satisfied
that the purchaser’s parents genuinely intend to use the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. I find that the purchasers in good faith require
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
Compensation
 
14.  Section 49.1
of the Act requires a landlord
to compensate a tenant in an amount
equal to one month’s rent if
the purchaser of the property,
in good faith, requires the rental unit for
the purpose of residential occupation. Section 55.1 of the Act requires this compensation
to be paid no later than on the termination date specified in the notice of
termination of the tenancy. In addition,
subsection 83(4) of the Act provides that no eviction order shall be issued in
a proceeding regarding a termination of a tenancy for the purpose of
residential occupation unless the landlord has complied with section 49.1 of
the Act.
 
15.  The Landlord testified that one month’s rent
compensation in the amount of $1500.00 was provided to the Tenant
at the end of April
2021 via cheque.
He remarked that this
amount exceeded the monthly rent of $1050.00.
The Tenant confirmed receipt of this cheque; however, she noted that she
did not cash the cheque.
 
16.  I am satisfied that by providing the $1500.00 cheque
to the Tenant before the N12 date of
termination of May 31, 2021, the Landlord met his obligation to pay the Tenant
compensation equal to one month’s rent in accordance with section 49.1 of the
Act.
 
Relief from Eviction
 
17.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the ‘Act’) and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until February 28, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
18.  The Tenant testified that she is a single mom without
steady income as a result of her position as an unscheduled relief worker for
Canada Post. She further noted that
she is actively looking for alternate rental units, but the rents are higher
than what she can afford. The Tenant
testified further that her current rental unit is within walking distance of her daughter’s day care, and her son’s high school.
A new rental unit not in her current
neighbourhood would be devastating for her family.
 
19.  I find that, although the purchasers in good faith
require possession of the rental unit for the
purpose of residential occupation, postponing the Tenant’s eviction
until February 28, 2022 will provide the Tenant with
more time to secure a rental unit that satisfies her family’s requirements and budgetary constraints. I find that this postponement would not be unfair to the Landlord or the
purchasers who have an Agreement of Purchase and Sale completion date for the
rental unit of February 28, 2022.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated as of February
28, 2022. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 28, 2022.




 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 28, 2022, then starting
March 1, 2022 the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 1, 2022.
