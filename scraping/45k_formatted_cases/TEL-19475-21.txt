Order under Section
77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19475-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


4, 39 WEST
STREET EAST TRENTON ON
  K8V2L7


 




Between:


Hammad Arif


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Christina Bird


Tenant



 
 
 
Hammad Arif (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Christina Bird (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant entered into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
The application was sent to a hearing
in order to have greater
clarity about the conditions listed on the N11 agreement to terminate.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 8, 2021.
 
The Landlord
and the Tenant attended the hearing. The Tenant spoke
to Tenant Duty Counsel
prior to the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant said that she signed an agreement to terminate the tenancy as of October
7, 2021 and she did not move out of the rental unit by the termination
date set out in the agreement.
 
2.    
The Landlord
requests an order
for eviction. He said that,
on September 19, 2021, the Tenant confirmed with him that she was
going to vacate the rental unit as agreed. He
said that the Tenant has effectively moved out of the rental unit, and there are none of her
belongings left in the unit. He said
that she has not paid any rent for at least two months, and there are now drug
dealers living in her rental unit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
said that she does reside
in the rental unit, but she sometimes stays with her boyfriend. She admits that she has not paid any rent for two months because
she was “advised” to hold back rent until maintenance issues are dealt with.

4.    
The Tenant
said that her income is $1,600.00 per month on ODSP, and she has not been able to find an alternative place to
live. She said that she needs more
time to move because she would have nowhere to go if she were evicted.
 
5.    
The Landlord
submits that he visits the rental unit all the time, and the
Tenant is not living there. He said that he would be willing to extend
the time if she were living there, however, the residential complex is now
unsafe because of drug dealers.
 
6.    
I find that the Tenant
admits that she voluntarily signed an agreement to terminate, and she did not
move out when she had agreed. She
voluntarily signed the agreement to terminate,
and confirmed that she was going to leave. There is no evidence that she was coerced to agree.
 
7.    
I find that the
Landlord is entitled to an eviction order based on the agreement to terminate the tenancy. The Tenant has said that she has frequently stayed
with her boyfriend, and
therefore she has somewhere to go on at least a temporary basis.
 
8.    
Having considered all
the circumstances, and the Tenant’s inability to find somewhere else to live
within her budget, I find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction
a few weeks in order to permit the Tenant more time to find an alternative accommodation.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 31, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022, then starting
February1, 2022, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 1, 2022.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction

Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
