Between:

Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Fanny

Marlon Keith Marshall


Tenants



 
 
Ravinder
Khurana and Lakhwinder Dhillon (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Fanny Gauvin and Marlon Keith Marshall (the 'Tenants')
because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued
by the Board on October
7, 2021 with respect
to application TNL-32796-21.
 
The Landlords' application was resolved by order
TNL-35500-21, issued on November 30-, 2021. The Tenants filed a motion to set
aside order TNL-35500-21.
 
This motion
was heard by video conference on February 7, 2022. The Landlord, Ravinder
Khurana, the Landlord's Legal Representative, A. Friel and the Tenant, Marlon Keith Marshall attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     Order TNL-32796-21 provided that the Landlords could
apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain conditions specified in the order.
 
2.     The Landlords filed the application under section 78
of the Act, alleging that the Tenants failed
to pay the monthly rent for October
2021, on October
1, 2021, contrary to the order. This resulted in ex parte eviction
order TNL-35500-21 terminating the tenancy.
 
3.    
In support of the motion to set aside the order, the Tenant
testified that in compliance with order TNL-32796-21,
he paid to the Landlords the monthly rent on August 5, 2021 for the month of August
2021; September 2021 rent on August 29, 2021; and October 2021 rent
on September
30, 2021.
 
4.     These payments were not disputed by the Landlords who
stated that the payment made by the Tenant
on August 5, 2021 was for the month of July 2021 and that the Tenants
have




File Number: TNL-35500-21-SA
 
paid the rent one month late each month.
The Landlords argued
that the Tenants
paid the rent for October
2021 on October 31, 2021.
 
5.     A review of order TNL-32796-21 shows that the Tenants
were ordered to pay the rent for the month of August 2021 on or before August
5, 2021 and the rent from September 2021 to August 2022,
on the first day of each month. The rent for July 2021 was not considered in the order.
 
6.     Based on all the evidence, the Tenants complied with
the order despite the Landlords’ claim. While the Landlords may have been
unaware that July 2021 rent was outstanding during the hearing on August 5,
2021, the Landlords did not seek a review of order TNL- 32796-21 once that
information became known. As a result, I can only consider the conditions as stipulated in the order and I find that the Tenants
paid the rent for
the month of August 2021 on
August 5, 2021, in compliance with the order and for the month of October 2021,
the payment was made on September 30, 2021.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The motion to set aside order TNL-35500-21, issued on
November 30, 2021, is granted. The order cannot be enforced by the Landlord.
 
2.     The order issued by the Board on October 7, 2021 with respect to application TNL-32796- 21 continues in effect.
