Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: SOL-24888-21



In the matter
of:


1918, 155 PARK
STREET S HAMILTON ON L8P3E7


 




Between:


City Housing Hamilton Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Andre Dion


Tenant



 
 
City Housing
Hamilton Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Andre
Dion (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on January 11,
2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Katherine MacIntyre, attended the hearing. As of 3:09 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the
Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
April 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective April 30, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
As of January 1, 2022, the monthly rent for the unit is
$767.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
is not holding a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.    
The Tenant
paid $1,402.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 28, 2022.




File Number: SOL-24888-21
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$5,897.14*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
17, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $25.22
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 18, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 29, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 28, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $5,869.00** to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would
not be terminated and the Tenant could
remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
29, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
