Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-53490-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


123
  GAY CRESCENT KITCHENER ON N2A2C2


 




Between:


Debbie Gerber


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Dariana Nieto Estiviz Estepan Jose Nieto
Juan Carlos Nieto Martin Estrada


Tenants



 
 
 
Debbie Gerber
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Estiviz Estepan, Martin Estrada,
Dariana Nieto, Jose Nieto and Juan Carlos
Nieto (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for
the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord has also applied for an
order requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the damage.
 
This
application was heard via videoconference on January 24, 2022. The Landlord,
the Tenants,
D. Nieto and Jose Nieto, and the
Tenants’ legal representative, Y. Asaad, attended the hearing. The Landlord was
being assisted by legal counsel, E. Anani.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     At the hearing,
the Landlord requested the consent of the Board to withdraw
her application without prejudice. The Tenants had vacated
the unit and the only live issue was damages pursuant to section 89 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).
 
2.     The Tenants submitted that the matter should be
withdrawn with prejudice. The Landlord was seeking to withdraw after it was
explained that I could only rely on her viva voce evidence. The Landlord
failed to serve on the Tenants the evidence she intended to rely on at the
hearing in accordance with the Board’s Rules. The Tenants submitted that the
withdrawal should be made with prejudice because the Tenants’ legal
representative contacted the Landlord in advance of the hearing to receive
evidence, but she declined. Further, the Tenants took off work and incurred
costs to attend the hearing.

3.    
The Landlord submitted that she is a lay person and did not understand the procedure. It would be prejudicial to the Landlord to
deny her ability to file against the Tenants for the damage to the unit.
 
4.     I am satisfied
that the Landlord did not understand the Board’s Rules. As such, I do not
find that the Landlord’s request to withdraw constitutes an abuse of process and so the withdrawal of the
application will be on a without prejudice basis.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord's application is withdrawn without prejudice.
