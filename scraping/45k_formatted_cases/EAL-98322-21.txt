Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-98322-21



In the
  matter of:


B,
  225 LOUISA STREET CORNWALL ON K6H4P9


 




Between:


2482601 Ontario Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jeramy Thompson Tanis Laframboise Warren Skye


Tenants



 
 
2482601 Ontario Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Warren Skye, Jeramy Thompson
and Tanis Laframboise (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 1, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s Agent, Kathy Gingrass, the Landlord's Legal Representative, Lorrie
McCullough, and the Tenants, Tanis Laframboise and Warren Skye, attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October 24, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent as of January 1, 2022 is
$1,062.60.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     
The Tenants paid $550.00
after the application was filed.
 
6.     
The Tenants testified that they have reached out to a community agency
to support them in
paying off a large portion
of the arrears and they have started
to get OW in November. The
Tenants also indicated that they have an 8 month old at home and they are also currently
pregnant and would suffer great prejudice if they are evicted. The Tenants
requested an extension to at least February 28th for the arrears.
 
7.     
The Landlord was not opposed to the extension of February 28th.




 
8.     
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 28, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b)
of the Act.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenants void the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.
 
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $5,298.29*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 16, 2022.
 
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$34.52 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 17, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
28, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
8.     
If, on or before February 28,
2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $5,961.20** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     
The Tenants may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that
subsection on or after March 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once
during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
