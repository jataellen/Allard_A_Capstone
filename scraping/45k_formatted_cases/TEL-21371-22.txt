Between:

Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Aaron Gignac
  Brooke Field


Tenants



 
 
 
and Brittany
Labombard and James Labombard (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Aaron Gignac
and Brooke Field
(the 'Tenants') and for an order
to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a
condition specified in the order issued by the Board on October 8, 2021 with
respect to application SWL- 48703-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlords could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants
have not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The
Tenants did not pay $1500.00 rent on or before December 15, 2021. The Tenants
did not pay $500.00 arrears on or before January 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the
Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlords are entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $7,186.00 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
SWL-48703-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $4,686.00 and that amount
is included in this order.
As a result, the previous order SWL-48703-21 is cancelled.




 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenants
have failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from December 15, 2021 to February 14, 2022.
 
6.    
The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,500.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from July 30, 2019 to
February 2, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SWL-48703-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 13, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $4,338.40*.
This amount represents the rent owing up to February 2, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the previous
application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the rent
deposit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $49.32 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 3, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before February
13, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 14, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 13, 2022, then starting
February 14, 2022, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlords on or after February 14, 2022.
 
 
February 2, 2022

The tenant has until February 12, 2022
to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by February 12, 2022 the order will be stayed and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on August 14, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
