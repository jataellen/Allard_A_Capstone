Review Order
 
Niagara Regional Housing (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Nathan Alligood (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved
by order SOL-15504-20 issued on October
26, 2021.
 
On November 15, 2021, the Tenant requested
a review of the order and that the order be stayed until the request to review the
order is resolved.
 
On November 16, 2021 interim order SOL-15504-20-RV-IN was issued, staying
the order issued on October 26, 2021.
 
The request was heard by videoconference on January 31, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s representative D. Rose (DR),
the Landlord’s legal representative J. Callender, and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant’s request
for a review is based on the ground of being not reasonably able to
participate in the proceedings.
 
2.     The hearing that gave rise to the order under
review was held on October
19, 2021. The Tenant did not attend.
 
3.     At the review hearing, the Tenant testified that he
did not know about the hearing in October. He testified that he attended “the other
one.” This matter
had been scheduled to be heard
in December 2020 and was adjourned at the Tenant’s
request. It was adjourned
to May 25, 2021; that hearing was adjourned by the adjudicator due to a scheduling error.




 
4.    
The Tenant testified that he cannot read or write but that his roommate can read. He also
testified that he does not check his mail because no one sends him anything.
 
5.     DR is an employee of the Landlord.
At the review hearing DR testified that she placed the
notice of hearing (for the hearing held in October 2019) in the Tenant’s
mailbox on August 30, 2021. The
Landlord filed a certificate of service (COS) signed by the Landlord’s
representative, stating that she placed the notice of hearing in the Tenant’s
mailbox or a place where mail is normally delivered on August 30, 2021. The COS
was signed on August 30, 2021.
 
6.     Based on the Landlord’s representative’s uncontested testimony, which
was supported by a contemporaneously produced COS, I find, on a balance
of probabilities, that DR put
the notice of hearing in the Tenant’s mailbox on August 30, 2021.
 
7.    
The notice was in the Tenant’s
mailbox more than six weeks prior to the hearing.
Even if the Tenant only
checks his mail once a month, he would have found the notice in his mailbox. It
is unreasonable not to ever check one’s mail. Mail is a form of service under
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) and is the method by
which the Board delivers documents and notices to parties who have not provided
an email address. A person cannot render themselves immune to Board proceedings
by not providing an email address and not checking their mail.
 
8.     I note that the Tenant
did not provide
any disability-related reason
for why he does not check his mail.
 
9.    
Based on the above I find that the
Tenant was reasonably able to participate in the proceedings. He would have known about the hearing
if he had checked his mail even as
infrequently as once per month.
 
10.  The Landlord’s legal
representative advised that the Sheriff
was scheduled to enforce a different eviction order against the
Tenant the day after the review hearing. It therefore makes no sense to delay
the lifting of the stay for this matter.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The request to review order
SOL-15504-20 issued on October 26, 2021 is denied. The order is confirmed and remains
unchanged.
 
2.     The interim order issued on November 16, 2021 is cancelled. The stay of order SOL- 15504-20 is lifted.
