Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57755-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


414, 80 MOOREGATE CRESCENT KITCHENER ON N2M5G1


 




Between:


Hazelview Property Services Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Abpas Younef Baktash Enaiatullah


Tenants



 
 
 
Hazelview Property Services Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Baktash Enaiatullah and Abpas Younef (the 'Tenants') and for an order
to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe
because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the
Board on August 19, 2021 with respect to application SWL-51402-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants
have not met the following
condition specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $1000.00 arrears
on or before February 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $7,466.52 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
SWL-51402-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $5,466.52
and that amount is included
in this order. As a result,
the previous order
SWL-51402-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from September 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,204.94 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
1, 2022 to February 28, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SWL-51402-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before March 11, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$6,688.42*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to February 28, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$39.89 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting March 1, 2022 to
the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before March 11, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 12,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 11, 2022, then starting March 12, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 12, 2022.
