Viollanda Karafil Zef Grishaj


Tenants




 
 
 
Williams & McDaniel Property
Management (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Viollanda Karafil
and Zef Grishaj (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe. The Landlord also claimed administration charges related to
NSF cheques.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 20, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, John Andersen, attended the hearing. As of 2:55 p.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the
Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the
period from September 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October 06, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     
As of January 1, 2022, the monthly rent for the unit is $1,588.84.
 
4.     
The Tenants have made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.     
The Landlord incurred charges
of $100.00 for administration charges
related to cheques tendered by
or on behalf of the Tenants, which were returned NSF.
 
6.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,570.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlord.




File Number: SWL-55570-21
 
7.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from March 3, 2020
to January 1, 2022.
 
8.      I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord
attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant
and find that it
would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 11, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$6,427.87*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 31, 2022 and the total charges related to
NSF cheques tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenants, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $52.24
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 1, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
11, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 12, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 11, 2022, then starting February
12, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 12, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)     $8,154.84 if the payment is made on or before
January 31, 2022,
or
ii)     $9,743.68 if the payment is made on or before
February 11, 2022**.
If the Tenants
do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 12, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The




File Number: SWL-55570-21
 
Tenants are only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
