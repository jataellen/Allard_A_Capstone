In the matter
of:


DOOR 4, 453 MONTAGUE AVENUE SUDBURY ON P3C4G6


 




Between:


William Richer


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Douglas Junkala


Tenant



 
 
 
William Richer
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Douglas Junkala (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
wilfully caused undue damage to the premises, used the rental unit or the
residential complex in a manner that is inconsistent with use as a residential
premises and that has caused or can be expected to cause significant damage, and
because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex has seriously impaired the safety of any
person.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 7, 2022.
 
The Landlord, William
Richer attended the hearing. As of
4:00 p.m., the Tenant was not present nor represented although served properly
with a Notice of Hearing by the Board.
 
At the
hearing, I raised a preliminary issue with respect to the N7 Notice of
Termination (‘the Notice’) and the Certificate of Service. The Landlord was advised by the Member
that the Notice filed with the Board was blank and a Certificate of Service had
not been filed with the Board within
five days of the filing of the application.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
The Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the “Act”) and the Board’s Rules of Practice (the “Rules”) set
out at Rule 4.2: where the LTB permits an application to be e-filed,
any related Notice of Termination and Certificate of Service must be uploaded
at the time of filing using the LTB's
e-filing portal and Rule 4.3 states: If the Notice of Termination and
Certificate of Service cannot be uploaded at the same time as the application
is e-filed, they must be emailed to the Regional Office responsible for the
application within 5 calendar days of the e-filing. Failure to upload or to
email these documents in time may result in administrative dismissal of the
application.




File Number: NOL-44371-21
 
2.   
The Notice was blank,
and the Certificate of Service was not filed
pursuant to the Rules
therefore the application must be dismissed.
 
3.    The Landlord requested
the consent of the Board to withdraw
their application.
 
4.    In accordance with subsection 200(4) of the Act, I consent to the withdrawal of the application.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord's application is dismissed without
prejudice.
