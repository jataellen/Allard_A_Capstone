In the matter
of:


5, 156 DUNLOP
STREET W BARRIE ON L4N1B2


 




Between:


A.G.Secure Property Management Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Bruce Crocker Sarah
Graham


Tenants



 
 
 
A.G.Secure Property Management Inc (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Sarah Graham and Bruce Crocker
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 17, 2022. The Landlord, Landlord’s Legal Representative, Nicole Fazzari, and the Tenant, Bruce Crocker, attended
the hearing. The Tenant met
with Tenant Duty Counsel and obtained summary legal information prior to the
commencement of the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from February 1, 2021 to July 31,
2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective February 28, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,062.60.
 
4.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,062.60
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
has been paid up to December 31, 2021.
 
6.    
The Tenants paid $9,424.00
after the application was filed.
 
7.     It is uncontested the total rent arrears owing to January
31, 2022 is $2,537.60.




 
8.    
The Tenant stated he has resided
in the rental unit for 3 years;
the other Tenant
is his girlfriend. Both
Tenants receive ODSP benefits totalling between $1,800.00 and
$1,900.00 per month. He said they had been receiving a subsidy for their rent and were unaware it was discontinued; this
led to the rent arrears.
 
9.     The Tenant requested the Board impose a repayment plan
which will preserve the tenancy and allow then to gradually pay the arrears
owing. While speaking
with Tenant Duty Counsel he
was provided with information regarding financial assistance with his arrears,
which he said he would investigate. He originally said the Tenants could pay
$100.00 per month towards the
amount owing until paid in full but later offered to increase that amount to $400.00 per month. He said he would prefer
to cut back on other expenses than become homeless.
 
10.  The Landlord was opposed to a repayment
plan asserting $100.00
per month would take
in excess of 27 months to pay in full which would be prejudicial to the
Landlord and
$400.00 per month, based on the
Tenants’ income, unlikely to be met. Further, the Landlord noted
information regarding financial assistance with the arrears had been
presented to the Tenants when the N4 was served and again months later.
 
11.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including the Tenants’ personal and financial
circumstances and weighed this against any potential prejudice to the Landlord
and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$2,723.60, which represents the arrears of rent
($2,537.60), and costs ($186.00) outstanding for the period ending January 31,
2022.
 
2.     The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenants
is denied on the condition
that:
 
(a)  
The Tenants shall make the following payments to the Landlord in respect of the monies owing under paragraph 1 of
this order:

(b)  
The Tenants shall also pay the
Landlord the rent for the months of February 2022 to November 2022 in full,
and on the first of each corresponding month.
 
3.     If the Tenants
fail to make any of the payments
in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates required, then:
 
(a)        
The Landlord may apply under
section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an
order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants, and for the payment of
any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not already ordered under paragraph 1
of this order. The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a breach
of a condition set out in paragraph 2 of this order.
 
(b)        
The balance owing under paragraph 1 of this order shall become payable
on the day following the date
of default. The monies owing shall bear interest at the post-judgment interest
rate determined under subsection 207(7) of the Act.
