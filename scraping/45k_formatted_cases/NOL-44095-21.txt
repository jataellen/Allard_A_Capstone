Poli Fiberglass Industries
Thunder Bay (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Norma Lawson (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard by videoconference on January 13, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Rob Livingston, attended
the hearing. As of 3 p.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not
paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
20, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
November 30, 2021. The Tenant
was in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,092.52.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,171.23 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from September 21, 2021 to September 20, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
It is
ordered that:




File Number: NOL-44095-21
 
1.    
The tenancy is terminated as of November
30, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$3,167.54*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to November 30, 2021, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
31, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
