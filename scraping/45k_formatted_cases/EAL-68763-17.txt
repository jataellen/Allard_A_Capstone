D.R.I.T.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict L.M.
and J.L.L. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe and have been persistently late in paying the rent.
 
This
application was heard in Ottawa on December 12, 2017.
 
Only
the Landlord’s representative, L.M., attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
THE
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from September 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 27, 2017.
2.      The
Tenants paid $350.00 after the application was filed.
3.      The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending December 31, 2017 total $2,550.00.
4.      The
Landlord incurred costs of $190.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
5.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $850.00 from the Tenants and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
6.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from May 8, 2017 to
September 27, 2017 totalling $4.99.
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Landlord is unaware of any circumstances that
would justify refusing or delaying eviction.
THE
APPLICATION FOR PERSISTENT LATE PAYMENT
8.      At
the hearing, the Landlord requested the consent of the Board to withdraw the
application alleging persistent late payment of rent.
9.      In
accordance with subsection 200(4) of the Act, I consent to the withdrawal of
the application.
It is
ordered that:
THE
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.      Unless
the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before January 2, 2018.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $1,397.33*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to December 20, 2017, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $27.95 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting December 21, 2017 to the date they move out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
December 31, 2017, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from January 1, 2018 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before January 2, 2018, then starting January 3,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 3,
2018.
8.      If
the Tenants wish to void this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $2,740.00 if the payment is made on or before December 31, 2017, or
ii)       $3,590.00 if the payment is made on or before January 2, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after January 3, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
THE
APPLICATION FOR PERSISTENT LATE PAYMENT
10.   The
Landlord’s application is dismissed.
