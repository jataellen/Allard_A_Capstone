Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-17145-18
CR (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict KW(‘KW’ or the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Waterloo on July 18,
2018.  The Landlord attended the hearing.  The Tenant attended the hearing and
spoke with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Preliminary Issue:  Adjournment
Request Denied
 
1.    This matter was called around 3:00 p.m. as one of the last matters
of the hearing block.  KW requested an adjournment, stating he was 82 years old
and was too tired to stay for the hearing.  KW then said the hearing would be
very complex as he was not even a tenant and there were ongoing court
applications with respect to the property.  KW indicated he had spoken to Duty
Counsel prior to the hearing.   
2.    In my opening remarks, I had asked anyone with a special need that
required accommodation to let me know, so that we could determine the appropriate
accommodation.  KW did not approach me at any time prior to the hearing to
request an adjournment or to advise me of any special needs.  KW was in the
hearing room for most of the day, and appeared to observe the other matters
with interest.  
3.    The Landlord offered to buy KW a snack at the concession stand, and
so I opted to take a recess in order for KW to get something to eat.  When the
matter was recalled, KW advised he had refused to eat anything, and asked if I
could “force him” to stay for the hearing.  I said no, but told KW that if he
chose to leave, the matter would proceed in his absence, as I was denying his
adjournment request since the Board had set aside this time for the hearing. 
KW chose to participate in the hearing.  
4.    At several points during the hearing, KW stated he wanted the
hearing to be over, but immediately after making these statements, proceeded to
make spirited assertions about the jurisdiction of the Board, the competency of
this Member, and the facts surrounding the tenancy.  Even after I advised the
parties that I had all the information I needed to make my decision, KW
continued making his assertions until I ended the hearing. 
Determinations:
 
Is KW a Tenant?
1.    The rental unit is a single detached home.  It is a bungalow with a
basement apartment, but the basement apartment is not separately rented; KW has
access to all parts of the home.  
Ownership of the
Rental Unit 
2.   
In the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (‘the Act’), the
definition of ‘tenant’ in section 2(1) includes a person who pays rent in
return for the right to occupy a rental unit, but does not include a person
who has the right to occupy a rental unit by virtue of being a co-owner of the
property.
3.    KW testified that he used to own the rental unit.  In the early
1990s, a friend of his (‘D’) purchased the home from him, as KW was in
significant financial trouble.  KW testified that he had a verbal agreement
with D that he could live for the rest of his life in the house after she purchased
it.  D eventually sold the property to the Landlord.  KW testified that the
Landlord was aware of this “living tenancy” when the Landlord bought the
property, and that the Landlord purchased the property at a reduced rate
because of this condition.  
4.    KW asserted he is pursuing the matter of his interest in the
property in superior court, although he submitted no documents to that effect. 
KW submitted an unsigned letter from his lawyer as Exhibit # 2 which sets out
what KW has told the lawyer:  that KW retains a “life interest” in the
property, namely use of a portion of the property for his lifetime, and that
the property was the subject of a court case between KW and D in which this
“life interest” was confirmed.  No other paperwork or court documents were submitted
by KW to support the claims in this letter.
5.    According to documents submitted by the Landlord as Exhibit # 3, in
the early 1990s, KW was experiencing financial difficulties and the bank took
possession of the property.  D purchased the home from the bank and entered
into a rent-to-own arrangement with KW.  Unfortunately, KW was not able to keep
up with his part of this arrangement and fell into arrears of rent.  D applied
for and was granted termination of the “tenancy” in Court File 166/93 in a judgement
was issued on June 9, 1993, in which KW is listed as the “Respondent Tenant”.  D
never enforced the eviction order, and KW has lived in the rental unit ever
since.
6.    The Landlord bought the property from D in 2014.  The Landlord
denied KW’s claim that he purchased the property for a reduced rate because of
KW’s “living tenancy”; however the Landlord acknowledged that he was aware that
KW lived in the rental unit at the time he purchased the property.  
7.    Included in the Landlord’s Exhibit # 3 is a land registry document
which shows the Landlord and his spouse on the title of the property beginning
in March 2014.  Prior to that, D and The Royal Bank of Canada were on title. 
KW’s name is not on the land registry document.  
8.   
KW agreed that he is not on title as an owner or
co-owner of the rental unit.  KW referred several times to a Superior court
case in which his equitable ownership in the property either has been
established or is being established.  No orders or judgements were submitted
into evidence, and KW was unclear as to the status of that claim, although KW
was unshaken in his belief that the Superior Court issue must be resolved
first, prior to any Board involvement.  
9.   
In Warraich v.
Choudhry, 2018 ONSC 1267, the Courts clarified that
the Board cannot determine equitable ownership as this
falls exclusively within the Superior Court’s jurisdiction.  To determine if
someone is a “co-owner,” the Board may only consider whether that person has legal
ownership.  The Courts also set out that there is no basis for indefinitely
deferring a Board proceeding merely because an equitable claim is being pursued
at the Superior Court.  In Warraich, the Court found that the Board had
jurisdiction to hear the L1 application before it despite the fact that the
property was subject to a dispute in Superior Court, and that there was no
error in the Board proceeding before the dispute was resolved at Superior
Court.  Warraich is binding upon me. 
10.
In this case, based on the testimony and
documents before me, I find that KW is not an “owner” or a “co-owner” of the
property as that term of the Act was defined by the Court in Warraich
because he is not on title as a legal owner.  KW is free to pursue his
equitable claim in Superior Court but such a proceeding does not affect this
Board’s exclusive jurisdiction over residential landlord-tenant disputes. 
Payment of Rent
11.
As I have found that KW is neither an owner nor a
co-owner of the rental unit, I must now decide if KW meets the rest of the
definition of ‘tenant’ under section 2(1) of the Act,
specifically if KW is a person who pays rent in return for the right
to occupy a rental unit.  
12.
In this case, all parties
testified that KW made monthly payments to the current Landlord of $500.00 in
order to live in the rental unit.  KW referred to these payments as “an honorarium”, and asserted that he plans to build an addition on
the rental unit where he will live out the rest of his days.  The Landlord testified
that he collected KW’s monthly $500 payment from 2014 until KW stopped paying
in December 2017.  
13.
I find that these payments meet the definition
of rent in the Act, as the Landlord collected these payments in exchange for
allowing KW to live in the rental unit.  
14.
In addition, I note the Superior Court judgement
made in 1993 (Court File 166/93), in which KW was found to be a tenant.  I have
no evidence of any other court decision that overturns that finding.  
15.
Therefore, I find that KW is a tenant under
the Act and that the “honorarium” the Tenant was paying is considered “rent” as
that term is defined in the Act.
Does the Act Apply?
16.
This is a rather unique tenancy situation.  The
Landlord and the Tenant lived together for approximately four years, sharing a
kitchen and bathroom, until the Landlord moved into a new principle residence
in the winter of 2017.  Subsection 5(i) of the Act exempts living accommodations
in which the occupant is required to share a bathroom or kitchen facility with
the owner.  In this case, the rental unit was exempt from the Act from the
commencement of this tenancy in 2014.  
17.
In Cowie v. Bindlish, 2010 ONSC 2628
(CanLII), the Courts set out that the Board must have regard to the living
circumstances at the commencement of the tenancy, and neither party can
unilaterally change the terms of the tenancy.  One might interpret that to mean
since the Act did not apply to this tenancy when it began in 2014, the Act can
never apply to this tenancy, even after the conditions that exempted the accommodations
from the Act (the sharing of facilities) ceased to exist.  
18.
However, a careful reading of Cowie
reveals that the intent behind the Court’s decision was to prevent parties from
making unilateral decisions that would cause the Act to cease to apply. 
The decision references the purposes of the Act, as set out in subsection 1 which
include providing protection for residential tenants from unlawful evictions, and
balancing the rights and responsibilities of residential landlords and tenants. 
In addition, the decision references subsection 3(1) of the Act which sets out
that the Act “applies with respect to rental units in
residential complexes, despite any other Act and despite any agreement or
waiver to the contrary.”  
19.
The Cowie decision
goes on to state at para. 17:
“Any
interpretation of section 5 (i) of the Act that would … unilaterally cause the
board to be deprived of its jurisdiction … would be contrary to the language of
the section and the intention of the Legislature and would be grossly unfair.  It
would also effectively result in an unwarranted revision of the tenancy
agreement that the parties had made”  
20.
In this case, when the Landlord moved out, I
find he made a unilateral decision that caused the Act to apply after he
vacated.  I do not view this to be an “unwarranted” revision of the tenancy
that is unfair to the Tenant; rather it is a reasonable revision of the tenancy
agreement reflecting the reality of the Tenant’s changed living arrangements.  As
a result of the Landlord’s decision to vacate the Tenant, gained the legal
protection offered by the Act.  
21.
The Landlord and his spouse, expecting their
first baby, purchased a new primary residence and permanently vacated the
rental unit in order to permanently move into their family home.  This action
caused the exemption set out in subsection 5(i) to cease to apply as the Tenant
was no longer required to share a kitchen or bathroom with the owner or a
family member of the owner. Once the exemption in subsection 5(i) of the Act ceased
to apply, the tenancy became subject to the Act in accordance with subsection 3(1)
of the Act.    
22.
I must determine exactly when the Act began to
apply to this tenancy.  The Landlord testified that he moved out of the rental
unit in January 2018, while the Tenant insisted he moved out in December 2017. 
With no other supporting evidence, I find the Landlord vacated on or before
December 31, 2017, as the Landlord testified he turned the gas to the stove off
sometime before January 1, 2018.  
23.
Therefore, I find the Act applies to this
tenancy as of January 1, 2018, and the Board has jurisdiction to hear and make
determinations on the Landlord’s application for rent arrears.
 
Landlord’s L1
Application for Arrears of Rent
24.
The N4 Notice of Termination claims rent for
December 2017 through April 2018.  The notice clearly sets out that over that
period of time, the Tenant was charged $500 per month in rent, and made no
payments.  I have found the Act did not apply to the tenancy for the month of
December 2017.  As this is a very unique situation and only as of this order
are the parties aware of the application of the Act to this tenancy, I do not
consider the inclusion of December rent arrears on the N4 notice a fatal error
that invalidates the notice.  The notice otherwise substantially complies with
the Act and is not confusing.  It accurately sets out how much rent the Tenant
was require to pay and the amount he paid the Landlord.  Therefore, I find the
Landlord was entitled to file his application for repayment of arrears and
eviction of the Tenant.  
25. The Tenant
has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from January 1, 2018 to July 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective May 14, 2018.
26. The
Landlord’s claim for $500 in rent arrears for December 2017 is denied, as I
have found the Act did not apply to the rental unit until January 2018 and the
Board does not have jurisdiction to award these arrears.
27.
The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
28.
The monthly rent is $500.00
29.
The Landlord is not holding a last month's rent
deposit. 
30.
The Tenant has made no payments since the
application was filed. 
Tenants’ Rights Issue
– Discontinuance in Services at the Rental Unit:
31. Section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(‘the Act’) allows Tenants to raise any issue that could be the subject of a
tenant application tenant under the Act.  In this case, the parties agreed that
the Landlord took the washing machine and dryer with him when he vacated the
rental unit.  The Landlord has not replaced the laundry facilities.  In the
absence of laundry facilities, the Tenant has resorted to doing his laundry in
the sink.  
32. The parties also agreed that the Landlord turned off the
gas to the only stove in the house The Landlord asserted that the Tenant only
ever microwaved his food, so he didn’t think the Tenant would need the gas
stove. The Tenant asserted that he has been incurring extra costs for take-out
meals because he can’t use the stove to cook.  At the hearing, the Landlord
agreed to immediately turn the gas for the stove back on.  
33. Section 130 of the Act sets out that a tenant of a rental
unit may apply to the Board for an order for a reduction of the rent charged
for the rental unit due to a reduction or discontinuance in services or
facilities provided in respect of the rental unit or the residential complex.  
34. In this case, I find that by removing the laundry
facilities and shutting off the gas to the stove in January 2018, the Landlord
discontinued two of the services that were previously provided to the Tenant as
part of the rental arrangement.  Therefore, I find that the Tenant is entitled
to a rebate of rent of $200.00 per month for the months of January to July 2018;
a total rebate of $1,400.00.  This amount shall be applied to the rent arrears
owing by the Tenant.
35. Assuming the Landlord has turned the gas to the stove back on
as he promised during the hearing, the rent will be reduced by $100.00 per
month starting August 2018 on an ongoing basis until laundry facilities are
returned to the rental unit.  If the Landlord has not turned the gas to the
stove back on by July 31, 2018, the rent will be reduced by a further $100.00
per month starting August 2018 on an ongoing basis until the gas to the stove is
turned back on.
36. The Tenant also asserted that he did not have a key to one
of the doors in the rental unit from January to June 2018, that the Landlord
interfered in the Tenant’s relationship with his daughter, and that the Tenant
“had to” take care of lawn and snow maintenance at the rental unit.  The Tenant
did not prove that the Landlord was responsible for these issues, so these
claims are denied.  The Tenant also had claims about the Landlord’s conduct,
including moving all the Tenant’s belongings when staging the house for sale.  However,
as this alleged conduct occurred prior to January 1, 2018, the rental unit was
exempt from the Act at the time and the Board has no jurisdiction to consider
this claim.
37. As the partially successful applicant, the Landlord is entitled
to the application filing fee.
Relief from Eviction 
38.
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until August 31, 2018 pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.  
39.
The Landlord supports his spouse and infant
child, and has suffered financial pressure since the Tenant stopped paying
rent.  The Landlord is financing two homes at this time.  On the other hand, the
Tenant is in his eighties, and has no support from his family because in the
Tenant’s words, he would never ask them for help.  The Tenant has lived in the
rental unit for many years, and is clearly struggling with the concept that he may
have to vacate the rental unit.  I find it would not be unfair to extend the
termination date to August 31, 2018, to allow the Tenant more time to come up
with the rent arrears, or failing that, to allow the Tenant to pack his
belongings and find another place to live.
40. This order contains all of the reasons for this
matter, and no other reasons will issue.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before August
31, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $2,013.82*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to July 25, 2018, less the amount of the $1,400.00 abatement the Landlord
owes the Tenant.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $16.44 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
July 26, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application. 
5.     
If laundry facilities (washing machine
and dryer) are not re-installed in the rental unit before July 31, 2018, then
starting on August 1, 2018, the Tenant is authorized to deduct $100.00 from the
rent per month until the laundry facilities are restored.
6.     
If the gas to the stove is
not turned back on before July 31, 2018, then
starting on August 1, 2018, the Tenant is authorized to deduct an additional
$100.00 from the rent per month until the gas to the stove is restored.
7.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before August 31, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
September 1, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
8.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before August 31, 2018, then starting September 1, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after September 1, 2018.
10.  
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $2,275.00 if the payment is made on or before July 31, 2018, or
ii)       $2,775.00 if the payment is made on or before August 31, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
11.  
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after September 1, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
