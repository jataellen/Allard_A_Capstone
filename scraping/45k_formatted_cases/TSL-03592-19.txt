B.S.C.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict V.G.
and M.K. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe (L1 Application).
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order requiring the Tenants to pay compensation
for the damages caused by them or a person they permitted in the residential
complex (L2 Application).
 
This
combined application was heard in Toronto on April 26, 2019.
 
Only
the Landlord’s representative W.C.K. and the Landlord’s legal representative S.J.S.,
attended the hearing. The Tenants were not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 Application – Arrears
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the
period from January 1, 2018 to April 30, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective January 16, 2019.
2.      The
Tenants are in possession of the rental unit. 
3.      The
monthly rent as of the date of the hearing is $1,341.14 
4.      The
Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $650.00 from the Tenants and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
6.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from November 1,
2014 to January 16, 2019.
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
L2
Application – Damage
8.      In
his L2 application, the Landlord claims compensation in the amount of $7,819.73
for undue damage caused by the Tenants.
9.      At
the hearing the Landlord’s representative submitted photographs showing a
substantial amount of damage to the unit and to the residential complex,
including damaged windows (including the window to the laundry room), doors,
floors (inside the unit and just outside the unit), light fixtures and walls.
The Landlord’s representative testified that the unit was in pristine condition
when the Tenants moved in, as was the floor just outside the unit. The
Landlord’s representative testified that the laundry room window was damaged by
the Tenants when they ran their extension cord into that room to get
electricity. 
10.   At
the hearing the Landlord’s representative submitted a copy of a quotation from
a contractor stating that the cost to repair this damage is $7,819.73.
11.   Based
on the Landlord’s uncontested evidence, I am satisfied, on a balance of
probabilities, that the Tenants caused undue damage to the rental unit and the
residential complex and that the cost to repair this damage is $7,819.73.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before May 12, 2019.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $15,359.22*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to May 1, 2019, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $44.09 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting May 2, 2019 to the date the Tenants move out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May 12,
2019, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from May 13, 2019 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before May 12, 2019, then starting May 13, 2019,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 13, 2019.
8.      If,
on or before May 12, 2019, the Tenants pay the amount of $17,617.36** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after May 13, 2019 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period
of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
L2
Application – Damages
10.   The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $7,819.73, which represents the reasonable
costs of repairing the damage.
11.   If the
Tenants fail to comply with paragraph 10 above on or before May 12, 2019, the
Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated
from May 13, 2019 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
