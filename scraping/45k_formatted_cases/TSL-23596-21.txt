Felix Birasanzwe


Tenant



 
 
Majuri
Sabaratnam and Hardiksh Anand (the 'Landlords') applied for an order requiring
Felix Birasanzwe (the 'Tenant') to pay compensation for the money
the Tenant should
have paid had the
Tenant not misrepresented the Tenant's income or the income of a member of the Tenant's
family
 
This
application was heard by
videoconference on November
16, 2021 at 4:30pm.
Only the second-named Landlord attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Landlords’ L2 application was filed on August 12, 2021
alleging that the Tenant has abandoned the rental unit. This application asks that the Board to issue an order terminating the tenancy on that basis.
 
2.     
By way of background, this was a fixed-term tenancy which
commenced on July 1, 2020 and ended on June 30, 2021.
The lawful monthly
rent is $1,600.00 and is due on the first day of
each month. The residential premises is a bungalow in which the Landlord
occupies the upper level and the Tenant occupies the basement unit.
 
3.     
The second-named Landlord’s uncontested evidence was in February
2021, the Landlord completed renovations to the rental
unit and texted
the Tenant that the unit was
ready to move into; while the Tenant said okay and
paid the rent for the months of February 2021 and June 2021, the Tenant did not
physically move back into the rental unit.
 
4.     
In July 2021, the Landlord attempted to connect with the Tenant
many times through various platforms including text, email and messenger calls
about the rent for July 2021 not being received, but was not successful; on August 9, 2021, the Landlord resorted
to serving a N4 notice of termination for the rent
arrears.
 
5.     
The Landlord conducted an inspection of the rental unit and found
the Tenant’s belongings still there but no sign of habitation.
The Landlord testified that at no point did
they receive a N9 or N11




File Number: TSL-23596-21
 
form from the Tenant.
The Landlord testified that the Tenant’s
phone bill and census forms
still come to the rental unit.
 
ANALYSIS
 
6.     
The Board’s Interpretation Guideline 4 entitled
Abandonment of a Rental Unit explains the concept of abandonment as follows:
 
Abandonment is a unilateral act by the tenant
to relinquish their
tenancy and give
up possession of the rental unit without properly giving notice of
the termination to the landlord …
 
[Emphasis added.]
 
7.     
The problem with the Landlords’ application is that the evidence
before me establishes that a N4 notice of termination was given to the Tenant
prior to the filing of this application which gave the Tenant the option to
either pay off the arrears by the termination date an continue his tenancy or
move out. While it is unclear
what option the Tenant chose due to a lack of communication on the
Tenant’s part, it cannot be said that the Tenant unilaterally terminated his tenancy
by abandoning the rental unit.
 
8.     
Subsection 37(2) of the Act
states:
 
37(2) If a notice of termination is given in accordance with this Act and
the tenant vacates the rental unit in accordance with
the notice, the tenancy is terminated on the termination date set out in the notice.
 
9.     
Given all of the above, I am not satisfied that the Tenant
has abandoned their
tenancy.
 
10.   As a result, the Landlords’ application for termination of the tenancy
on the ground of abandonment
must be dismissed.
 
11.   This order contains all of the reasons for my decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
