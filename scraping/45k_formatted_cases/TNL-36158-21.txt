In the matter
of:


LOWER UNIT, 562
KINGSTON ROAD TORONTO ON
  M4P1P9


 




Between:


Fereidoun
  Mansourian


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Joseph
Bernard Curtis


Tenant



 
 
On November
12, 2021, Fereidoun Mansourian (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Joseph Bernard Curtis (the 'Tenant') and for an order to
have the Tenant pay compensation for damage the Tenant owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the mediated settlement issued by the
Board on October 5, 2021 with respect to application TSL-20532-21 AND
TSL-20544-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The mediated settlement
provided that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the
Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the settlement.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the settlement:
 
The Tenant was to clean and
restore the rental unit (including the balconies) to a safe and uncluttered
condition by November 1, 2021. Specifically,
all floors to be cleared of clutter and debris and all baseboards accessible to
allow for unencumbered access for pest control
treatments and to address any maintenance
repairs that may be required. Additionally,
all escape routes, pathways, and windows are to be cleared and accessible and
meet Fire Code requirements.
 
On November 2, 2021, an inspection was conducted and found that the Tenant
did not commence a full clean up of the unit. The Tenant has kept the unit in a bad state of clutter, damage,
and uncleanliness. The floors and
pathways of the unit have continued to build up and accumulate debris and clutter.
There has been no
improvements in the current state of the unit.
 
3.    
The Landlord
is requested $20,340.00 towards damage. This was not part of the
mediated settlement between the parties and cannot be awarded.
