Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number:
SWL-57693-22




In the
matter of:


MAIN FLOOR, 58 HINCKS STREET ST. THOMAS ON N5R3N6


 




Between:


Zonia Wasik


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Kyle Colman


Tenant



 
On January
31, 2022, Zonia Wasik (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Kyle Colman (the 'Tenant') and for an order
to have the Tenant pay the
rent the Tenant owes because
the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the Board on
November 12, 2021 with respect to application SWL-53680-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant
if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenant
failed to pay to the Landlord
the lawful rent on or before January
1, 2022.
 
3.       
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$186.00 for and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order SWL-53680-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is
$186.00 and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous order SWL- 53680-21
is cancelled.
 
4.       
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,100.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenant for the period from March 31, 2020 to February 24, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
Order SWL-53680-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before March 7, 2022.




File Number: SWL-57693-22
 
3.       
As of the date of this order, the
Tenant owes no money to the Landlord because the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit
exceeds the that the Landlord is entitled to under this order by
$915.10.
 
4.       
The Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenant:
$36.60 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 25,
2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.       
The Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money
that is owed as a result of this order.
 
6.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 7, 2022, then starting March
8, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 8, 2022.
 
 
February 24, 2022
