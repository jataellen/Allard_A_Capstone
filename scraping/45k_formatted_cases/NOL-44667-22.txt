Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44667-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


604B, 720 CAMBRIAN HEIGHTS DRIVE
  SUDBURY ON P3C5L8


 




Between:


2510941 Ontario Ltd


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Rose -Marie A Bobiwash


Tenant



 
 
On December 29, 2021, 2510941 Ontario Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Rose
-Marie A Bobiwash (the 'Tenant')
and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the
Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on
October 1, 2021 with respect to application NOL-43188-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed
to pay to the Landlord
$500.00 on or before December
20, 2021 towards arrears of
rent.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $5,336.00 for rent
arrears in Order NOL-43188-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $4,336.00 and that amount
is included in this
order. As a result, the previous order NOL-43188-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,150.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 28, 2020 to January 19, 2022.




File Number: NOL-44667-22
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Order NOL-43188-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 30, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$3,184.83*. This amount represents the rent owing up to December 31, 2021, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $37.81
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
30, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 31, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 30, 2022, then starting
January 31, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 31, 2022.

the Board will schedule a hearing.
