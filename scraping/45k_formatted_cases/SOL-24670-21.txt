Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24670-21
 



In the matter
of:


1, 38 BLENHEIM DRIVE STONEY CREEK ON L8E1W2


 




Between:


Pat Deluca


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Jeffrey Levair Shawna Lewis


Tenants



 
 
Pat Deluca (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Jeffrey Levair and Shawna Lewis (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 14, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Paul Startek, attended the hearing. As of
2:45 p.m. the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from April
1, 2021 to October 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August
20, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,900.00.
 
4.    
The Tenants
paid $1,800.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,900.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
The application is
amended to reflect that the last month’s rent deposit was collected on July 9,
2019. Consequently, interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for
the period from July 9, 2019 to October 31, 2021.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy is
terminated as of October 31, 2021, the date the Tenants gave vacant possession
of the rental unit to the Landlord.




File Number: SOL-24670-21
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $7,794.75*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to October 31, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the
full amount owing* on or before February 3, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 4, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
