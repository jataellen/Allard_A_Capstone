Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-03847-18










 
 

EG
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict MMF
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges and related administration
charges.
 
This
application was heard in Newmarket on May 28, 2018, and adjourned to July 18,
2018.
 
Only the Landlord attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Preliminary Issue:  the Tenant’s Attendance at the Hearing
 
1.      The
Landlord’s application was heard at approximately 10:25AM.  The Tenant was not
present when the matter was heard.
 
2.      After
the hearing had concluded, the Tenant appeared before the Board and presented
the Board’s form that late parties are requested to fill out.  The information
that the Tenant entered into the form, however, is either false, or wholly
unsatisfactory.
 
3.      The
Tenant, for example, indicates in the Board’s form that she arrived at the
Board at 10:00AM.  This is untrue.  
 
4.      It
is my practice to indicate the time index of the Board’s recording of the
hearing when the hearing begins.  In this case, I heard the Landlord’s
application as an uncontested matter at approximately 46:38 into the hearing
recording.  As the hearing block began at 9:30AM, and because I took an
approximately 10 minute recess before 10:00AM, the actual time that the
Landlord’s application was heard was at approximately 10:25AM.  The Tenant,
therefore, did not enter correct information in the Board’s form.
 
5.      The
Tenant also explained in the Board’s late attendance form:  “Sorry!  Got Lost [sic.]”. 
This explanation is unsatisfactory.
 
6.      On
May 28, 2018, the parties appeared before me in Newmarket.  The Tenant was
present on May 28, 2018, and was granted an adjournment of the hearing to
permit her to develop and raise issues under section 82 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) at the next return hearing date.  The
Tenant, therefore, was certainly aware on July 18, 2018 of the Board’s location
in Newmarket.  I accordingly reject the Tenant’s explanation that she arrived
late at the July 18, 2018 hearing, because she had gotten lost on her way that
morning.
 
7.      The
Tenant further wrote in her late attendance form that the reasons for her late
arrival were “to [sic.] much to get into”.  This, of course, is no
explanation at all.
 
8.      On
May 28, 2018, I issued interim bench order TNL-03847-18-IN.  That interim order
required the Tenant to pay rent directly to the Landlord on June 1, 2018 and on
July 1, 2018.  
 
9.      The
interim order also required the Tenant to disclose to the Landlord the Tenant’s
section 82 issues on or before June 7, 2018.
 
10.   The
Tenant did not comply with any provision of my May 28, 2018 order.
 
11.   The
Board has broad jurisdiction to control its own process.  After considering the
circumstances surrounding the Tenant’s failure to attend the proceedings
against her in a timely manner on July 18, 2018, I find that it is appropriate
to issue this order; and to not have the matter reconvened.  The Tenant had
every reasonable opportunity to fully participate in the July 18, 2018 hearing,
including the opportunity to raise issues under section 82 of the Act.  The
Tenant’s explanation for failing to do so is unsatisfactory.
The
Landlord’s Application
12.   The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from February 1, 2018 to July 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective April 10, 2018.
 
13.   At
the hearing, the Landlord adduced evidence that he incurred charges of $135.00
for cheques tendered by or on behalf of the Tenant, which were returned NSF;
and $60.00 for related administration charges.
 
14.   The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $500.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
15.   Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 1, 2017 to
April 10, 2018.
 
16.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.  The Tenant failed to appear before the Board at
the required time, and therefore failed to participate in the hearing without
good cause.  Accordingly, no evidence of the Tenant’s circumstances was adduced
at the hearing.  
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before August 3, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $8,629.24*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to July 23, 2018 and the total charges related
to NSF cheques tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $54.25 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting July 24, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before August
3, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from August 4, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before August 3, 2018, then starting August 4,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after August 4, 2018.
 
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $10,270.00 if the payment is made on or before July 31, 2018, or
ii)       $11,920.00 if the payment is made on or before August 3, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after August 4, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
