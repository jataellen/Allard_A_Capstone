Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-48996-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1604, 405 WATERLOO STREET LONDON ON N6B3R7


 




Between:


Drewlo Holdings Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Shayan Alahyari


Tenant



 
 
 
Drewlo Holdings
Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Shayan Alahyari (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
The Landlord
also applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant has
been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination
date.
 
This
application was heard via videoconference on January 10, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s legal representative, C. Philp, attended the hearing. As of 10:15
a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 Application:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period from October
1, 2020 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective November
5, 2020.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on December
31, 2020. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date
this application was filed.
 
3.    
The lawful monthly rent is $1,495.44.
 
4.    
The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,495.44
from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period from August 1, 2019 to November 5,
2020.

L2 Application:
 
 
6.     At the hearing, the Landlord requested the consent of
the Board to withdraw their L2 application as the Tenant vacated the unit on
December 31, 2020.
 
7.     As the Tenant
has vacated the unit, there is no need to consider the merits of the Landlord’s application to evict the
Tenant. The Landlord’s application is moot.
 
8.     In accordance with subsection 200(4) of the Act, I
consent to the withdrawal of the L2 application.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
Regarding the L1:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of December 31, 2020, the
date the Tenant gave vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,459.27*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to December 31, 2020,
less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before February 7, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 8, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
Regarding the L2:
 
5.    
The Landlord’s L2 application is withdrawn.
