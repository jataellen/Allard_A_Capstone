Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57737-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


1, 5546 LASSALINE AVENUE WINDSOR ON N8T1A9


 




Between:


Windsor Essex
Community Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Cher Evon


Tenant



 
 
 
On February 8, 2022,
Windsor Essex Community Housing Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Cher Evon (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay
the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on December 29, 2021 with respect to
application SWL-54986-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $400.00 arrears
on or before January 20, 2022.
The Tenant did not pay $222.00 rent on or before February 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $1,844.22 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
SWL-54986-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $1,667.41
and that amount is included
in this order. As a result,
the previous order
SWL-54986-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order,
the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from January 1, 2022 to February 28, 2022.




File Number: SWL-57737-22
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SWL-54986-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before March 11, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$2,004.54*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to February 28, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $7.30 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting March 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before March 11,
2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 12, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 11, 2022, then starting
March 12, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 12, 2022.
