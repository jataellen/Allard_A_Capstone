Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jenny Mangaoang Maria Theresa Salvo
  Marialyn Sawan


Tenants



 
Capreit Limited Partnership (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Maria
Theresa Salvo, Marialyn
Sawan and Jenny Mangaoang (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe. The Landlord also
claimed NSF cheque charges and related administration charges.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on February 2, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative,
Jason Paine, attended the hearing. As
of 10:39 a.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the
Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from April 1, 2021 to
February 28, 2022. Because of the
arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective June
30, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,333.67 as of January 1,
2022.
 
4.     The Landlord incurred
charges of $10.00 for cheques
tendered by or on behalf
of the Tenants, which were
returned NSF and $40.00 for related administration charges.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,317.86 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from August
1, 2020 to December 31, 2020.
 
6.    
The Tenants paid $6,109.90
after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the

parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find
that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until March 15, 2022 pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 15, 2022.
 
2.     As of the date of this order,
the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the
arrears of rent, compensation, and any unpaid charges related to NSF cheques
the Landlord is entitled to by $211.14*.
 
3.     However, the Landlord
is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenants: $43.85
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February
25, 2022 to the
date the Tenants
move out of the unit,
and $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     The Landlord or the Tenants
shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before March 15,
2022, then starting March 16, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction
may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord, on or after March 16, 2022.
 
7.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)   $1,586.22 if the payment is made on or before
February 28, 2022, or
ii)  $2,919.89 if the payment is made on or before
March 15, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance
with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after March 16, 2022 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
