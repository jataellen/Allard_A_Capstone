Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44280-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


203, 183 MITCHELL STREET SUDBURY ON P3A2E7


 




Between:


Doj Construction Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Norbert Hoffman


Tenant



 
Doj Construction Ltd. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Norbert Hoffman
(the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant
owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order
issued by the Board on April
22, 2021 with respect to application NOL-41789-21.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 14, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord attended the hearing when the matter
was called at 9:20am.
 
I note the Tenant joined the videoconference hearing
at 10:30am after the matter
had been disposed of.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     This application was filed pursuant
to section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act'). Applications of this nature normally result in the Board issuing
an eviction order without a hearing. However, this application was sent to a
hearing because the alleged breaches were unclear.
 
L4 APPLICATION
 
2.    
The order
provided that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without
notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
3.     At the hearing,
the Landlord testified that as of the date of the L4 application (October 18, 2021),
the Tenant had failed to make the following payments as outlined on order NOL-
41789-21 issued on April 22, 2021:
 
a)    
October 2021 rent not paid on or before
October 1, 2021;
and
 
b)    
$350.00 towards the arrears
not paid on or before
October 1, 2021.




 
4.    
The Landlord further testified that since this breach, the Tenant has continued to breach
by failing to pay the rent and the arrears.
 
5.     Based on the uncontested evidence
before me, I find that the Tenant was in breach of the
order dated April 22, 2021; specifically, the Tenant failed to pay the rent for October 2021 in full and on time; further the Tenant failed to pay $350.00 towards the arrears in full and on time.
 
6.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenant to pay rent or
some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the
payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
7.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $7,933.06 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
NOL-41789-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $7,733.58 and that amount
is included in this order. As a result, the previous
order NOL-41789-21 is cancelled.
 
8.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed
to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from April 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.
 
9.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $850.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
10.  Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2017 to January 27, 2022.
 
11.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Residential Tenancies Act, 2006) and find
that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act. The Landlord is unaware of any circumstances that would
justify relief from eviction.
 
12.  This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     NOL-41789-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 7, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$14,900.28*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to January 31, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $29.60 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.




 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
7, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 8, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 7, 2022, then starting
February 8, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 8, 2022.
