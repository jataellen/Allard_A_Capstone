Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24685-21



In the matter
of:


152 PRINCESS STREET ELORA ON N0B1S0


 




Between:


Eleanor Morris
  John Morris


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


 
Melissa
Koniuch


 
Tenant



 
 
Eleanor Morris and John Morris
(the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Melissa Koniuch (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 14, 2021.
Only the Landlords attended the hearing. As of 3:21 p.m. the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from August 1,
2021 to December 31, 2021. Because of
the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective August 31,
2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
In
April 2020, the Landlords reduced the rent from $1,325.00 to $950.00 because of
the pandemic. As the Tenant was informed, as of January
1, 2022, the rent reverted
to
$1,325.00.
 
4.     The Tenant paid $3,400.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlords’ attempts at negotiating a repayment agreement
were unsuccessful.
 
6.    
The Landlords collected a rent deposit of $1,325.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlords.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent
deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 3, 2020 to December
31, 2020.
 
8.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair
to




 
postpone the
eviction until January 29, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the
Act. Additional time given to the
Tenant to pay the outstanding amount.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant is
terminated. The Tenant must move out
of the rental unit on or before January 29, 2022.
 
2.    
As of the date
of this order, the amount of the rent deposit
and interest the Landlords
owe on the rent deposit exceeds
the arrears of rent and compensation the Landlords are entitled
to by $269.10*.
 
3.    
However, the Landlords are authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount the
Landlords owe the Tenant: $43.56
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 5, 2022 to the date the
Tenant moves out of the unit, and $186.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
4.    
The Landlords or the
Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this
order.
 
5.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 29, 2022, then starting January 30, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after
January 30, 2022.
 
7.    
If, on or before
January 29, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $2,461.00** to the Landlords or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenant could remain in
the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time,
the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after January 30, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
