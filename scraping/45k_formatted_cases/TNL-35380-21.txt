Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Cindy Matthew Deshawn Matthew Kylan Matthew


Tenants



 
 
Paul Margettas and Dimitrios
Margettas (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Cindy Matthew, Deshawn
Matthew and Kylan Matthew (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent
that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 10, 2022. Only the Landlord, Dimitrios Margettas, attended the hearing.
As of 11:37 a.m., the Tenants were not present
or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from October 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective October 20, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on December
31, 2021. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,750.00.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,750.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from September 15, 2019 to October 20, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of December
31, 2021, the date the Tenants gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlords.

2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlords $3,502.31*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to December
31, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing* on or before March 1, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from March 2, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
