Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Joel Dean Jude Constance


Tenant



 
 
111 Whitburn Holdings Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Joel Dean Jude Constance (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay
the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on October 25, 2021 with respect to
application TNL-33630-21.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved by order TNL-35809-21, issued on December
10, 2021. The Tenant filed a
motion to set aside order TNL-35809-21.
 
This motion was heard by videoconference on February 3, 2022.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant attended
the hearing. The Landlord
was represented by Alethia
Hall.
 
The Tenant consulted Tenant Duty Counsel
prior to the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The first issue before the Board is whether or not
there was a breach of order TNL- 33630-21 as alleged
by the Landlord. The Tenant
agrees that he did breach.
He failed to pay the rent for November 2021 on or
before November 1, 2021.
 
2.     The second issue is whether the Board is satisfied,
having regard to all the circumstances, that it would not be unfair
to set aside the eviction order.
(See: s. 78(11)(b) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').)
 
3.     This tenancy commenced approximately fifteen months
ago. The monthly
rent is
$1,110.00 and is due on the first of each month.
 
4.     The Tenant testified that he breached the consent
order issued on October 25, 2021 because he lost his job four days after the hearing. Initially
he testified that he informed the Landlord about this but in
cross-examination, this evidence changed.




 
5.    
The Tenant testified that he
secured employment and began working on November 30, 2021. He also applied for
a loan from the rent bank and was approved for this loan but the Landlord
would not agree to send a letter
that confirmed the Tenant
lives there so the loan funds
were not released from the rent bank.
 
6.    
The Tenant testified that around
the 20th of
December, there was a death in the family and
over the holidays,
he got sick, so he returned to work
on January 10, 2022 which had a negative impact on his income. Since his initial
breach, the Tenant testified he has been able to pay the Landlord $1,900.00.
 
7.    
The Tenant seeks to preserve his
tenancy and proposes a repayment plan whereby the Tenant would pay the rent on time and an additional $260.00 each month
for the next 21
months until the arrears are paid in full; with financial assistance from the
rent bank ($3,3,30.00), the Tenant would require nine months to pay the arrears
off.
 
8.    
On cross-examination, the Tenant
confirmed the first time he communicated with the Landlord since the breach in
November was in December 2021 after receiving approval for his loan from the
rent bank. The Tenant further confirmed that he did not contact the Landlord in
November 2021 and could not recall if he paid anything to the Landlord after receiving his first pay. The Tenant also confirmed
he paid $1,900.00 the weekend
before this hearing.
 
9.    
In the alternative, the Tenant seeks six months
to secure alternative housing as he is not ready to move and is the sole
occupant of the rental unit.
 
10.  The Landlord opposes the Tenant’s motion to set aside
the ex parte order and submits the motion be denied and the stay be lifted
immediately. Since the Tenant’s breach, further arrears have accrued, bringing
the arrears to $5,444.87. The Tenant only made payments the weekend before this hearing
even though he was working
for the months of December
2021, January 2022 and February 2022. The time the Tenant seeks to repay the
arrears is greater than the life of this tenancy. The Landlord submits the
tenancy is unaffordable for the Tenant.
 
ANALYSIS
 
11.  The Board’s expectation is that orders on consent will
be complied with by the parties. The purpose of subsection 78(11)(b) is provide
for the possibility of relief from eviction where there has been a breach of a
mediated agreement or order but there are extenuating circumstances to
consider. The Board is usually interested in knowing whether or not the breach
was unavoidable, or a result of events beyond the tenant’s control. It is also interested in whether or not the tenancy is viable as there is no point in
continuing a tenancy where future breaches are inevitable.
 
12.  The parties came before Board on October
18, 2021 and at that point, the Tenant owed
$2,905.87. The Tenant breached
the first term of the consent order and continued
to breach its terms.




 
13.  The evidence before the Board was the Tenant lost his
job right after consenting to this order – this was not disputed by the
Landlord. So, if what the Tenant is saying is true, the breach in November 2021
was unavoidable. However, given that the Tenant began to work again at the end
of November 2021 and received income on a weekly basis, it is unclear to me why the Tenant
continued to breach
the order between
November 30, 2021 and December 20, 2021 and between
January 10 onwards, until the Tenant’s payment right before the hearing.
Furthermore, since the original hearing date, the arrears have increased almost
double what they were in October 2021.
 
14.  Given all the above, I find that it would be unfair to
set aside the eviction order. The evidence is insufficient to establish the
Tenant’s ongoing defaults were reasonable. Rather the evidence supports
the conclusion that the Tenant
cannot afford the rental unit.
 
15.  With respect to the Tenant ’s request for relief in
the form of a delay of the lifting of the stay of six months, I find this
request to be excessive in length, particularly where the Tenant is the sole occupant of the rental
unit. No further
submissions were made by the Tenant with respect to his
circumstances.
 
16.  As the Tenant is employed, and given the relatively short length of the tenancy,
I believe a delay to February
18, 2022 is warranted.
 
17.  This order contains
all of the reasons
for my decision within it. No further
reasons shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The motion to set aside
Order TNL-35809-21, issued
on December 10, 2021 is denied.
 
2.     The stay of order TNL-35809-21 is lifted February
18, 2022.
