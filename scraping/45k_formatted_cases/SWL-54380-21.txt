Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-54380-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


23 HONEY STREET CAMBRIDGE ON N1T2C8


 




Between:


Amjad Khan


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Donna
Bruckman Rebecca Sheilds


Tenants



 
 
 
Amjad Khan (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Donna
Bruckman and Rebecca Sheilds (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe (L1 application) and
because they have been persistently late in paying their rent (L2 application).
 
This application
was heard by way of video conference on December 20, 2021. The Landlord attended the hearing and was represented by Elizabeth Anani. As of 11:26am the Tenants were not present despite being served with
notice of hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 application:
 
 
1.    
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from January 1, 2021 to December
31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective June 10, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $2,650.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
3.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from October 15, 2019 to June 10, 2021.
 
4.    
The Tenants
paid $2,000.00 after the application was filed.




 
L2 application:
 
 
5.    
The Landlord
served an N8 notice of termination to the Tenants
on May 26, 2021 with a
termination date of July 31, 2021
 
6.    
The Landlord testified that the Tenants
have failed to pay the monthly rent in full and on time each month from March 2019 to
October 2021.
 
7.    
Based on the Landlord’s uncontested evidence, I am satisfied
that the Tenants
have persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
Relief from eviction:
 
8.    
The
Landlord’s legal representative testified that the Landlord has called, text
and emailed the Tenants several times throughout the last year. Each correspondence encouraged the Tenants to reach out the Landlord
to discuss a repayment plan. The
Tenants did not propose a repayment plan.
 
9.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties
and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenants and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from
eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 17, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$18,285.01*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 6, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $87.12
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 7, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
17, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 18,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January
18, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.




 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 18, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant pays the full amount owing as per the L1 application, the tenancy will still
terminate on a non-remedial basis pursuant to the L2 application
