Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-11753-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


1, 23497
WOODBINE AVENUE KESWICK ON
  L4P0L5


 




Between:


Sing Wing
Szeto


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Craig Bernard Nicole M Bernard


Tenants



 
 
 
Sing Wing Szeto (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Nicole M
Bernard and Craig Bernard (the 'Tenants') because they, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant; and because they have
been persistently late in paying their rent.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on February
17, 2022. The Landlord,
represented by Barrington Lue Sang, and the Tenants, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have been persistently late
paying rent. At the hearing
the Landlord agreed to
an order granting
relief from eviction
of the condition the Tenants
pay their rent on time for the next year. I find this to reasonable in all the
circumstances.
 
2.    
The Landlord N5 notice is based on substantial interfere with the Landlord’s lawful
rights and privileges.
 
3.     The Landlord claims the Tenants removed a wooden door
and replaced it with another type of door. The Landlord
is also concern about an above ground
pool and a fire pit in
the back yard. The Landlord’s representative submits that other issues
identified in the notice have been remedied withing the 7 day voiding
period.
 
4.     The Tenants deny that allegation about replacing a
door. The photograph entered as
evidence shows a grainy picture
of a door and there
is no evidence of any other door in
that location.
 
5.     I find there
is insufficient evidence
to conclude the door was
changed.

6.    
The Landlord’s representative spoke to the damage the pool and fire pit will cause to the grass. The notice served on the Tenants is not for damage. The representative also argues that these
items constitute a breach of the tenancy agreement because the Tenants are not
authorized to make changes to the rental unit.
 
7.     The legal test for the N5 notice an interference with
a landlord’s lawful rights and privileges must be substantial. I find that the Tenant’s having these
items in the yard does not constitute substantial interference as required under the Residential Tenancies Act.
 
8.     The request to terminate the tenancy based on the N5 notice
is denied.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord the lawful rent
in full and on time for each consecutive month commencing March 2022 and continuing through
February 2023.
 
2.     In the event the Tenant fails to make the above said
payment in full and on time, the Landlord shall be entitled to apply to the
Board, no later than 30 days after a breach of this Order, without notice to the Tenant, for an Order terminating the tenancy and evicting
the Tenant, pursuant to Section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before March 8, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated
from March 9, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
