On February 8, 2022, Karleen Girn

is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the
rental unit on or before March 7, 2022.

$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing on or before March 7, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 8, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 7, 2022, then starting
March 8, 2022, the

that the eviction may be enforced.
