Steve Benson (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Aaryn Brown and Jason
Cougeon (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants failed to meet a condition

Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.

•        
The lawful rent for December on or before

$200.00 on or before
December 15, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 4, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 4, 2022, then starting February
