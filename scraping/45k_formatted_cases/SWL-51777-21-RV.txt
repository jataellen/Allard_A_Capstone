Review Order
 
Sally Mancini and Dan Gilbert (the ‘Landlords’) applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Jamie Porter and Trevor Reisner
(the ‘Tenants’) because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was resolved
by order SWL-51777-21 issued on August
26, 2021.
 
On September 3, 2021, the Tenants
requested a review of the order and that the
order be stayed until their request to review the order is resolved.
 
On September 9, 2021, interim order
SWL -51777-21-RV-IN was issued, staying
the order issued on August 26, 2021.
 
The request was heard by videoconference on December 3, 2021. The request to review was granted. The application was heard on
December 3, 2021, and December 17, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s Legal
Representative, Jenna Deforge, the Landlords, the Tenants’ Legal
Representative, John Kulikowski, and the Tenants
attended the hearing
on December 3, 2021.
The hearing was adjourned as additional time was required.
 
At the return on December 17, 2021, the Landlord’s Legal
Representative, Jenna Deforge,
the Landlords, the Tenants’ Legal
Representative, John Kulikowski, and the Tenants attended the hearing.




 
Determinations:
 
Request to Review
 
1.       
The Tenant, Trevor Reisner,
testified he was aware of the hearing,
had issues he wished to raise, and attempted to
participate but was unable to due to technological difficulties.
 
2.       
This Tenant testified that on the
day of hearing the webpage was unable to load. The Landlords’ submitted
evidence the server was functioning on the date of the hearing and that the Tenants disconnected the modem as of September
13, 2021. However,
this does not seriously
challenge this Tenant’s evidence as the disconnection information post- dates
the hearing date and the Tenant did not assert server issues but instead
testified there were issues with internet speed.
 
3.       
When asked why he did
not make attempts to connect
via alternate means or contact the Board, and Landlords or the Landlords’ Legal Representative, Trevor
Reisner advised: he was not aware that calling
in was an option, when he had previously contacted the Board
he did not receive a response, and he was not
comfortable contacting the Landlords or, it is inferred,
their representative.
 
4.       
This Tenant was then self-represented and was separated from the other Tenant, Jamie Porter, so she was not at the
rental unit. He also testified he has a learning disability which makes it
difficult to communicate.
 
5.       
As provided by the Divisional Court in
King-Winton v. Doverhold
Investments Ltd., 2008
CanLII 60708 (ON SCDC) at para. 3, being reasonably able to participate in the
proceeding must be interpreted broadly.
 
6.       
I
was satisfied the Tenants were not reasonably able to participate in the proceeding, genuinely intended to
participate, and have not had an opportunity to be heard.
 
7.       
The Tenants’ request to review was granted and the application was heard de novo.
 
Preliminary Issue
– Notice of Termination
 
8.       
The Tenants raise the validity of
the Certificate of Service for the Notice of Termination for non-payment of rent (N4) and length
of the notice period provided.
The Tenants also take issue with when the
N4 was served and assert it was served in the month following
the date on the Certificate of Service.
 
9.       
The termination date on the N4 is
April 26, 2021. The Tenants’ Legal Representative indicated the termination
date on the N4 appeared to have been altered from April 25, 2021. Alteration of
the date of service from April 12th to the 11th was also alleged as an issue on the Certificate of Service. The Tenants’ Legal
Representative submits the dates
were modified after the fact as the Landlords realized they had not provided a
proper length of notice.
 
10.    Both Landlords testified Sally Gilbert completed the paperwork.




 
 
 
11.   
The Certificate of Service provides
Dan Gilbert effected
service. Sally Gilbert
testified she amended the date
of service when she realized she had made an error and the N4 was served on the
11th and not the 12th. This is corroborated by an initialed
notation on top of the N4 which indicates “served 4/11”.
 
12.    Sally Gilbert testified she signed the Certificate of Service as she was present when her
husband served the N4. She also testified that her daughter signed it as a
witness. A Certificate of Service is to be signed by the person who served the
documents. As a result, the Certificate of Service cannot
be relied on to demonstrate service. However, a Certificate of Service is not the only
way service may be proven. The Landlord, Dan Gilbert, was present and testified
at the hearing.
 
13.    Dan Gilbert recalled sitting in the car outside the rental unit with his wife, Sally Gilbert. He testified she became upset as there
was an incorrect date on the N4 and changed the Termination Date on the N4
before he served it. Sally Gilbert testified the Termination Date on the N4 was
April 26, 2021 when it was served.
 
14.    Dan Gilbert testified he served the N4 on the Tenants
at the rental unit by placing it in their mailbox. He did not recall the exact date but relied
on the date in the
Certificate of Service. As set
out above, this was filled in by Sally Gilbert and provides service was
effected on April 11, 2021, and is corroborated by the notation on the top of
the N4 “served 4/11”. He also testified he did not serve an N4 after this date.
 
15.    The Tenant, Trevor Reisner, testified he received
multiple N4s. He said he had multiple notices
with different numbers
on them and that the earliest was dated
April 9, 2021. He advised he found
the N4 with the Termination Date of April 26, 2021 taped to his door in
May. I did not understand the Tenant to suggest he received another N4 after
this date. The Tenant mentioned discussions in April about how much
money was owed which he found frustrating as the Landlord kept
changing the numbers.
 
16.    This Tenant also testified notices of entry were
served and that he received a bunch of notices in April. Taping a notice to a
front door is only an effective method of service for notices to enter. However,
the Tenant said all three N4s were taped to his front door and
that whenever a notice was taped to his door the Landlords sent him a photo of
it. None of the notices
or communications the Tenant referenced regarding notices were provided
to the Landlords or Board in advance of the proceeding, and neither the
Landlords nor the Tenants placed these in evidence.
 
17.    I found the Tenant’s evidence was at times confused.
Accepting the Tenant had an N4 dated April 9, 2021, and two other N4s which had
different amounts on them, it is more internally consistent with the Tenant’s
evidence that these were delivered in April at the time the Tenant testified there were discussions about amounts owing
and was frustrated about the amount owing changing.
 
18.   
While the Landlords’ evidence
demonstrated they committed errors in completing the paperwork, overall
I find their evidence on the issue of
service more credible
than that of the Tenant.




 
 
 
19.   
I
find the N4 was
served by Dan Gilbert on April 11, 2021, when he
placed it in the Tenant’s mailbox.
 
20.    The N4 provides
the Termination Date was April 26, 2021. The Tenants
did not raise any issues with
the content of the N4. Their position is that the date was amended after the
fact as set out above. However, based on the evidence of the Landlords, I find
the Termination Date was altered before it was delivered to the Tenant.
 
21.    As I have found the N4 was served on April
11, 2021, and the termination date was April
26, 2021, the N4 was served 15 days in advance of the termination date. An N4
must be provided at least 14 days before the termination date. As a result, I find the Tenants were properly served with a valid N4.
 
Arrears Determinations
 
22.    The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from February 1, 2021 to December
31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective April 26, 2021.
 
23.    The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
24.    The lawful monthly
rent is $2,000.00.
 
25.   
The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,900.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
26.    As there was a suspension of guideline increases under
section 120 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for 2021, there is no interest
owing to the Tenants for the
period from June 29, 2020 to April 26, 2021.
 
27.    The Tenants paid $6,000.00 after the application was filed.
 
28.    The parties agree
the amount outstanding to December 31, 2021 inclusive of rent arrears ($12,550.00) and costs ($186.00)
and $12,736.00.
 
Section 83 Considerations
 
29.    The relationship between
the Landlords and Tenants has deteriorated. The Landlords
seek a standard order for eviction. The Tenants seek a payment plan.
 
30.    The Landlords testified that as a result of the rental
arrears owed by the Tenants they were forced to sell their own home to avoid
bankruptcy. The Landlord, Sally Gilbert, also testified the sale of their home was the fastest way to avoid bankruptcy and the
actions of the Tenants were the start
of their issues that created a domino effect as they had to pay multiple mortgages.




 
31.   
In addition, the Landlord,
Sally Gilbert, has significant health
issues and requires additional care and the Landlord,
Dan Gilbert, is not working.
 
32.    The Landlords admitted they were running a rental
property business of which they are now trying
to divest themselves. They own multiple
properties and testified
it is difficult to list and
sell these although they are attempting to do so. The Landlord, Sally Gilbert,
admitted they had a different
tenant at a separate
property who was also in arrears in the
approximate amount of $12,000.00 and to whom they gave money to leave as it is easier
to list a vacant rental unit.
 
33.    The Tenants were separated for a period of time when
the Tenant, Jamie Porter, left the rental unit around March and returned in the
fall. She did not object to being a named Tenant in this application. During the time the Tenants
were estranged, the other Tenant, Trevor Reisner, testified he had
one income. In addition, he was laid off and COVID made it hard to work. He
received CERB and once those payments ceased, he found a position where he has
been working and trying to catch up on rent.
 
34.    The Tenants have resided in this rental unit for
approximately one year. They have two children
who attend the local elementary school located a 15 to 20-minute walk from the rental unit.
 
35.   
The Tenants have someone who is
able to help them pay down arrears; however, no evidence as to how much could
be paid when was provided. They do not have anyone they can stay with if evicted.
The Tenant, Trevor Reisner,
did not know how long
it would take them to find another
place to live as it was his understanding there is a housing crisis in the city. The last time he contacted community housing he understood there was a 3 to 4
month wait list.
 
36.   
The Tenants propose paying an additional $500.00 to $1,000.00
a month as well as rent in full and on time on the first of the month. Their
combined monthly income is approximately $4,800.00 and, including rent, they
have approximately $3,100.00 in monthly expenses. I find the Tenant’s proposal to pay $1,000.00 feasible
in terms of their
income and expenses.
 
37.    The Landlords object to the payment plan as they said
they previously made multiple reasonable offers to reduce the monthly expenses
and tried to work with the Tenants,
but the Tenants declined. They do not trust the Tenants will meet the
terms of any payment plan. The failure to meet a payment plan can be addressed
by imposing a term under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
“Act”).
 
38.    I find the Tenants’ proposed
payment plan reasonable and will provide
the Tenants with the opportunity to cure their rental
arrears. There is nothing that prevents the Tenants from paying the full amount
of their arrears earlier.
 
39.   
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find it would not be
unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(a)
and 204(1) of the Act. As
this order is being issued in January, I have delayed the deadline for the
payment of




 
January’s rent to ensure the
Tenants have notice of the consequences if they miss this payment. Of course, if January’s rent has already
been paid, the Tenants need not pay it
twice.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The request to review
order SWL-51777-21 issued
on August 26, 2021 is granted.
