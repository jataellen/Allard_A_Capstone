Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number:
SWL-55094-21
 



In the matter
of:


39376 REID ROAD WINGHAM ON N0G2W0


 




Between:


Harry Jaretzke


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Amanda
O'Handley Justin Flynn


Tenants



 
 
Harry Jaretzke
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Justin
Flynn and Amanda O'Handley (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on January 6, 2022. Only the Landlord and their
Legal Representative, Matthew Armstrong, attended the hearing. As of 10:16
a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay
for the period from July 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective September 20, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $725.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $725.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from May 1, 2017 to
September 20, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenants paid $3,625.00 after
the application was
filed.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the parties and whether
the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 28, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $370.52*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
17, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $23.84 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 18, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing*
on or before January 28, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 29,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 29, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 28, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $1,636.00** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January 29, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
