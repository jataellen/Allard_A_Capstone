In the matter
of:


LOWER UNIT, 87 WEST ROAD HUNTSVILLE ON P1H1L9


 




Between:


Jeff Lovegrove
  Mark Firman


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Mark Balzan


Tenant



 
 
 
On January 12, 2022, Jeff
Lovegrove and Mark Firman (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Mark Balzan (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the
Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because
the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on December 9,
2021 with respect to application CEL-02106-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlords’ application under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”) alleges that the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on
December 9, 2021 with respect to application CEL-02106-21 that the Tenant pay
$1,786.00 in costs and arrears on or before November 15, 2021.
 
2.     The Landlords’ application was filed with the Board on January
12, 2022.
 
3.    
In accordance with paragraph 3(a)
of the aforesaid order, and in accordance with subsection 78(5) of the Act, an
application under section 78 of the Act shall not be made more than 30 days after a failure of a tenant
to meet a condition in a previous
order of the type described in subsection 78(1) of
the Act.
 
4.    
More than 30 days having elapsed
between the Tenant’s
alleged breach and the filing of
this application, the Landlords are therefore statute-barred from pursuing an
application under section 78 for the breach alleged in their application.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlords' application under section 78 of the Act is dismissed.
 
2.     Order CEL-02106-21, issued
on December 9, 2021 remains
in effect.
