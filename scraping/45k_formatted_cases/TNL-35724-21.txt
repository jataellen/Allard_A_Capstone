Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-35724-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1903, 390 DIXON ROAD ETOBICOKE ON M9R1T4


 




Between:


Telechia Haye


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


El-alamein Shah Muhammed


Tenant



 
 
 
Telechia Haye (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict El-alamein Shah Muhammed (the 'Tenant')
because the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February
9, 2022 at 11:57
PM, having previously been
adjourned on January 6, 2022.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant
attended all hearings. The Landlord
was represented by Silvat
Syed. The Tenant conferred with
Tenant Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
For the reasons set out below, I
find that the Landlords in good faith require possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation for a period of at least one year.
Therefore, the tenancy is terminated effective March 31, 2022.
 
2.     On September 10, 2021, the Landlords served the
Tenants with an N12 notice of termination seeking termination of the tenancy
for the purpose of residential occupation by the Landlord. The termination date set out in the
N12 notice is November 30, 2021.
 
3.     The Landlord paid the Tenant
compensation equal to one month's
rent on October 7, 2022.
 
Good faith
 
4.     The N12 was served pursuant to section 48 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”). Section 48(1) requires that, in
order to be successful in this application, the Landlord must establish that at the time of the service
of the N12 Notice, she required,
in good faith, the unit for residential use.




 
 
 
5.     In Feeney v. Noble, 1994 CanLII 10538 (ON SC),
the Court held that the test of good faith is genuine intention to occupy the
premises and not the reasonableness of the Landlord’s proposal. This principle was upheld in Salter v.
Beljinac 2001 CanLII 40231 (ON SCDC) where
the Court held that the “good faith”
requirement simply means that the Landlord sincerely intends to occupy
the rental unit. The Landlord may also have additional motives for selecting a
particular rental unit, but this does not affect the good
faith of the Landlord’s notice.”
 
6.     The Landlords submitted an affidavit with his
application that he in good faith requires possession of the rental unit for
the purpose of residential occupation for a period of at least one year, which
was supported by oral testimony outlining the Landlord’s circumstances of
purchasing the rental unit in 2021 subsequent to her divorce, so that she might
live there with her two children. As the Tenant
did not substantively challenge the good faith intention of the Landlord, I find that
good faith has been proven on a balance of probabilities by the Landlord.
 
Relief from eviction
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until March 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
8.     The Landlord had to sell her previous house subsequent
to a divorce in October 2021, and has spent recent months living with her parents, along with many other members
of her extended family. She
shares a room with her two children. The
lack of privacy is taking a clear emotional toll on the Landlord. A prompt termination date is sought
by the Landlord.
 
9.    
The has lived in the rental unit
for 11 years. He indicated that the
combination of his current employment situation and increased market rents
is making it challenging for him
to find alternate accommodation. He
currently has a roommate in the rental unit.
He indicated having a broken ankle that impairs his mobility, though no
supporting evidence was provided. He
had asked for four months to find alternate accommodation.
 
10.  Despite any deficiencies in the Tenant’s proof of
compounding factors, I accept the general premise that increases in market rent will present
challenges in finding
alternate accommodation within his
current financial circumstances, and have given
to the end of March, which will be nearly two months after the hearing,
and seven months after the N12 was served on him. While the delay
is doubtless an inconvenience to the Landlord
and her children, I do not consider it as rising to the level of unfairness.
 
11.  The Tenant also raised issues relating to the current
maintenance of the kitchen, specifically ongoing issues with kitchen cabinets
and an uninstalled countertop. These
matters were substantively addressed in a previous order of the Board under
file number TNT-26577-20, and it was the Landlord’s testimony, supported by photographic evidence, that the issues had been resolved. The Tenant acknowledges that the
countertop had been replaced, but that not all cabinets
had been reinstalled. Having viewed photographs




 
of the current state of the kitchen, I accept that a few cabinets remain
outstanding, but that the maintenance
issue is not a “serious breach of the landlord’s responsibilities
under the Act” within
the meaning of subsection 83(a) of the Act, as the kitchen
is plainly functional and there
is nothing to point to a serious
ongoing breach of any maintenance obligations. The outstanding issue therefore does not bar me from granting
the Landlord’s application.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
March 31, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 31, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$3,024.80, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from December 1, 2021
to February 18, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $37.81
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from February 19, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The foregoing amounts
shall be offset
against amounts paid to rent for the rental periods December 1, 2021 until the Tenant
move out of the rental unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing on or before March 1, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 2, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 31, 2022, then starting April 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after April 1, 2022.
