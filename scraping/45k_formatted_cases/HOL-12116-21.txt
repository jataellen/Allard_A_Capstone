Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12116-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


151 DURHAMVIEW CRESCENT WHITCHURCH-STOUFFVILLE ON L4A1S2


 




Between:


Sritharan Ratnasabaphaty
  Sutharmini Sritharan


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Alise Burnett
  Tyrone Less


Tenants



 
 
 
Sritharan Ratnasabaphaty and
Sutharmini Sritharan (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Tyrone Less and Alise Burnett (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe (L1); and because they, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone
they permitted in the residential complex have substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlords or another tenant; and because they have
been persistently late in paying their rent (L2).
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on February
17, 2022. The Landlord,
represented by Sean Leonard O’Connor, attended the hearing.
 
The Tenant Alise Burnett, met
with Duty Counsel and attended mediation. The
Tenant disconnected from the process three times. I went to the main room to speak to the moderators to find out if the Tenant had
returned. I then waited for the
Tenant to return. The Tenant had
provided no explanation why she was leaving the hearing.
 
After waiting for the Tenant to return and considering the fact the Tenants have not paid rent or utilities for more than one year, the
application proceeded in the Tenant’s absence.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the
period from March 15, 2021 to March 14, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords
served a Notice of Termination
effective August 22, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants have been persistently late paying rent and now owe the Landlords nearly
$2,000.00 in unpaid utility
costs. Because of these findings
this order cannot be voided by the Tenants.




 
3.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
4.     I find that the prejudice
is extraordinary and that this order should be expedited. The Landlords are living with a relative and have lost a
significant amount of money they cannot afford.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 1, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlords $33,542.44*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 18, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $98.63
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 19,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $201.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the
Landlords the full amount owing* on or before March 1, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from March 2, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 1, 2022, then starting
March 2, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) is requested to expedite
the enforcement of this order and is
directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlords, on or after March 2, 2022.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on September 2, 2022
if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court

unit is located.
