File Number: TSL-23789-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


1017, 105 WEST
LODGE AVENUE TORONTO ON
  M6K2T8


 




Between:


Hazelview Property Services Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kathleen Edwards Paterson Hodgson


Tenants



 
 
 
Hazelview
Property Services Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Paterson Hodgson and Kathleen Edwards (the 'Tenants') because
they have been persistently late in paying their rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on December 7, 2021.
 
The Landlords
Legal Representatives Douglas
Levitt and Natasha
Mizzi, and the Tenant’s Legal Representative Matthew Oppenheim
and the Tenant Paterson Hodgson attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant’s
representative requested on a preliminary basis that the application be
dismissed on basis that the notice on termination does not show a valid cause of action.
In particular, the N8 notice of termination alleges consistent late payments,
whereas it only shows a pattern of non-payments.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s representative responded by suggesting it was a matter of semantics in terms of the difference between late
payments vice non-payments.
 
3.    
In this regard I disagree with the Landlord’s representative. Section 59 of the Act sets out
that a Landlord may serve a notice of termination (N4) for arrears of rent,
meaning for rent that is owed, not
late. Whereas, section 58 of the Act sets out that a Landlord may serve a
notice of termination (N8) for consistent late payments, meaning that payments
are being made, albeit in a consistent late manner.
 
4.    
Further each provision provides
for different remedies,
of which I would suggest
that the most substantial is
that for arrears (non-payment) of rent the Tenant is afforded the




 
opportunity to void an eviction order
for arrears under section 78 of the Act, whereas
for late payments there is no voiding option.
 
5.    
Therefore, it is possible
for applications to have the same or similar facts and evidence
in order to succeed, but that is where the similarities end, and where
differences in remedies standout.
 
6.    
The Landlord
representative referred to order TNL-24918-14 issued March 5, 2015 to
demonstrate that where the Tenant had deliberately withheld rent due to
maintenance issues that this was found to be late payments.
I would distinguish it from this application in that it involved numerous
issues, more specifically that the Tenant admitted to withholding payments for
a six month period due to his interpretation of the Act that he was permitted to do
so for the Landlord’s failure to respond to maintenance issues. I also note that at paragraph 17, the
decision states that the Tenant knew which periods the Landlords were alleging
rent had not been paid on time.
 
“In Ball (Ball
v. Metro Capital Property, [2002] O.J. No. 5931 (Div. Crt.)) the court found
that the notice, for which the tenant’s conduct was at issue, lacked the
required specificity such as dates, times and alleged conduct engaged in by the Tenant
so that she could know the case made against
her. As I stated at the
hearing, I am satisfied that the N8 notice contains sufficient information so
that the Tenant knew for which period the Landlords were claiming he had not
paid rent on time. As a result, the Tenant’s request that the N8 notice be
found to be defective is denied.”
 
7.    
There was no confusion
about late payments
and the deliberate non-payments which might have rendered the N8
defective.
 
8.    
In this case, there is
no evidence that the Tenant is withholding rent for maintenance issues. It was uncontested that the Landlord
was also pursuing
eviction for arrears
of rent, for which the hearing had been adjourned and not yet
rescheduled.
 
9.    
The Landlord’s
representative referred to TEL-06346-19 issued May 12, 2020. I would also distinguish that order on basis that by the hearing
the Tenant admitted
to withholding payments for
maintenance issues after the N8 was served. However,
the N8 was based solely on a pattern of late payments, and that the
deliberately withheld payments came after the notice of termination was served. The Tenant admitted to the late payments.
 
10.  In the present
case, the N8 does not allege late payments, it sets out a consistent pattern of non-payments.
 
11.  I referred the parties to order
TNT-95222-17 issued November 17, 2017 in which the member found the N8 to be defective for only showing
non-payments at paragraph 36:
 
“I also find the Landlord’s N8 notice to be invalid.
The notice stated that the Tenant had persistently paid the rent
late by failing to pay any rent for February through June, 2017.”




 
 
 
 
12.  All of these decisions are not binding
as they have all been issued by the Board.
They do show that there has
been a mixed pattern of late and non-payments and where a combined L2/L1
application was filed that had all been taken into consideration. These facts
distinguish them from the present case.
 
13.  I am satisfied in all of the circumstances that no payment
or non-payment of rent is a
distinct cause of action, with a distinct voidable remedy, whereas late
payments constitutes in own cause of action with its own distinct remedies.
 
14.  In the present
application the N8 dated August
19, 2021 only claims “no payment” from April 1, 2020 to August 1, 2021
by the time the Landlord filed the application on August
23, 2021. The Tenant made payments
after the N8 was served. Of the 4 payments between August 1, 2021 and the date
of this hearing, 3 were late and 1 was on time. However, the issue here is the
validity of the N8, whereas any payments made after receiving the notice of termination may be considered under s.83 of the Act as possible reasons to deny eviction and/or
impose conditions on the Tenant. I
need not take this into consideration in determining if the N8 is valid or
defective.
 
15. 
In order
to establish that payments have been late,
there must be a pattern
of payments made, which in the present case are absent. As a result, the N8 notice of
termination is defective.
 
16.  Therefore,
the Landlords application must be dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1. The Landlord application is dismissed.
