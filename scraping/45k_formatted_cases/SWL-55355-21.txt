Giles Belisle Joseph Boyer


Tenants



 
 
 
Hood Property Management (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Joseph
Boyer and Giles Belisle (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 13, 2022. The Landlord’s Legal Representative, Tim Currie, and the
Tenant, Giles Belisle, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants were in possession of the rental
unit on the date the application was filed.
 
2.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
4.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent for the unit is $936.10.
 
5.    
The only amount outstanding is $221.10 in rent arrears
and the Landlord's cost of filing the application. As a result, the
order will be limited to arrears and costs only and not eviction.
 
6.     The Tenants paid $3,952.50 after the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $221.10, which represents the amount of rent
owing up to January 31, 2022.




File Number: SWL-55355-21
 
2.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before February
28, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from March 1, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
