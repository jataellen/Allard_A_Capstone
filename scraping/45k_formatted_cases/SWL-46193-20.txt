Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-46193-20
 
 
In the matter
of:      52 GEORGE STREET
RIDGETOWN ON N0P2C0
 




Between:                  Kim Osbourne Paul Osbourne


Landlords




 
 
and
 
Janice Logan                                                                                                                    Tenant
 
 
 
Kim Osbourne
and Paul Osbourne
(the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Janice Logan (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlords or another tenant.
The Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 22, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Kimberly
Binder, and the Landlord’s witnesses, Angel Wagener and Devon Wagener, attended the hearing. As of
10:27 a.m., the Tenant was not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this
hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
Since July 2020, the Tenant
has continuously failed
to prepare the rental unit for pest control treatments on multiple
occasions.
 
2.    
This conduct has
substantially interfered with the Landlords' and the other tenants' reasonable enjoyment
of the residential complex. This conduct substantially interferes with a lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlords and the other tenants.
 
3.    
The residential complex
contains 4 units. The Tenant’s behaviour has resulted in the Landlord being
unable to treat
the residential complex for pests. As a result,
the other tenants are
complaining and have threatened to leave.
 
4.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant




File Number: SWL-46193-20
 
relief from
eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Landlord is not aware of
any reason to grant relief and the Tenant was not present
at the hearing to request
relief.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlords and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
January 17, 2022. The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before January 17, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords
$16.54 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from January 7, 2022 to
the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing on or before January
17, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 18, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January
18, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after January 18, 2022.

where the rental unit is located.
