Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-35206-21



In the matter
of:


514, 67 PARKWOODS VILLAGE DRIVE NORTH
  YORK ON M3A2X4


 




Between:


IMH Pool
XV LP


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Dannah Whiteway


 
Tenant



 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
IMH Pool XV LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dannah Whiteway (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed
administration charges related to NSF cheques.
 
This
application was heard by video conference on January 31, 2022. Only the
Landlord's Legal Representative, Sean Beard, attended the hearing. As of 10:00
a.m. the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although properly
served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant did not pay the
total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period from
January 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
28, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is
$1,756.20.
 
4.    
The Landlord incurred charges
of $20.00 for administration charges
related to a cheque
tendered by or on behalf of the Tenant, which was returned NSF.
 
5.    
After the application was filed, the Tenant paid all arrears
for the period ending January
31, 2022 plus $38.80 towards the Landlord’s cost of filing the application.
 
6.    
The only amount outstanding is the Landlord's cost of filing
the application and the NSF
cheque charges. As a result, the order will be limited to costs only and not
eviction.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $167.20, which
represents the balance of the Landlord’s cost of filing the application and the total charges related
to the NSF cheque tendered to the Landlord by or on
behalf of the Tenant.
File Number: TNL-35206-21
 
2.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
22, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 23, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
