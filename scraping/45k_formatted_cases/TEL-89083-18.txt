A.R.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict B.C.
and J.L. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe and because they have been persistently late in paying their rent.
 
This
application was heard in Whitby on April 13, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord’s representative, C.A., attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
THE APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from November 1, 2017 to April 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective December 26, 2017.
2.      The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending April 30, 2018, total $6,700.00.
3.      The
Landlord incurred costs as a result of filing the application in the amount of
$190.00 and is entitled to reimbursement for those costs. 
4.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,200.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from April 1, 2017
to December 26, 2017, in the amount of $13.31.
 
THE APPLICATION FOR
PERSISTENTLY LATE PAYMENT
6.      The
Tenants have persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
According to the information provided by the Landlord’s representative, the
Tenants have paid their rent late 10 out of 13 times since April 2017. 
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It
is ordered that:
THE
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before April 27, 2018.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $4,891.39*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to April 16, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $39.45 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting April 17, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before April
27, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from April 28, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 27, 2018, then starting April 28,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 28, 2018.
8.      If,
on or before April 27, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $6,890.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after April 28, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
THE APPLICATION FOR
PERSISTENTLY LATE PAYMENT
10.   If
the Tenants void the eviction order for non-payment of rent pursuant to
paragraphs 8 or 9 above then the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated, as of April 30, 2018. The Tenants must move out of the rental
unit on or before April 30, 2018.
11.   If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 30, 2018, then starting May 1, 2018,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
12.   Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after May 1, 2018.
