Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24470-21
 
 
In the matter of:      38 WANDA ROAD
ST CATHARINES ON L2T1S6
 




Between:                  Suzanne Jeaurond-Mulder Henry Brouwer


Landlords




 
 
and
 




James Patrick Krystal Reynolds


Tenants




 
 
Suzanne Jeaurond-Mulder and Henry Brouwer (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict James
Patrick and Krystal Reynolds (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay
the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 11, 2022.
Only the Landlords’ Agent,
Ronald Mulder, attended the hearing. As of 11:57 a.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective September 1, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,200.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
6.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 30, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $7,962.45*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 19, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $39.45 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 20, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before January
30, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 31, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 30, 2022, then starting
January 31, 2022, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after January 31, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before January 30, 2022, the Tenants pay the
amount of $8,586.00** to the Landlords or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after January
31, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
