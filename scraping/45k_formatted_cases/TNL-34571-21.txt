Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-34571-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


203, 928 LAKE DRIVE E JACKSONS POINT
ON L0E1L0


 




Between:


Joseph Siragusa Anthony Siragusa


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Lisa White


Tenant



 
 
 
Joseph Siragusa
and Anthony Siragusa (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Lisa White (the 'Tenant')
has substantially interfered with the Landlords' and the other tenants' reasonable enjoyment of the residential
complex.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 988 4914 7021# on January
6, 2022.Only the Landlord
Joseph Siragusa attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has brought
in roommates and the Tenant, her roommates or others they have permitted into
the rental unit, have been frequently partying late at night. The are five other rental units in the
complex and all of the other tenants have been complaining to the Landlord. They are threatening to move unless
something is done about the ongoing noise. Other tenants cannot sleep due to the noise and the police
have attended several times.
 
2.    
I find this conduct
has substantially interfered with the Landlords' and the other tenants'
reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex.
 
3.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlords
and the Tenant is terminated, as of January
31, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 21, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.

3.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount
owing on or before January
21, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 22, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 21, 2022, then starting January
22, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
5.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after January 22, 2022.
