Matthew Smit (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kyle Knee
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 25, 2022. Only the Landlord
attended the hearing. As of 10:21
a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from June 20, 2021 to September 19, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective August 19, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on November
4, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,450.00.
 
4.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,450.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period from December
25, 2020 to August 19, 2021.
 
6.    
The Tenant paid $900.00
after the application was filed.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy is terminated as of November
4, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.




File Number: SOL-24190-21
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $3,619.63*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to November
4, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 11, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 12, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
