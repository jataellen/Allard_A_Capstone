Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-94482-18
 











 
 

A.P (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict E.S.L. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes. (L1 application)
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant and because there are
more people living in the rental unit than is permitted under health, safety or
housing standards. The Landlord claimed compensation for undue damage that the
Tenant has wilfully or negligently caused to the rental unit. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the
termination date. (L2 application)
 
This L1/L2 application was heard in Toronto on May 15,
2018.
 
The Landlord, and the Tenant’s
representative, D.C attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 application
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from February 1, 2018
to May 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective March 30, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant
is in possession of the rental unit. 
3.     
The monthly
rent as of the date of the hearing is $1,950.00.      
4.     
The Tenant
has made no payments since the application was filed.
         
5.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,950.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from December 1, 2016 to March 30, 2018.
7.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
L2 application
8.     
The Landlord served the
Tenant with an N5 Notice to End your Tenancy For Interfering with Others,
Damage or Overcrowding (‘N5 notice’) on March 3, 2018 by mail. Service was
effective five days later, on March 8, 2018. The N5 notice states that the
reasons for the notice are that the Tenant or the Tenant’s guests have
substantially interfered with the Landlord’s or other tenants’ reasonable
enjoyment of the premises and there are more people living in the rental unit
than is allowed by health, safety, or housing standards. The portion of the N5
notice relating to substantial interference gives the Tenant an opportunity to
void the notice by correcting the conduct within seven days of receiving the N5
notice. The portion of the N5 notice relating to overcrowding does not give the
Tenant an opportunity to void the notice.
9.     
The N5 notice sets out
allegations that the neighbours have complained about noise from the rental
unit and a neighbour has complained about a sliding door. The dates in the N5
notice are the dates the Landlord received the complaints. There is no
indication in the N5 notice as to what dates the noise occurred or when the
sliding door issue occurred. The N5 notice does not state what the sliding door
issue is. 
10.   In Ball v. Metro Capital Property, [2002]
O.J. No. 5931 (‘Ball’), the Divisional Court stated that in order to
determine the sufficiency of an N5 notice, it is necessary to consider the
context of the notice. The Court held that the tenant needs to know the
specific allegations against him/her for three purposes: 
a.    
to know the case that must
be met;
b.    
to decide whether to dispute
the allegations; or
c.     
to consider whether to void
the notice.
10.  
Applying Ball to this
case, I find that the N5 contains insufficient details, as it does not contain
a precise enough allegation about the sliding door and it contains no dates upon
which the noise is alleged to have occurred.
11.  
Further, the N5 notice does
not include any details about the overcrowding allegation, nor does it give the
Tenant an opportunity to void the overcrowding portion of the notice.
12.  
For the reasons above, at
the hearing I found the N5 notice to be invalid.
13.  
In the L2 application, the
Landlord claims compensation for damage done to the rental unit. The “damage”
alleged to have occurred is the Landlord has incurred legal fees and had to pay
the fee for this application. These things are not damage. In any event, the
Landlord will recover the application fee through the L1 application. No order
will be made with respect to the damage claim.
14.  
For the reasons above, the
L2 application shall be dismissed.
It is ordered that:
 
Regarding the L1 application:
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the rent
arrears portion of this order as set out below, the tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before June 2, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $5,280.34*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to May 22, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $64.11 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
May 23, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 2, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June 3,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 2, 2018, then starting June 3, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 3, 2018.
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void
the rent arrears portion of this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant
must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $7,990.00 if the payment is made on or before May 31, 2018, or
ii)       $9,940.00 if the payment is made on or before June 2, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside the rent arrears
portion of this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after June 3, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
Regarding the L2 application:
10.  
The L2 application is
dismissed without prejudice to the Landlord filing a new application after
serving a proper notice of termination.
