File Number: CEL-04280-21
In the matter of:      85, 1560 BLOOR STREET
MISSISSAUGA ON L4X1R8
 
Between:                  Capreit Limited Partnership                                    Landlord
 
and
 
Akintunde Tomiwa                                                                                                                 Tenant
 
On November 25, 2021, Capreit
Limited Partnership (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Akintunde Tomiwa (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the
Tenant pay the rent he owes because
the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by
the Board on August 23, 2021 with respect to application CEL-99505-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant
if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following condition(s) specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed to pay to the Landlord
$500.00 on or before November
15, 2021 towards arrears of
rent. This was a breach of the previous consent order.
 
3.       
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$7,367.55 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application
fee in Order CEL-99505-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $5,867.55
and that amount
is included in this
order. As a result, the previous
order CEL-99505-21 is cancelled.
 
5.       
Since the date of the order,
the Tenant has also failed
to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from
September 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.
 
6.       
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,443.99 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenant for the period from May 1, 2021 to January 17, 2022.




 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.       
Order CEL-99505-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before
January 28, 2022 (standard 11
days from the issuance date of this
order).
 
3.       
If the Tenant made any payments
to the Landlord after his L4 application
was filed, those amounts shall be deducted from the calculations below.
 
4.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $7,224.69*. This amount represents the rent owing up to November 30, 2021 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
5.       
The Tenant shall also pay
to the Landlord $47.14 per day
for compensation for the use of the unit starting
December 1, 2021 to
the date the Tenant actually
moves out of the rental unit or gets evicted.
 
6.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after January 29, 2022.
 
 
January 17, 2022

The tenant has until January 27, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 27, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on July 29, 2022 if the order has not been
filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that
has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
