Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number: SWL-56160-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
APT 6, 131
MARGARET AVENUE WALLACEBURG
  ON N8A2A2


 




Between:


Paul Routley


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jody Forthurer


Tenant



 
 
Paul Routley (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jody Forthurer (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February
3, 2022. Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from November 1, 2020 to February 28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination (N4 notice) effective October 16, 2021.
 
2.     The lawful monthly
rent is $450.00.
The rent was increased on January 1, 2021 from
$450.00 to $500.00. This amounts to an 11 percent increase
which is not permitted by the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'). The Landlord included the illegal rent charge in the N4 notice
rendering the notice defective.
 
3.     Since the N4 notice
is defective, the Landlord’s application must be dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
