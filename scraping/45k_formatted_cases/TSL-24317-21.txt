Wojciech
Treszcynski (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Grant Taggart and Sarah Bell (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe and because they have been persistently late
in paying their rent.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 30, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord
and the Landlord’s representative A. Friel attended
the hearing.
 
At the hearing, the Landlord requested
the consent of the Board to withdraw
their L2 application
