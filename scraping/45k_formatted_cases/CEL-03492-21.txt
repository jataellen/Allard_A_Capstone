Harris Cailbe James

Tenants



 
 
2557073 Ontario Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict James Robert
and Harris Cailbe (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on October 18,
2021 with respect to application CEL-99994-21.
(L4 application)
 
This L4 application was sent to a hearing
and the hearing
was held by videoconference on January 19, 2022. Both parties were sent a Notice of Hearing
for this L4 hearing.
 
Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Yan Qi, attended
the hearing. As of 10:05 am, the Tenants were not present or
represented. The hearing commenced at
this time.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants
have not met the following
conditions specified in the October
18, 2021 order:
•        
Only $400.00 of the $1,600.00 arrears
was paid by the Tenants
on August 2, 2021;
•        
Rents ($1,400.00 monthly) due on September 1, 2021, October
1, 2021,
November 1, 2021, December
1, 2021 and January 1, 2022 have not been paid
– nothing has been paid; and
•        
Arrears ($1,600.00 monthly) due on September 1, 2021, October
1, 2021,
November 1, 2021, December
1, 2021 and January 1, 2022 have not been paid
– nothing has been paid.




 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order
required the Tenants
to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenants were ordered to pay
$12,786.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
CEL-99994-21. The amount
that is still owing from that
October 18, 2021 order is $10,786.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order
CEL-99994-21 is cancelled.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order CEL-99994-21 issued on October 18, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the
following order;
 
2.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 4, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $13,586.00*.
This amount represents the rent owing up to January 24, 2022
(date of this order) and the costs related to the application fee for the previous
application.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$46.03 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 25, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or
before February 4, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 5,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 4, 2022, then starting
February 5, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 5, 2022.

The Tenants have until February
3, 2022 to file a motion
with the Board to set aside the order
under s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by February 3, 2022
the order will be stayed and the Board will schedule a hearing.

this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.
 
In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on August 5, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
