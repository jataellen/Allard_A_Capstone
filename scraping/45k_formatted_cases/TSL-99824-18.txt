Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-99824-18










 
 

R.E.P.I.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict M.Z
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. (L1
application)
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the
Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with
the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord
or another tenant; and because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying
the Tenant's rent. The Landlord also requested an order determining that the
Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in
the residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the
premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to
compensate the Landlord for the damage. The Landlord also claimed compensation
for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date. (L2
application)
 
This
combined application was heard in Toronto on November 23, 2018.
 
Only
the Landlord’s legal representative, D.Y, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
            L1 application
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from August 1, 2018 to November 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 25, 2018.
2.      The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
3.      The monthly rent as of the date of the hearing is $1,900.00.
4.      The
Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
5.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,900.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
6.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 21,
2017 to September 25, 2018.
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
L2
application
Utilities
8.      The
Landlord served the Tenant with an N5 notice of termination (‘N5 notice’) on
September 4, 2018 by mail. Service was effective five days later on September
9, 2018. The grounds for the N5 notice were that the Tenant has substantially interfered
with a  lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord. The N5 notice
alleges that the Tenant has failed to pay for utilities for which the Tenant is
responsible.
9.      Based
on the Landlord’s uncontested evidence, I find that the tenancy agreement
provides that the Tenant is responsible to pay for hydroelectricity and for
water/sewage costs.
10.   Based
on the Landlord’s uncontested evidence, I find that the Tenant has not paid for
the costs of hydroelectricity for the rental unit. I therefore find that the
Tenant has substantially interfered with a lawful right, privilege or
interest of the Landlord.
Late
payment of rent
11.   The
Tenant has persistently paid rent late. 
Section
83
12.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
            Regarding the L1 Application
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the rent arrears portion of this order as set out below, the
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before December 10, 2018.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,587.52*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to November 29, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $62.47 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting November 30, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
December 10, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from December 11, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before December 10, 2018, then starting December
11, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after December 11,
2018.
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void rent arrears portion of this order and continue the
tenancy to December 10, 2018 (when the tenancy is terminated for late payments
and substantial interference), the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust:
i)        $7,790.00 if the payment is made on or before November 30, 2018, or
ii)       $9,690.00 if the payment is made on or before December 10, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside rent arrears portion of this order if they pay the amount required under
that subsection on or after December 11, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this
motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
Regarding
the L2 Application
10.   Even if
the Tenant voids the eviction order for arrears of rent above, the tenancy
between the Landlord and the Tenants is still terminated due to persistent late
payment of rent and substantial interference. The Tenant must move out of the
rental unit on or before December 10, 2018.
11.   If the
unit is not vacated on or before December 10, 2018 then starting December 11,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
12.   Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after December 11,
2018.
