In the
  matter of:


8 DALEVIEW COURT PETERBOROUGH ON K9J8E5


 




Between:


Clinton Morris


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Amber
  Bellanger


Tenant



 
 
 
Clinton Morris
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Amber
Bellanger (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 21, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Crystal
Francey, attended the hearing.
 
The Landlord’s Legal Representative submitted a signed N11 Agreement to End
the Tenancy on March 31, 2022 and a signed Settlement Agreement. Both documents were signed and dated for December 16, 2021 by both the Landlord
and the Tenant.
 
I accepted both documents as evidence of consent that the parties
mutually agreed to resolve all matters at issue in this application.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before March 31, 2022.
2.    
The Tenant shall leave the rental unit in a good state of repair and in a broom swept condition.
3.    
The Landlord
provided the Tenant
with the required
compensation of one month’s rent in
the sum of $1,400,00.
4.    
The Tenant’s
last month's rent deposit will be applied
to the rent for March 2022.
5.    
The Tenant is responsible for the rent for the months of December 2021, January 2022 and February 2022.

6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 31, 2022, then starting April 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 1, 2022.
