Landlords




 
 
and
 
Eric Campsall                                                                                                                    Tenant
 
 
Zohal Mohammed, Obaid Sayed and
Omar Sayed (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Eric Campsall (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 11,
2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Francisco Gomez,
attended the hearing. As of 1:58 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the
Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
February 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective August
22, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession
of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,900.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,900.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 1, 2020 to August 22, 2021.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the




 
Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 30, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $20,242.42*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 19, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $62.47
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 20, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount
owing* on or before January
30, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 31, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 30, 2022, then starting January
31, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after January 31, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before January 30, 2022, the Tenant pays the
amount of $22,986.00** to the Landlords or to the Board in trust, this order for
eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and
on time, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
31, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
