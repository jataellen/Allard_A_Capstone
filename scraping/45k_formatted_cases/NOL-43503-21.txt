Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-43503-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


655 MONTROSE AVENUE NORTH BAY ON P1B7G3


 




Between:


Roger Bouchard


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Scott Guindon Steward Macdonald Vanessa Macdonald


Tenants



 
 
 
Roger Bouchard (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Scott Guindon, Steward Macdonald and Vanessa Macdonald
(the 'Tenants') because the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on November
22, 2021.
 
The Landlord and the Landlord’s Representative M. Przybylowski attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord
served the Tenants
with an N12 notice of termination seeking
termination of the tenancy
for the purpose of residential occupation by the Landlord and a person who
provides or will provide care services to the Landlord.
 
2.    
A preliminary issue was
raised with respect to rental unit identification on the Form N12 served by the
Landlord. Subsection 43(1)(a) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”) specifies that a notice of
termination “shall identify the rental unit for which the notice is given.”
 
3.    
The N12 notice served
upon the Tenants incorrectly identifies the rental unit as “665” Montrose Ave,
North Bay, Ontario. The correct
address for the rental unit is “655” Montrose Ave, North Bay, Ontario. Since the rental unit was not correctly
identified as required by subsection 43(1)(a) of the Act, I find that the Form
N12 served was defective.
 
4.     Section 73.1 of the Act
provides that if the Board refuses to grant an eviction order but where
compensation has been given under section 48.1, the Board may order that the
tenant pay back the compensation to the landlord. I have given such relief in the order.




File Number: NOL-43503-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
5.    
The Landlord's application is dismissed, without prejudice.
 
6.    
The Tenants
shall return to the Landlords
any rent compensation paid by the Landlords to the Tenants pursuant to s. 48.1.
