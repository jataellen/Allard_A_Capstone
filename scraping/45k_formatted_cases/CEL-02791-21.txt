Tenant



 
 
 
Quadra-star Investments Limited
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Khurram
Khokhar (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
10, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Iftikhar
Ahmad attended the hearing. As
of 11:00 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the
Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period from June 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective July 11, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
October 14, 2021. The Tenant was in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,960.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,020.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021
to July 11, 2021.




File Number: CEL-02791-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenancy is terminated as of
October 14, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$5,078.41*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to
October 14, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 28, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from
January 29, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
