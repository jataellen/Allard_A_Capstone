Mohammed Durre Abdulbasit


Tenant



 
 
 
Toronto Community Housing
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Mohammed
Durre Abdulbasit (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant has knowingly
misrepresented the Tenant's income or the income of other members of the
Tenant's family who occupy the unit. The Landlord also claimed compensation for
each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard
by video conference on July 20, 2021, beginning
at 9:00 a.m..
 
The Landlord and the Landlord's
Legal Representative Joanna Kraczek attended the hearing. As of 11:15 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at this hearing
although properly served with a notice of this hearing by
the Board. Also present as witnesses were Ayesha Khan and Kathries Cheliyan.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Landlord seeks an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant because the Tenant has knowingly
misrepresented the Tenant's income.
 
2.       
On February 1, 2021 the Landlord
served an N6 Notice to End
Your Tenancy with a termination
date of March 5, 2021.
 
3.       
The residential complex is a multi-unit building, in which
the Landlord offers
subsidized housing to residents. The Tenant M.A. was a recipient of
subsidized rent for his rental unit. The subsidized monthly rent is $226.00.
 
4.       
For the reasons that follow,
the Landlord has proved, on a balance
of probabilities, that the Tenant has misrepresented his
household’s income and, further, the Tenant has misrepresented his residential
status, essentially no longer occupying the unit. The tenancy will be terminated on that basis.




 
5.       
The Landlord is also entitled to
the extra rent that it would have charged if it had known that the Tenant no longer qualified for a subsidy.
The Tenant will be ordered
to pay that amount.
 
6.       
A.K., the Tenant Services
Coordinator, testified about the subsidized housing program. In order to maintain eligibility in the
subsidy in the program, tenants are required to report total household income
and assets for the household on an annual basis. Should the tenant not comply with the
conditions imposed, subsection 56(2) of the Housing Services Act, 2011 (“HSA”)
permits the landlord to charge the tenant the difference between the subsidized
rent and the current market rent.
 
7.       
M.A. informed the Landlord
that he was self-employed as a taxi driver, which at the time
was one of the factors qualifying him for subsidized housing.
 
8.       
The Landlord submits that in
October 2019 an investigation was commenced after receiving reports that M.A.
was not residing in the unit, and that he had submitted fraudulent income
documentation for the purpose of calculating his rent-geared-to-income
(“RGI”) rent amount.
 
9.       
The investigation revealed that M.A. was using alternate addresses in Fort McMurray, AB as his primary residential address,
and documents listed an Alberta area code for his telephone number.
 
10.   K.C. is the investigator, and testified that between
January 1, 2019 and March 5, 2020, A.M.’s fob to enter the residential complex
was accessed once per month,
at most. It was
used solely for entry
into the building
and not used for other facilities, such as the laundry room located in the building.
The person identified on video surveillance cameras in the building as using
the fob was identified as M.A.’s brother A.A.
 
11.   A.A. was observed on several occasions on video tape
entering the building, checking M.A.’s mailbox, using the elevator
and then exiting
the building several
minutes later. A.A. was not a resident of the building.
 
12.   The Landlord provided a 24-hour written Notice Of
Entry on March 9, 2020 with an entry date for the next day. On March 10, 2020 K.C., a colleague and the superintendent of the building
inspected the unit. They discovered that the unit appeared to be uninhabited by
observing dust collected on the furniture. There were no food items in the
refrigerator or the cupboards. There were no personal belongings or clothing in
the bedroom.
 
13.   As a result, the Landlord cancelled
M.A.’s fob access
in April 2020.
M.A.’s brother continued to
make several further unsuccessful attempts to enter.
 
14.  
On September 21, 2020 the Landlord
requested a meeting with M.A. on October 9, 2020. On October 9th, K.C.. inspected the unit again, after providing
proper notice to M.A.. K.C. observed that the unit was unoccupied and that the
configuration of the unit had not changed since the inspection on March 10th. The unit appeared to be in exactly the same condition as during the previous
inspection in March.




 
15.  
M.A. failed to attend
the meeting, which was scheduled to occur after the inspection. K.C. made several unsuccessful attempts to contact M.A. by
telephone at the time.
 
16.  
Subsequently, on November 6, 2020 K.C. contacted the City of Toronto’s Municipal Licencing and Standards Department, who confirmed there
were no records
of M.A. operating as a taxi
driver in the city.
 
17.   The investigation concluded that M.A. (i) submitted
fraudulent documentation to the Landlord, (ii) was not residing
in the unit, and (iii) does not require the unit. The situation
is particularly concerning because M.A.’s abuse of the system is preventing
other deserving individuals from accessing subsidized housing.
 
18.  
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated as of February
19, 2022. The Tenant shall
give the Landlord vacant possession of the rental unit on or before February
19, 2022.
 
2.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $35,000.00, which
represents additional money the
Tenant would have been required
to pay had the Tenant
not misrepresented the Tenant's
income.
 
3.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
the lawful daily rate for compensation
for the use of the unit from February
9, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before February
19, 2021, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 20, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 19, 2022, then starting February
21, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 21, 2022.
