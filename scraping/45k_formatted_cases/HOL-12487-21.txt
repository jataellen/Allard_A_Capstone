In the matter
of:


820, 20 MINOWAN
MIIKAN LANE TORONTO ON
  M6J0E5


 




Between:


Mehrab Moghadasian
  Mersedeh Safa


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Sire Castillo


Tenant



 
 
Mehrab
Moghadasian and Mersedeh Safa (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy because the Tenant Sire Castillo (the 'Tenant') abandoned
the rental unit.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 1, 2022.
 
The Landlords,
Mehrab Moghadasian and Mersedeh Safa, attended the hearing. As of 12:16 p.m., the Tenant was not
present nor represented at the hearing although properly served with a Notice
of Hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
The Board’s Interpretation Guideline
4: “Abandonment of a Rental Unit” explains
the concept of abandonment as
follows:
 
Abandonment is a
unilateral act by the tenant to relinquish their tenancy and give up possession
of the rental unit without properly giving notice of the termination to the
landlord. If the landlord is not sure whether or not a rental unit has been
abandoned, theymay file an application for determination of this issue with the
Board; however, it should be noted the Board has no jurisdiction to issue an order for rent or compensation
if a tenant is no longer in
possession of the rental unit (see section 87). In this case, the landlord may
seek a remedy by applying to Court.
 
Section 2(3) of the
RTA provides that a rental unit is not considered abandoned where the tenant is
not in arrears of rent. Even if there is evidence of abandonment, such as
thefurniture being removed, the landlord cannot treat the unit as abandoned
before the end of the rental period if the rent is fully paid.

2.   
The uncontested
evidence before me was that the Tenant was in arrears of rent when the
Application was filed on November 2,
2021. The Tenant had been in arrears
of rent since October 2021 as her cheque dated October 1, 2021 was returned
insufficient funds. The Landlords are not holding a last month’s rent deposit.
 
3.   
The Landlords submitted that the
last time they had spoken to the Tenant was on September 22, 2022. They
submitted that on October 14, 2021, they provided the Tenant with a Notice of
Entry for October 15, 2021 for the purpose of an inspection of the rental unit.
The Landlords further submitted that upon inspection of the unit, there were no
personal effects belonging to the Tenant in the unit; the closets were empty,
and garbage was left on the balcony.
 
4.   
I am satisfied,
based on the Landlords’ uncontested evidence, that the Tenant has abandoned the
rental unit.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The tenancy between the Landlord and Tenant is
terminated as of September 30, 2021 as the Tenant has abandoned the rental
unit.
 
2.   
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
3.    If the Tenant does pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before March 8, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 9, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
