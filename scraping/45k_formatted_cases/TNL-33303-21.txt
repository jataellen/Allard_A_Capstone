Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-33303-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


LOWER LEVEL, 48 HARRISON DRIVE NEWMARKET ON L3Y4P4


 




Between:


Daisy Malfara Michael Malfara


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Colleen Subero Jasmine Layden Junior Subero


Tenants



 
 
 
Daisy Malfara and Michael
Malfara (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Colleen Subero, Junior Subero and Jasmine Layden (the 'Tenants')
ecause they have been persistently late in paying their rent. The Landlords also claimed compensation
for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard on January
20, 2022. The Landlords and the Tenant,
Colleen Bubero, attended the
hearing
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have been persistently late paying rent.
 
2.     The Tenants have lived in the rental unit since 2012,
nearly ten years. Due to
circumstances they have been late paying rent but submit
that rent can be paid on time going forward.
 
3.    
Based on the submissions made, I find relief from eviction is appropriate with the
condition set out in this order and explained at the hearing.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord the lawful rent
in full and on time for each consecutive month commencing February 2022 and continuing through
January 2024.
 
2.     In the event the Tenants
fail to make the conditions as set out above, the Landlord shall be entitled to apply to the Board,
no later than 30 days after a breach of this Order,




File Number: TNL-33303-21
 
without notice to the Tenants, for an Order
terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenants, pursuant to Section 78 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006.
