Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-04558-19
 











 
 

H.Z. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict A.C. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on October 2,
2019.
 
The Landlord’s agent, A.L., and
the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from May 1, 2019 to
October 31, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 5, 2019.
2.     
The Tenant made no payments to the Landlord since the application
was filed.
3.     
The arrears owing to October 31,
2019 total $5,500.00. 
4.     
The Landlord is not seeking the
application filing fee. 
5.     
The Landlord seeks a standard,
voidable, eleven-day order. 
TENANT’S EVIDENCE RE: ARREARS AND REQUEST FOR RELIEF
6.     
The Tenant does not dispute the
amount of arrears being claimed by the Landlord. 
7.     
Her evidence was that she is
currently unemployed and cannot pay anything to the Landlord either for arrears
or rent. 
8.     
The Tenant seeks relief from
eviction in the form of a delayed eviction date of November 30, 2019 to make alternative
accommodation arrangements. She testified that she lives in a one-bedroom rental
unit with her five children ages 7, 5, 4, 3 and 1; she has lived in the rental unit
for less than a year and has never been to the Board before. 
9.     
The Tenant testified that her
brother lives upstairs in the three-bedroom unit with his family; I asked her if
she would be able to move in with him, but she was unsure of that possibility. 
10.  
The Landlord opposes the Tenant’s
request to extend eviction to November 30, 2019. He states that the Tenant has made
promises in the past to move out but has failed to follow-through, resulting in
a further accumulation of arrears. 
ANALYSIS
11.  
Based on the evidence before
the Board, I find that the Tenant cannot afford the rental unit; I say this because
she did not submit a request for a repayment plan, did not disclose her household
income (including any benefits received, if any) and is currently not working. 
12.  
Thus, the question before the
Board becomes whether to grant the Tenant’s request for relief. 
13.  
While I can appreciate the Landlord’s
concerns that it has not received any money since May 2019 when the arrears began
to accumulate, the Tenant has no money to pay the Landlord and the fact that this
has been a relatively new tenancy, I find that the Tenant’s family size warrants
some relief in eviction as she has to find a suitable unit for her family of five.

14.  
As the hearing was in October
2019 and the order is being written in January 2020, I find that the Tenant has
had more time than she requested to make the alternative living arrangements and
so a further delay is not warranted. 
15.  
Since the date of the hearing,
the rents for November 2019, December 2019 and January 2020 have also come due.

16.  
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,050.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
17.  
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 1, 2019 to September 5,
2019.
18.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. 
The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before January 18, 2020.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $6,802.82*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to January 7, 2020, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $34.52 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
January 8, 2020 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 18, 2020, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
January 19, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 18, 2020, then starting January 19, 2020, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 19, 2020.
8.     
If, on or before January
18, 2020, the Tenant pays the amount of $8,650.00** to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after January 19, 2020 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
