Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-21180-19
 











 
 

BCHI (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict SB and CB (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe. The Landlord also claimed
administration charges related to NSF cheques.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on January 14,
2020.
 
The Landlord’s representative, CL
and the Tenants’ representative/mother, (IB) attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from October 1,
2019 to January 31, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice
of Termination effective October 25, 2019.
2.     
The monthly rent as of the
date of the hearing is $1,781.50.
3.     
The Landlord incurred
charges of $40.00 for administration charges related to cheques tendered by or
on behalf of the Tenants, which were returned NSF.
4.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,750.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from December 1, 2018 to October 25,
2019.
6.     
There was no dispute that
the Tenants owe the Landlord $7,278.00, which represents the arrears of rent to
January 31, 2020, the administration charges for the NSF cheques, and the
application filing fee.
7.     
The Tenants moved into the
unit in December 2018. 
8.     
IB testified that she is
stepping in to assist her daughters. IB stated that the Tenants are both
employed and have a combined monthly income of over $3,000.00. 
9.     
The Tenants proposed a
payment plan for the arrears and to pay the rent when due. IB stated that she
will help the Tenants with the payments. 
10.  
The Landlord opposed the
payment plan and submitted that the Tenants have not paid any amount towards
the rent since October 2019. The Landlord is concerned that the Tenants and IB
do not have the income to comply with the payment plan.
11.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.  I do not find
that it is reasonable that the Landlord should wait unit March 2020 for the
arrears to be paid, considering that the Tenants had funds and did not pay any
amount towards the rent, not even a token amount. The Tenants are employed and
have not paid the rent in over 4 months. I also considered that the Tenants’ rent
cheques were returned due to NSF. This leads me to conclude that the Tenants
are either unwilling or unable to pay the rent. The Tenants cannot expect the
Landlord to subsidize their living expenses. I also considered that any delay
in terminating the tenancy, means that the arrears will continue to accrue to
over $9,000.00 as the Tenants have not been paying the rent.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before February
2, 2020.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $4,875.26*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to January 22, 2020 and the total charges related to NSF cheques tendered to
the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenants, less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $58.57 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting January 23, 2020 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 2, 2020, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
February 3, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 2, 2020, then starting February 3, 2020, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 3, 2020.
8.     
If the Tenants wish to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $7,278.00 if the payment is made on or before January 31, 2020, or
ii)       $9,059.50 if the payment is made on or before February 2, 2020**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after February 3,
2020 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
