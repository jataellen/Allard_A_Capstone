Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: SWL-54778-21



In the matter
of:


371 FLEMING DRIVE LONDON ON N5V4Y6


 




Between:


JDN Property Management Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Mandela
Bringi


Tenant



 
 
JDN Property
Management Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Mandela Bringi (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed
administration charges related to NSF cheques.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on
December 20, 2021. Only the Landlord’s Agent, John Edlund, attended the
hearing. As of 3:18 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this
hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period
from July 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective September 4, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord
incurred charges of $20.00 for administration charges
related to cheques tendered by or on behalf of the
Tenant, which were returned NSF.
 
3.    
The Tenant
is in possession of the rental unit.
 
4.     The lawful monthly
rent is $450.00.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $450.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 1, 2021 to September 4, 2021.
 
7.     The Tenant paid $1,800.00 after the application was filed.
 
8.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the parties and whether
the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 18, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $127.74*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 7, 2022 and the total charges related to a NSF
cheque tendered to the Landlord
by or on behalf of the Tenant,
less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $14.79
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 8, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
18, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 19, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January
19, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 19, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 18, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $1,106.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain
in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
19, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
