Barbara
Thompson and Douglas Thompson o/a Daniel's Coffee Den (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Rhonda Cadeau (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord has entered
into an agreement of purchase and sale of the rental
unit and the purchaser requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of
residential occupation.
 
This application was heard via video/teleconference on October 19, 2021.
 
Only the Landlords and the Landlord's Legal Representative Allison
Davie attended the hearing.
 
As of 10:40 a.m.,
the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     This is an application under section 49(1)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act).
 
2.     Subsection 49(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2006 (‘the Act’) which states in part:
“a landlord
who has entered into an agreement of purchase and sale (APS) of the residential
complex may, on behalf of the purchaser, give the Tenant of a unit in the
residential complex a notice terminating the tenancy, if the purchaser in good faith requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation
 
3.    
On June 29, 2021 the Landlords
gave the Tenant a (N12)
form notice to end the tenancy because the purchaser required
possession of the rental unit. The termination date in the (N12) notice was August 31, 2021.
 
4.     A copy of the Agreement of Purchase and Sale was
submitted confirming that the Landlords have by agreement sold the property
with a closing of September
1, 2021.

unit for personal
use for a minimum of one year.
 
6.     The Landlords filed a copy of a N11 Agreement
to End the Tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant effective August 31, 2021.
 
7.     The Landlord's Legal Representative affirmed that the

rental unit owned by the Landlords in lieu of the one-month
compensation.
 
8.     The Landlords are seeking an order terminating the tenancy of the rental unit effective August 31, 2021.
