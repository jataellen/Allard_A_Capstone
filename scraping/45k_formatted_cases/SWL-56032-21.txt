In the matter
of:


001, 34 RIDDRELL STREET WOODSTOCK ON
  N4S6M1


 




Between:


Filtec Screens
  Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Nathan Turbill


Tenant



 
 
Filtec Screens
Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order determining that Nathan Turbill
(the 'Tenant') abandoned the
rental unit.
 
This
application was heard via videoconference on January 31, 2022. Only the Landlord’s
legal agents, F. Tang and E. Li, attended the hearing. As of 9:51 a.m., the
Tenant was not present or represented although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord applied for an order determining that the
Tenant abandoned the unit on August 29, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in arrears of rent.
 
3.    
The Landlord’s agents testified
that multiple notices of entry were properly served on the Tenant as they received
notice from the County of Oxford Housing
Support that the Tenant
cannot afford to live in the unit and notice from the Tenant’s emergency
contact that the Tenant may not be returning. When the Landlord’s agents last entered
on August 29, 2021,
there was no garbage, furniture
or clothes left behind but the walls were scratched, and the cabinets and
appliances were dirty. Submitted into evidence were photographs of the emptied unit. The Landlord’s agents had not had any communication with the Tenant
since he last paid rent on July 2, 2021. The Landlord’s agents
spoke to the Tenant’s neighbours and they communicated they had
not seen the Tenant after July 2, 2021.
 
4.    
I
am satisfied the Tenant abandoned
the unit.
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of August 29, 2021, when
the Tenant returned vacant possession to the Landlord.




File Number: SWL-56032-21
 
 
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before March 7, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from March 8, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
