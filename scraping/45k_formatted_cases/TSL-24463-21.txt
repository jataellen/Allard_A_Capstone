Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-24463-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


710,
  15 EVA ROAD ETOBICOKE ON M9C4W3


 




Between:


IMH Pool VIII LP


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Aisha Abdulkadir Logini Alagasegaram


Tenants



 
 
IMH Pool VIII LP (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Logini Alagasegaram and Aisha Abdulkadir (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 12, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative Michelle Forrester attended the hearing. As of 2:36 p.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the
period from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective August 29, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.      The lawful monthly
rent is $2,077.30 effective January
1, 2022.
 
4.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,049.29 from the Tenants
and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
1, 2021 to August 29, 2021.
 
6.     
The Tenants paid $8,302.00
after the application was filed.




 
7.     
The Tenants
state that they have sent a money
order to the Landlord in the amount of $2173.55. This has not been
accounted for in the calculations of this order. This payment, once received,
will void this order.
 
8.      I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord
attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant
and find that it
would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 30, 2022.
 
2.    
As of the date of this order, the amount of the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears
of rent and compensation the
Landlord is entitled to by
$4,544.26*.
 
3.     However, the Landlord
is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenants:
$33.77 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
January 20, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the
unit, and
$186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.     The Landlord or the Tenants
shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a
result of this order.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 30, 2022, then starting
January 31, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 31, 2022.
 
7.     If, on or before January 30, 2022, the Tenants pay the
amount of $2,173.55** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction
will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.




 
8.    
The Tenants may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
31, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
January 19, 2022                                                                                   Date Issued                                                                       Richard

In accordance with section
