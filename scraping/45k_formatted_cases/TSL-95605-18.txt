Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-95605-18
 











 
 
 

A.E (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict B.C and K.C (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe. The
Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges and related administration charges.
 
The Tenants also raised
issues relating to their rights under section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act).
 
This application was heard
in Toronto on June 11, 2018.
 
The
Landlord’s property manager, L.B, and the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
With
respect to the L1 Application:
 
 
3.     
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018. 
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
May 11, 2018.
 
4.     
The Landlord incurred charges of $5.00 for a
cheque tendered by or on behalf of the Tenants, which was returned NSF and
$20.00 for related administration charges.
 
5.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit of
$1,900.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenants for the period from June 1, 2017 to May 11, 2018.
 
7.     
I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
With
respect to the Tenants’ rights under s. 82 of the Act
 
                        Pipe
Under Garage and Cleanup
 
8.     
The Tenants complain that on October 24, 2017 a
pipe under the garage collapsed causing a backup of sewage discharged from the
unit above the rental unit into the basement and the rental unit. It was far
from clear what had caused the collapse of the pipe. Apparently, the City of
Toronto denied responsibility, though at some point in time they had replaced
the pipe connection between the main sewer pipe and the residential complex.
The Tenants said there was sewage in the floors, stairs and walls of the rental
unit. The Tenants said they bought a Shop-Vac wet vacuum and cleaned out the
damaged areas. 
 
 
9.     
The Landlord’s property manager, who is also the
Landlord’s son-in-law in whose house the Landlord lives, said two of the
Landlord’s relatives cleaned up the basement two days after the sewage backup.
He said other than being told there was a little water that leaked into the
kitchen of the rental unit, he had not heard from the Tenants regarding their
unit having a significant cleanup problem until after the Tenants’ rent cheque
for April’s rent was returned for insufficient funds.
 
10.  
The Landlord had a plumber repair the pipe and
presented the plumber’s invoice dated April 19, 2018. The Landlord also
reimbursed the Tenants for the cost of the vacuum cleaner.
 
11.  
I am satisfied that the Landlord responded to
the complaint regarding sewage backup in a timely and reasonable manner. It
appears there was an understanding that the Tenants would clean up the mess
caused by the burst pipe and the Landlord would reimburse them for the cost of
the wet vacuum cleaner, which was done. 
12.  
 
13.  
In addition, the time frame from when the sewage
leakage to when the Landlord was informed of the problem was not established
with sufficient details to allow for a finding that the Landlord had failed to address
the required clean up in a reasonable time. I therefore am not granting a rent
rebate with respect to this complaint.
 
Electrical
 
14.  
The Tenants complained about the lights to the
shared basement being on the rental unit’s breaker panel but they are also
connected to the upstairs unit such that if the upstairs unit turns off the
lights in the basement, the switch in the rental unit cannot turn on the
basement lights whereas if the light switch is left on in the upstairs unit
then the rental unit can control turning the basement lights off and on. It was
not made clear how frequently this was a problem for the Tenants and what they
did to work around it when it occurred. 
 
15.  
The Landlord’s property manager disputed the
Tenant’s claim. He said there are three breaker switches in the basement – one
for each of the three units and the Landlord pays for the cost of electricity
for all three of them and the boiler.
 
16.  
In the absence of better information regarding
the situation with respect to the basement lighting, I am not satisfied this
matter constitutes a breach of the Landlord’s maintenance obligations under
section 20 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 or  justifies a rent
abatement.
 
Toilet Upstairs
Leaking and Bathroom Ceiling
 
17.  
The Tenants said shortly after the occupant of
the upstairs unit moved out, that occupant’s toilet started leaking. They were
not specific about when this began, the extent of the damage, and the notice,
if any, they gave the Landlord with respect to the problem.
 
18.  
The Tenants also stated that there is a hole in
the bathroom ceiling tile and it needs replacing because it has a mouldy smell,
even though the Landlord caused the hole in the ceiling to be fixed.
 
19.  
The Landlord’s property manager said after he
was told about the ceiling in the bathroom he had it fixed. He presented an
invoice from a plumbing company dated May 14, 2018 indicating that the toilet
was removed and the ceiling was opened to locate cause of the leak. The source
of the toilet leak was identified and repaired but the ceiling repair was not
included in that invoice.
 
20.  
The Landlord presented a copy of an e-transfer
for $200 for ceiling repair dated May 27, 2018. It is far from clear to me
whether the ceiling in the bathroom of the rental unit has been repaired. If
not, it should be.  
 
21.  
Accordingly, I find the Landlord has adequately
addressed the maintenance issues raised by the Tenants 
 
Airflow From Doors and
Windows and Heat
 
22.  
The Tenants said there is a 2” gap under the
front door and air flows in from the doors and windows. They said they bought a
space heater.  
 
23.  
The Tenants also said they told the Landlord in
March they had no heat and it took a month for the lack of heat to be fixed.
 
24.  
The Landlord’s property manager said when he was
informed about the windows he arranged to have them cocked and he presented
photographs of the cocking tubes used for that purpose. He said the front door
replacement is on back order. 
 
25.  
The Landlord’s property manager said the
Landlord was notified regarding the problem with heat at the start of April
2018. He presented invoices dated April 17, 2018 and April 19, 2018 for the
cost of installation of a new radiator in the living room and a 7 foot radiator
for the garage. He said when repairs were requested they were done, except that
in the case of the problem with the lack of heat, installation of the radiator
was delayed because parts were backordered.  I am satisfied the Landlord
reasonably addressed the problem with the heat in a timely way after being
informed of the Tenants’ concerns.
 
Dryer Exhaust
 
26.  
The Tenants did not raise the exhaust from the
dryer as a problem however the Landlord’s property manager said he arranged to
have the dryer exhaust flow outside. A photograph of the dryer exhaust hose
leading to the outside of the residential complex was presented.
 
Debris in Driveway
 
27.  
This complaint was difficult to understand. The
Tenants said they had to remove refrigerated debris to avoid attracting pets
however it was not made clear when, if at all, the Landlord was informed of a
problem in this regard. Indeed, the Landlord’s property manager said it was the
tenant in another unit who left garbage out on the driveway. I am not persuaded
the Tenants are entitled to a rent abatement for debris in the driveway, though
the residential complex should be free of garbage.
 
It
is ordered:
 
1.     
The Landlord shall inspect the garage of the
residential complex and remove all garbage located therein by no later than
June 30, 2018.
 
2.     
The Landlord shall inspect the bathroom ceiling
of the rental unit and repair or replace all ceiling tiles that show mould,
water damage or holes by no later than June 30, 2018.
 
3.     
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out
below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The
Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before July 2, 2018.
 
4.     
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$3,241.06*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to
June 21, 2018 and the total charges related to a NSF cheque tendered to the
Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenants, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
5.     
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$62.47 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting June 22, 2018
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
6.     
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
7.     
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before July 2, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe
interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from July 3, 2018 at 3.00%
annually on the balance outstanding.
 
8.     
If the unit is not vacated on or before July 2,
2018, then starting July 3, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
 
9.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord, on or after July 3, 2018.
 
10.  
If the Tenants wish to void this order and
continue the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in
trust:
i)        $5,900.00 if the payment is made on or before June 30, 2018, or
ii)       $7,800.00 if the payment is made on or before July 2, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
11.  
The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after July 3, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
