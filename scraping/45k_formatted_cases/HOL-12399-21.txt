Yongbaihe Gao (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Mike Kolnik and Kerry Alison
Weston (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 1, 2022. The Landlord attended
the hearing. As of 3:39 p.m., the Tenants were not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from October 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective September 18, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $2,000.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,000.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from December
24, 2020 to September 18, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenants paid $10,000.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.     The only amount
outstanding is the Landlord's cost of filing the application. As a result, the order will be limited to costs
only and not eviction.
