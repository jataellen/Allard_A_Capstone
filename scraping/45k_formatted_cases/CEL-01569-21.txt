Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-01569-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


49 LEACREST STREET BRAMPTON ON L6S3K5


 




Between:


Beverley Stephens
  Vivian Stephens


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Sarah Smith Summer Smith


Tenants



 
 
 
Beverley
Stephens and Vivian Stephens (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Summer Smith and Sarah Smith (the 'Tenants')
because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe (L1
application) and because
the Tenants, another
occupant of the rental unit or
someone they permitted in the residential complex have wilfully or negligently
caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlords has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlords
for the damage (L2 application).
 
This application was heard by way of video conference on October 21, 2021. The Landlord
Vivian Stevens and the Tenant Sarah Smith attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
L2 application:
 
1.   
The Landlord’s L2 application is based on an N5 notice
of termination served to the Tenant
on June 13, 2021 with a termination date of June 30, 2021.
 
2.   
The N5 notice was served pursuant
to section 64 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, (the
Act), which states in part:
 
64 (1) A landlord
may give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy
if the conduct of the tenant,
another occupant of the rental unit or a person permitted in the residential
complex by the tenant is such that it substantially interferes with the
reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex for all usual purposes by the
landlord or another tenant or substantially interferes with another lawful
right, privilege or interest of the landlord or another tenant.




 
(2)  
A notice
of termination under subsection (1) shall,
 
(a)    
provide a termination date not earlier
than the 20th day after
the notice is given;
 
3.   
The Landlord’s N5 notice of termination was served with only 17 days’ notice
as opposed to the required
20 days’ notice
pursuant to section 64(2)
(a) of the Act. As the Landlord’s
N5 notice was served less than 20 days before the termination date, I find that
the notice is defective, and the Board does not have
jurisdiction to terminate the tenancy based on the N5 notice.
 
4.   
The Landlord
requested to withdraw
the L2 application and their claim for compensation due to damages. In accordance with subsection 200(4) of
the Act, I consent to the withdrawal of the L2 application.
 
L1 application:
 
5.   
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from December 1, 2020 to October
31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective June 30, 2021.
 
6.   
The Tenants
paid $800.00 after
the application was filed.
 
7.   
The parties
agree as of the date of the hearing that the Tenant
owes to the Landlord
$8,938.06 which
includes $8,737.06 in rent arrears
owing and $201.00
for the costs
of filing the application.
 
Section 82:
 
8.   
Section 82 of the Act states
in part:
 
82 (1) At a hearing of an
application by a landlord under section 69 for an order terminating a tenancy
and evicting a tenant based on a notice of termination under section
59, the Board
shall permit the tenant to raise any issue that could
be the subject of an application made by the tenant under this Act.
 
9.   
At the hearing, the Tenant raised
a number of issues pursuant
to section 82 alleging
that the Landlord has harassed the Tenant, substantially interfered with
her reasonable enjoyment and failed to maintain the rental unit or residential
complex.
 
10. The residential complex
is a semi-detached home consisting of two rental
units. The
Tenant in this application resides on the main floor and upper unit identified as “Unit 1”.
 
11.
The Tenant
moved into the rental unit on or about February
2016. On or about November 2017 the current Landlord
purchased the residential complex and assumed the tenancy.




 
 
 
 
 
Harassment &
Substantial interference:
 
12.
The
Tenant testified that at the commencement of the tenancy, she had exclusive use
of the backyard portion
of the residential complex. The Tenant testified that on or about May 27,
2021 the basement
Tenants began to use the backyard per the Landlord’s permission. The Tenant brought the issues to the Landlord’s
attention on June 8, 2021 and submitted into evidence a number of emails
between her and the Landlord (TT exhibit #1).
The emails confirm that the Tenant has brought the issue to the
Landlord’s attention and that the Landlord had responded stating that both
rental units have equal use of the backyard.
 
13.
On or about June 7, 2021 the Tenant testified that the Landlord
advised her that she is not
allowed to have long term visitors or roommates reside at the rental unit. The Tenant submitted into evidence a
series of emails between her and the Landlord (TT exhibit #2). The Tenant
stated that the Landlord threatened to increase the Tenant’s portion of utility
payments from 70% to 80% if she continues to have guests or occupants who are
not listed on the lease reside in the rental unit. The Tenant testified that the only guest she has on occasion is
her mother who comes over to look after her young child.
 
14.
The
Tenant testified that the Landlord has charged the Tenant an additional $10.00
per month for the water bills due to the Tenant having a swimming pool in the
backyard. The Tenant did not provide
any evidence to support this other than an email and water bill from August 2018 (TT exhibit #3). The swimming pool was subsequently sold
and removed in
the summer of 2020 as per the Landlord’s request.
 
15.
The
Landlord argued that the Tenant’s lease agreement makes no indication that the
Tenant has exclusive use of the backyard
and has provided
no evidence from the prior Landlord confirming this. The Landlord stated that in the absence of
the evidence, he allows both Tenants to access the backyard equally.
 
16.
The
Landlord acknowledges that he told the Tenant he would increase her portion of
the utilities to be paid if the Tenant had additional roommates or long-term
guests. The Landlord argued
that the Tenant
having additional occupants
caused the water
and other utility charges
to increase. The Landlord provided
no evidence to support this allegation.
 
17.
The Landlord
argues that he never told the Tenant
to remove the swimming pool from the backyard of the rental unit. The Landlord stated that the Tenant agreed
to pay additional funds for the water bill as she was using excess water to
refill the pool.




 
Analysis:
 
18.
Sections 22 and 23 of the Act states:
 
22.   A landlord shall not at
any time during a tenant’s occupancy of a rental unit and before the day on
which an order evicting the tenant is executed substantially interfere with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or the residential complex in which it is located for all
usual purposes by a tenant or members of his or her household
 
23.  
A landlord
shall not harass,
obstruct, coerce, threaten, or interfere with a tenant
 
19.
Based
on the evidence before the Board I am satisfied that the Landlord substantially
interfered with the Tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit and
threatened or interfered with the Tenant by telling the Tenant she could not have long term visitors
or guests and by threatening to increase the Tenant’s portion of the
utility payments if individuals who were not on lease were residing in the
rental unit.
 
20.
The
Tenant has the lawful right under the Act to have guests, occupants and
roommates reside in the rental unit without the Landlord’s consent. I find the Landlord’s argument that the
additional roommates and long-term visitors drastically increased the utility
costs to be unsupported by any evidence and unreasonable. I find that the
Tenant is entitled to a rent abatement of $81.00 for this incident. This amount represents a 5% rent abatement for the
month of June 2021.
 
21.
Based
on the evidence before the Board, I am not satisfied on a balance of
probabilities that the Landlord
forced the Tenant to remove
the swimming pool from the backyard of the
residential complex. The Tenant
provided no evidence to support this allegation.
 
22.
I am also not satisfied on a balance
of probabilities that Landlord interfered with the Tenant by not allowing her exclusive use
of the backyard. The Tenant was
unable to provide any lease agreement or correspondence with the original
landlord confirming that the use of the backyard is exclusively for her rental unit. As such,
I find that both rental units have the equal right to use the backyard
space.
 
Maintenance:
 
23.
The
Tenant testified that in June 2021 the upstairs bathroom sink faucet broke and
the Tenant has been without hot water in her upstairs bathroom. The Tenant testified that she has put the Landlord
on notice of the issue immediately in June 2021 and that the Landlord has neglected to repair the issue
to date.




 
24.
The
Tenant testified that since June 2021 her air conditioning unit has not been
working properly. The Tenant
testified that she had to purchase a portable air conditioner. The Tenant submitted into evidence
a number email communications with her and the Landlord (TT exhibit #4).          The
Tenant also submitted into evidence text message communication between her and
the Landlord (TT exhibit #5). In the
test messages dated June 21, 2021 the Tenant included a picture of the
thermostat showing that the temperature in the house was 25 degrees despite the
system being set to cool.
 
25.
The Tenant testified that since 2019 she has had mold in her bathroom room. The Tenant entered into evidence a photo image
showing mold around the edge of the bathtub (TT exhibit #6). The Tenant
testified that the issue has never been rectified and that the Landlord
insisted that it’s her responsibility to fix.
 
26.
The Tenant
testified that the light in the downstairs bathroom has not been working
since 2020. The Tenant did not
advise the Landlord of the issue until June 2021 and the Landlord has not
replaced the light. The Tenant
entered into evidence numerous email communications between her and her
Landlord (TT exhibit #8).
 
27. The Landlord does not dispute that in
June 2021 he was advise that there
was no hot water in the upstairs bathroom
of the rental unit. The Landlord testified that he did not
repair the hot water issues
because the Tenant was in arrears of rent and because he assumed the Tenancy would be
terminated.
 
28.
The Landlord
testified that he has done several inspections of the rental
unit regarding the air conditioning and has not noticed
the air conditioning to be damaged. The
Landlord stated that the basement tenants have complained that the rental unit
was too cold. The Landlord entered
into evidence a copy an inspection report from enercare dated June 16, 2021 (LL
exhibit #1). In review of the report,
the contractor suggests that the air conditioner be replaced.      The Landlord
provided no evidence that the air conditioner has been replaced to date.
 
29.
The Landlord
testified that during his inspections of the rental
unit, he noticed
no mold in the rental unit. The
Landlord also stated that he has not been provided with any information or put
on notice from the Tenant regarding mold.
 
30.
The
Landlord stated that he sent a technician to the rental unit towards the end of
June 2021 to repair the lighting
issue in the bathroom. The Landlord testified
that the Tenant did
not answer the front door and the technician left. The Landlord provided no evidence to support this allegation. Since this attempted inspection, the Landlord has made no effort to return to the rental unit to
replace or repair the lighting in the bathroom. When asked why, the Landlord testified again that it was because
the Tenant was in arrears and because he was intending to terminate the
tenancy.




 
 
 
Analysis:
 
31. Section 20(1) of the Act
states
 
20 (1) A landlord is
responsible for providing and maintaining a residential complex, including the rental units in it, in a good state of repair and fit for habitation and for complying with health, safety, housing and maintenance
standards.
 
32.
Based
on the evidence before the Board, I am satisfied that the Landlord has failed
to maintain to rental unit in a good state of repair. The evidence before the Board indicates that the upstairs
bathroom has no hot water, that the air conditioner is not in working and
requires replacement and that the lighting in the downstairs bathroom is not
working. I do not accept the Landlord’s argument that he did not fix the items because
the Tenant was in
arrears of rent. The Landlord’s
obligation under section 20(1) continues throughout the tenancy and does not cease when a tenant has fallen into
arrears. I also do not accept the Landlord’s evidence that the basement
tenants were complaining that the rental unit was too cold. The Landlord did
not provide any evidence to support this allegation and the basement tenants
were not present to testify at the hearing.
 
33.
For
the maintenance issues, I find that the Tenants should be awarded an abatement
of rent in the amount of $2,073.60. This amount consists
of a 10% rent abatement
from June 2021 to January
2022 for no hot water in the upstairs bathroom which equals to $1,296.00,
a 10% rent abatement from June 2021 to September 2021 for the air conditioner
not working which equals an amount of $648.00 and a 1% abatement from June 2021
to January 2022 for the light in the main floor bathroom not working which
equals to an amount of $129.60.
 
34.
I am
not satisfied that the Tenant is entitled to any rent abatement for their
allegations of mold along the edge of the bathtub.
The Tenant provided
no evidence to support that the
Landlord was put on notice of this issue and I accept the Landlord’s evidence
that they were not advised of the issue.
 
35. The Tenants are entitled to a total abatement of rent of $2,154.60. The Landlord shall
also inspect and repair the maintenance concerns noted in this order.
 
Relief from eviction:
 
36. I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
including the impact
of COVID-19 on the
parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the




 
Tenants and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 28, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b)
of the Act.
 
37. The Tenant advised that she fell into rent
arrears because she was laid off from her job and was out of work from March
2021 to September 2021. The Tenant
proposed a repayment plan that would consist of her paying her monthly rent on
time, plus an additional $200.00 per month. As of the date of the hearing,
the proposed payment
plan would take approximately 3 years and 10 months to pay the arrears
in full.
 
38. The Landlord opposed
the Tenants repayment plan stating that it would prejudicial to the Landlord. The Landlord is a small landlord who
relies on the rental income to pay the mortgage on the rental property.
 
39. I am denying
the Tenant’s requested payment plan, the Tenant has been in arrears of rent
since December 2020 and I find that imposing a 3-year payment plan on the
Landlord would be unfair. I accept
the Landlord’s testimony that he relies on the rental income to pay the
mortgage and other expenses on the rental property.
 
40. I do, however, find a termination date of
February 28, 2022 to be fair to both parties.
The Tenant is provided with some additional time to either pay the
arrears or find alternate housing and the Landlord
is not prejudiced with a delay of 3 years to have the arrears
paid in full.
 
41. This Order contains
all the reasons
for this matter.
No further reasons
will issue.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
On or before February
7, 2022 the Landlord shall inspect and conduct the necessary repairs to the rental
unit. These repairs
include the presence
of mold, no hot water in the upstairs bathroom, no lighting in the
downstairs bathroom and the air conditioning unit.
 
2.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlords $10,807.72*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 17, 2022 and less the amount of the
abatement the Landlords owe the Tenants. The Landlord shall deduct from this
total any additional payments the Tenant made from October 21, 2021.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlords $53.26 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting January 18, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlords $201.00
for the cost of filing
the application.




 
6.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before
February 28, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
7.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
If the Tenants
wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlords or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$11,643.46 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$13,263.46 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not make
full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline,
then the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that
the eviction may be enforced.
The Landlord shall deduct from
this total any additional payments the Tenant made from October 21, 2021.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March 1, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
