File Number: TSL-24162-21



In the matter
of:


BSMT APT, 24 GATWICK AVENUE EAST YORK ON M4C1W3


 




Between:


David Carter


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 


Tenant




 


Shaun
  Montecinos


 



 
 
 
David Carter (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Shaun Montecinos (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021. The Landlord
and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from August 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective August 23, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $975.00.
 
4.     The Tenant paid $2,000.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The
Tenant fell into arrears due to financial assistance he provided his father
during his two months hospitalization. The Tenant intends to pay the complete
arrears by February 14, 2022.
 
6.    
The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $975.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from August 31, 2021
to August 23, 2021.
 
8.    
I have
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19
on the parties and whether the
Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the




File Number: TSL-24162-21
 
Tenant and find that it would not be unfair to postpone
the eviction until February 14, 2022
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. The parties consent to the
termination date as set out in the order below.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before February 14, 2022.
 
2.    
The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,256.33*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to January 11, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $32.05 per day for
compensation for the use of the unit
starting January 12, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the
Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February
14, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 15, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated on or before February 14, 2022, then starting February 15, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
February 15, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$4,026.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$5,001.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 14, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after
February 15, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
