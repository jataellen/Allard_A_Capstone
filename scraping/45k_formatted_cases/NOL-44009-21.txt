Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44009-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


339, 476 LASALLE BOULEVARD SUDBURY ON P3A1W6


 




Between:


Fedmon Rentals Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Christopher Evans


Tenant



 
 
 
Fedmon Rentals
Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Christopher Evans (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord
or another tenant.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 988 4914 7021# on January
10, 2022. The Landlord
Alice Montini, represented by Angid Gravelle, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     Evidence
showing complaints from other tenants
and the Landlord’s testimony, show that
the Tenant and his guests have substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment of other tenants. This conduct includes yelling and
fighting, buzzing other units in the middle of the night to gain access,
causing excessive noise, and harassing
other tenants.
 
2.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $700.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
3.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from January 1, 2019 to
October 4, 2021
 
4.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.




File Number: NOL-44009-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated, as of January
24, 2022. The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before January 24, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$1,595.44, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from October 5, 2021
to January 13, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $23.01 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from January 14, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
January 24, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from January 25, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 24, 2022, then starting January
25, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 25, 2022.
