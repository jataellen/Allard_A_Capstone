In the matter
of:


 
1806, 3 KNIGHTSBRIDGE ROAD BRAMPTON ON L6T3X3


 




Between:


Capreit Limited
Partnership


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Luciano L. Barrantes Pozzo


Tenant



 
 
 
Capreit Limited Partnership (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Luciano
L. Barrantes Pozzo
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 24, 2022. Only the Landlord’s representative, Jason Paine, attended
the hearing. As of 10:17 a.m., the Tenant
was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective January
22, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent is $1,232.83.
 
4.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,218.22 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from November 1, 2020
to January 22, 2022.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $2,500.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the
parties and whether the Landlord
attempted to negotiate
a repayment agreement
with the




 
Tenant, and find that it would
be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 15, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,766.63*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
4, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $40.53
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 5, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
15, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 16, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 15, 2022, then starting
February 16, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 16, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 15, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $5,242.76** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 16, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
