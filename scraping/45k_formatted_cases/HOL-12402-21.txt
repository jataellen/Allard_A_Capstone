In the matter
of:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Chad Kinch


Tenant



 
 
 
1879138
Ontario Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
because Chad Kinch (the 'Tenant') abandoned the rental unit.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 1, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s
Agent, Monica Yang and the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Cynthia Pui Sze
Cheung, attended the hearing. As of
12:04 p.m., the Tenant was not present nor represented at the hearing although
properly served with a Notice of Hearing by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
The Board’s Interpretation Guideline
4: “Abandonment of a Rental Unit” explains
the concept of abandonment as
follows:
 
Abandonment is a
unilateral act by the tenant to relinquish their tenancy and give up possession
of the rental unit without properly giving notice of the termination to the
landlord. If the landlord is not sure whether or not a rental unit has been
abandoned, theymay file an application for determination of this issue with the
Board; however, it should be noted the Board has no jurisdiction to issue an order for rent or compensation
if a tenant is no longer in
possession of the rental unit (see section 87). In this case, the landlord may
seek a remedy by applying to Court.
 
Section 2(3) of the
RTA provides that a rental unit is not considered abandoned where the tenant is
not in arrears of rent. Even if there is evidence of abandonment, such as
thefurniture being removed, the landlord cannot treat the unit as abandoned
before the end of the rental period if the rent is fully paid.

2.   
The uncontested
evidence before me was that the Tenant was in arrears of rent when the
Application was filed on October 23, 2021. The
Tenant had been in arrears of rent since July 2021.
 
3.   
The Landlord’s Legal
Representative submitted that the
Landlord had received an email
from the Tenant stating that he had vacated the unit on January 29, 2021. She further submitted that upon the Landlord’s inspection of the unit,
there were no personal effects
belonging to the Tenant in the unit; only garbage bags were found in the living
room and bedroom.
 
4.   
I am satisfied,
based on the Landlord’s uncontested evidence, that the Tenant has abandoned the
rental unit.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.    The tenancy between
the Landlord and Tenant is terminated as of January
29, 2021 as the
Tenant has abandoned the rental unit.
 
2.   
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.   
If the Tenant does pay the
Landlord the full amount owing on or before March 8, 2022, the Tenant will
start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 9, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
