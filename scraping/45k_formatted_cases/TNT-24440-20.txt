Order under Section 135
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNT-24440-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


3203, 181 WYNFORD DR TORONTO ON M3C0C6


 




Between:


Paul Lee Greendy
Choi


Tenants




 


 
and


 




 


Saeed Sheshehgar


Landlord



 
 
 
Paul Lee and Greendy
Choi (the 'Tenants') applied for an order determining that Saeed
Sheshehgar (the 'Landlord') has collected or retained money illegally.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on August 5, 2021.
 
Only the Tenants attended the
hearing. As of 2:16 p.m., the Landlord was not present or represented at the hearing,
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     SADRUDIN ESMAIL collected money from the Tenants for $300.00
for a key deposit. This amount was never returned
to the Tenants by the Landlord when they returned
the key to the Landlord and vacated the rental unit.
 
2.     SADRUDIN ESMAIL collected
an additional $217.66
per month in 2019 from the Tenants for monthly rent. This is
unlawful under the Act. I find that this amount is unreasonable and excessive.
The rent in 2018 for the rental unit was $2,195.00. The permissible rent
increase for 2019 was 1.8%. The permissible increase for 2019 was $39.51 (1.8%
of
$2,195.00 = $39.51), meaning the
Landlord could have legally charged $2,234.51. However, the Landlord charged
and collected $2,412.66 monthly from the Tenants. The additional monthly
unlawful rent amount
the Landlord charged
to the Tenants is $178.15. The total additional rent the
Landlord charged and collected from the Tenants in 2019 is
$623.53 [$178.15 x 3.5months (September, October, November, and December 2019)]. The unlawful rent increase was
applied on September 15, 2019.
 
3.    
The Landlord collected rent in excess of the amount allowed
by the Act.




File Number: TNT-24440-20
 
4.    
Based on the uncontested evidence provided by the Tenants
at the hearing, I find that the Landlord collected and retained money
illegally that should be paid back to the Tenants.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord shall pay to the Tenants the sum of $623.53. This amount represents the unlawful rent increase of
$178.15 collected from September 15, 2019 to December 31, 2019.
 
2.    
 The Landlord shall also pay to the Tenants
$300.00 for the key
deposit that was never
returned to the Tenants when they returned the key and vacated the rental unit.
 
3.     The Landlord shall also pay to the Tenants $50.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     The total amount
the Landlord owes to the Tenants is $973.53 ($623.53
+ $300.00 +
$50.00).
 
5.     If the Landlord
does not pay the Tenants
the full amount
owing by February
11, 2022, the Landlord will owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 12, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
outstanding balance.
 
6.    
The Tenants have the right, at any time,
to collect the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
