D.D. Acquisition Partnership (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Gavyn Connell-Helle and Meaghan McCann (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did
not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard
by video conference on December
14, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Matt Anderson, attended
the hearing. As of 10:31 a.m. the Tenants were not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from August
1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
August 28, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants vacated the
rental unit on November 24, 2021. The Tenants were in possession of the rental
unit on the date the application was filed.
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,936.00.
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $2,052.66 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit has been paid to the Tenant up to December
31, 2020.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy is
terminated as of November 24, 2021, the date the Tenants gave vacant possession
of the rental unit to the Landlord.

compensation up to November 24, 2021, less the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.

full amount owing* on or before January 16, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
