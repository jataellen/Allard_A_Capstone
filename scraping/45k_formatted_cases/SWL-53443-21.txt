In the matter
of:


3, 1197 BRANTFORD HWY CAMBRIDGE ON N1R5S6


 




Between:


Vang Management


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Daniel Young


Tenant



 
 
 
Vang
Management (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Daniel Young (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
wilfully caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for
an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on January 24, 2022. The Landlord’s legal agents,
A. and N.
Vicentini (AN and NV), and the Landlord’s legal representative, J. Dean,
attended the hearing. As of 10:18 a.m., the Tenant was not present or
represented although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord served an N7 Notice of Termination on July 28, 2021. The N7 Notice alleges
that on various dates, there was water leaking into the units
below the Tenant’s unit. NV’s unit below had water damage to the ceiling
and flooring. It is alleged
that the Tenant wilfully
caused damage to the rental
unit by causing
a leak in the unit and blocking
the Landlord’s access to
repair the issue.
 
2.     On a balance of probabilities, I find that the Tenant
wilfully caused undue damage to the residential complex. The plumber’s invoice
dated July 23, 2021 states the following:
Inspection of
building to determine the cause of significant water damage entering into unit 2 from ceiling in centre of kitchen. Determined through inspection of all above units not to be plumbing related.
All pipes dry, ran water,
no leaks. Cut into ceiling
of unit 2, no plumbing above area of damage. Pipes from above unit drop
into wall behind unit 2 sink. Due to findings it was determined not to be
plumbing/mechanical related.
 
3.    
AV testified that the possible
causes were the Tenant’s dishwasher and leaking toilet as both were observed in
the Tenant’s unit at the time of inspection. AV testified that on one




 
occasion, the plumber noted
wet towels in the bathtub.
The Tenant did not report any leaks from his unit to the Landlord.
 
4.     Based on the plumber’s
report and AV’s testimony, I am satisfied that the damage was as
a result of a leak in the Tenant’s unit. While the existence of leaks alone
does not constitute wilful damage, AV testified
that on a number of occasions, the Tenant called the police when the plumber attended
the unit, thus preventing the plumber’s ability
to investigate and remedy the water leak.
Further, the Tenant
took no reasonable steps to inform
the Landlord and/or prevent
damage. For these reasons, I am satisfied that the Tenant wilfully caused
damage to the rental unit.
 
5.     Having found that the Tenant wilfully caused
damage, the issue remaining is the Landlord’s claim for compensation. The
Landlord submitted into evidence a quote from Dominion Interior Renovations in the amount of $3,051.00
to replace the damaged flooring
and repair the damaged
ceiling. The Landlord
also claimed $542.40
for the plumber
to attend the unit
to check all pipes and fixtures. I find these amounts to be reasonable in the circumstances.
 
SECTION 83 CONSIDERATIONS
 
6.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
7.    
The Landlord did not disclose any
circumstances for me to consider delaying or denying eviction. The Tenant did
not attend the hearing to disclose any circumstances. As such, relief will not
be granted.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
February 28, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$3,593.40, which represents the reasonable costs
of repairing the damage and/or replacing the damaged property.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing on or before February 28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2022, then starting
March 1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction
may be enforced.
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord on or after March 1, 2022. The Sheriff is requested to expedite the
enforcement of this order.
