Jayalakshmi Gundabathula (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Sokha Liv (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on February 3, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Marc Hooper, attended
the hearing. As of 9:42 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from October 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective December 12, 2020.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on March
29, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,200.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of March
29, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$6,694.57*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to March 29, 2021.




File Number: SWL-48628-21
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 22, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 23, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
