Review Order
 
Thomas Muir (the 'Tenant') applied for an order determining that Marc Juneau
(the 'Landlord'), gave a
notice of termination in bad faith.
 
This application was resolved by order SOT-16165-20-AM issued on November
9, 2021. On January 6, 2022,
the Landlord requested a review of the order.
A preliminary review of the review
request was completed without a hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord’s request
to review claims
that there is a serious
error in the hearing order.
 
2.    
In particular, the Landlord
asserts that there
is a serious error in how the hearing Members calculated the rent
differential awarded under paragraph 57(3)1 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).
 
3.    
The information provided with the
Landlord’s request to review explains the alleged serious error as follows.
The Landlord entered
into a tenancy agreement with the Tenant on May 14, 2017. The Tenant is the
only tenant party to this agreement. The Tenant entered into a new tenancy
agreement dated June 17, 2020 with the Tenant’s new landlords. This new
agreement names both the Tenant and Ms. Cailyn Muir as tenant parties and specifies a monthly rent of $1,550.00. It is the Landlord’s submission that the Tenant’s new rent is half of
$1,550.00 or $775.00 because there are two tenant parties. The Landlord claims
that the Board’s calculation of the rent differential is therefore incorrect
and ought to be reduced.
 
4.     There is in my view no arguable
merit to the Landlord’s claim
for the following reasons.




File Number: SOT-16165-20
 
5.    
As noted in Board Interpretation Guideline
21, Landlords, Tenants,
Occupants and Residential
Tenancies:
 
Where two or more persons are
tenants of a rental unit, it is important to consider the nature of their
relationship with the landlord to determine if the tenants are joint tenants,
tenants in common, or, as in the case of a rooming house, they have separate and distinct tenancy
agreements with the landlord and live separately from one another.
 
In a joint tenancy, there is a
single tenancy agreement and the tenants are jointly and severally (individually) liable
for the payment
of the entire rent for the rental
unit.
 
6.     It is clear from the June 17, 2020 tenancy agreement
that the Tenant and Ms. Muir are joint tenants. Both are named as tenants
on the agreement and both tenants are equally
responsible for the monthly rent of $1,550.00. This means that the
Tenant is individually liable for the entire new monthly rent of $1,550.00
despite the fact that there are two tenant parties
to the new tenancy agreement. In these circumstances, the Tenant’s
new rent is $1,550.00 not $775.00 and the hearing Members correctly
calculated the rent differential.
 
7.     For the reasons
expressed above, I am not satisfied that there is a serious
error in the order or that a serious error
occurred in the proceedings.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The request to review order SOT-16165-20-AM issued
on November 9, 2021
is denied. The order is confirmed and
remains unchanged
