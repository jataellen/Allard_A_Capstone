John Gault


Tenant



 
 
 
Westcan Income
Lp2 (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict John Gault (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes; and because the Tenant,
another occupant of the rental unit or someone he permitted in the residential
complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on November 1, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Tim Currie, attended
the hearing. As of 11:12
a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
November 1, 2015 to June 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective June 1,
2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $414.16.
 
4.     The Tenant paid $2,000.00 after
the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
sold the property
on July 1, 2021. Accordingly, this order is for arrears
and costs only and not eviction.
 
It is
ordered that:




File Number: SWL-53764-21
 
1.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$868.98*, which represents the amount of rent
owing up to June 30, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
17, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 18, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
