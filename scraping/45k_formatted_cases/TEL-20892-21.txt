Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-20892-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


LOWER, 1014 RENAISSANCE DRIVE OSHAWA ON L1J8B1


 




Between:


Jaclyn Cameron
  Lincoln Hall


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Gage Corson
  Tia Deering


Tenants



 
 
 
On November 8, 2021, Jaclyn Cameron
and Lincoln Hall (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Gage
Corson and Tia Deering (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants entered into an
agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlords and the Tenants
signed an agreement
to terminate the tenancy as of
December 31, 2021.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenants to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 17, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January
18, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.




File Number: TEL-20892-21
 
 
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after January 18, 2022.

The tenant has until January 16, 2022 to file a motion with the Board

under
s. 77(6) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 16, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on July 18, 2022 if
the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
