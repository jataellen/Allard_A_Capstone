File Number: SOL-26660-21
In the matter of:      306, 195 WELLINGTON STREET SOUTH
HAMILTON ON L8N2R7
 
Between:                  Medallion                                    Landlord

Paige Lee Gray Trevor Gray


Tenants




 
On November 24, 2021,Medallion (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Trevor Gray and Paige Lee Gray (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants
pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the Board on September 21, 2021 with respect to
application SOL-21278-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenants have not met the following condition(s) specified in the order:
 
The Tenants failed
to pay to the Landlord
$1,664.90 on or before November
1, 2021 towards arrears of
rent. This was a breach of the
previous order.
 
3.       
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenants were ordered
to pay $4,994.72 for rent arrears in Order SOL-21278-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $4,994.72 and
that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order
SOL-21278-21 is cancelled.
 
5.       
Since the date of the order,
the Tenants have also failed to
pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from October 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.
 
6.       
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $843.15 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenants for the period from February 1, 2021
to January 17, 2022.




File Number: SOL-26660-21
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.       
Order SOL-21278-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move
out of the rental
unit on or before
January 28, 2022 (standard 11 days from the
issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $5,837.40*. This amount represents the rent owing up to November 30, 2021, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$27.72 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting December 1, 2021 to the date the Tenants actually move out of the
rental unit or get evicted.
 
5.       
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
28, 2022, the Tenants will
start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 29, 2022.
 
 
January 17, 2022

The tenant has until January 27, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 27, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on July 29, 2022 if the order has not been

has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
