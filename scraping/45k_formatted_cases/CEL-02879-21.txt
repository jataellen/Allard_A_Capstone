Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006

In the matter
of:


BASEMENT, 9 FALSTAFF DRIVE BRAMPTON ON L6Y5J7


 




Between:


Sukhwinder Nagra


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Gurvir Brar Narinder Brar


Tenants



 
 
 
Sukhwinder Nagra (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Narinder Brar and Gurvir
Brar (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord
requires possession of the
rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard by video conference January
27, 2022.
 
The Landlord attended the hearing.
The Tenants did not attend
the hearing despite
being served notice of this
hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application is based on a Notice
of Termination (‘N12’)
which the Landlord seeks residential occupancy of the rental unit.
 
2.    
The N12 was served
on the Tenants on September
21, 2021, with a termination date of November 30,
2021. The N12 indicates the Landlord’s child intends to move into the rental
unit and occupy it for it least one year.
 
3.      Section 72(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”)
prohibits the Board
from ordering a “personal use” eviction if the landlord has not filed a
declaration from the person who requires the unit certifying that they require
it in good faith for at least one year. Moreover, s. 55.1 requires a landlord
seeking a personal use eviction to pay one month’s compensation to the tenant
before the proposed termination date. In this case the Landlord failed to
satisfy both requirements.
 
4.     The Landlord failed to pay the required compensation
to the Tenants prior to the termination date specified in the N12. The
Landlord testified that the Tenants
have not paid rent in three
months and so he gave them a rent credit. While a rent credit can indeed
constitute compensation within the meaning of s. 48.1, in my view for it to be




File Number: CEL-02879-21
 
considered compensation, a
landlord must at a minimum communicate that a credit is being given as such. I
am not satisfied that the Tenants were made aware of the rent credit prior to the termination date. As a result, the Landlord has not satisfied s.55(1) of the Act. This application will be dismissed on that basis.
 
5.    
I would note that
the affidavit that accompanied the application was sworn by the Landlord, and not his children.
The Landlord stated that he did not think
it appropriate for his children to swear an affidavit
because they are minors. The Act requires that a declaration be filed by the
person that requires the unit. Because the Landlord failed to pay the required
compensation, I do not need to decide whether a landlord who wishes the unit
for the purposes of residential occupation by their minor children falls within
the meaning of s. 48, or whether due to the minor status of the children the real substance of the application is the Landlord’s own use. I further do not
need to decide whether, assuming a minor can be a person within the meaning s.
48(1)(c), those children would be required to swear an affidavit despite being
minors. The Landlord may wish to consider these issues if they intend to
refile.
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
