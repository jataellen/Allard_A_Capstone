Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-97671-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


448 KING
GEORGE STREET OTTAWA ON
  K1K1T3


 




Between:


Ottawa Community Housing


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Naseema Naveed Ozair Naveed Waheedullah Naveed


Tenants



 
 
 
Ottawa Community Housing (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Naseema Naveed, Ozair Naveed and Waheedullah Naveed (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on January 11, 2022. Only the Landlord’s representative, B. Cumming, attended
the hearing. Determinations:
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from April 1, 2020, to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October 29, 2020.
 
2.    
The Tenants paid $6,000.00
after the application was filed.
 
3.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including the impact of the pandemic and whether the
Landlord attempted to negotiate a payment plan, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 5, 2022.




File Number: EAL-97671-21
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $19,678.94*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 22, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $37.08
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 23,
2022, to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before March 5, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from March 6,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 5, 2022, then starting
March 6, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 6, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$20,530.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022,
or
ii)             
$21,683.00 if the payment
is made on or before
March 5, 2022**.
If the Tenants
do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after March 6, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once
during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
