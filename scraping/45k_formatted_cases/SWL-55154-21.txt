Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55154-21
 
 
In the matter of:      26, 70 SUNNYSIDE DRIVE
LONDON ON N5X3W4
 
Between:                  Conrad Aleong                                    Landlord
 
 
and
 




Jocelyn Vanbree Mardie Vanbree


Tenants




 
 
 
Conrad Aleong (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jocelyn Vanbree and
Mardie Vanbree (the 'Tenants') because they or another occupant
of the rental unit have
committed an illegal act or have carried out, or permitted someone to carry out
an illegal trade, business or occupation in the rental unit or the residential
complex; and because the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for
the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation
for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on January 21, 2022.
 
The Landlord, Conrad Aleong,
the Landord’s legal representative, L. Lux, the Tenant, Mardie Vanbree, and the tenant’s legal
representative, J. Aitken attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
N6 Notice
 
1.       
At the hearing, the landlord’s
legal representative, L. Lux requested to withdraw the matter in part regarding
the N6 Notice to Evict for Illegal Acts. In accordance with subsection 200(4)
of the Act, I consent
to the withdrawal of that part of the application.
 
2.       
There was no evidence
or submissions presented
at the hearing regarding the N6 notice.
 
N12 Notice
 
3.       
The Landlord is the owner of the rental unit in this application. The Landlord does not
own any other unit.




 
4.       
On September 21, 2021, the
Landlord served the Tenant with an N12 Notice with a termination date of November
30, 2021 because
the Landlord requires
the unit for his
own use.
 
5.       
At the hearing, the Landlord
testified that he provided the Tenant with compensation equal to one month’s
rent in the amount of $1560.00
in the form of a cheque dated for November 30, 2021. The Tenant’s representative confirmed at
the hearing that the cheque is being held at his office on behalf of the
Tenant.
 
6.       
The Landlord testified that he
returned to Canada from Trinidad in October 2021 as a permanent resident. He testified that he is still on the Board of Directors
for 2 companies, but he is not required to be in Trinidad for his role
because they work remotely via Zoom and other forms of virtual platforms.
 
7.       
The Landlord has been staying with his sister since October
2021 while he waits
to move back into his unit. He
is currently using a space that is normally used as an office for a bedroom.
 
8.       
The Landlord testified that the
Tenant has been residing in the unit for over 9 years. The Landlord testified
that once he has vacant possession of his unit, he intends to take
approximately one month to paint the unit and update the carpets before he
moves in. He noted that the unit has
not been painted in over 9 years. I
find that the Landlord would move in within a reasonable timeframe
if he took one month to give the unit a fresh coat of paint and change some
carpets.
 
9.       
The Landlord testified that the unit will be his permanent residence for a period of at least one year.
 
10.  
At the hearing, the Tenant’s legal
representative argued that the wrong Notice was provided to the Tenant and that an N13 Notice was required
because the Landlord wants to repair the unit. I am not satisfied that the N13 Notice would
be more appropriate to this application simply because the
Landlord indicated that he wanted to update the unit prior to moving in.
 
11.   The Tenant testified that in June of 2021,
the Landlord or Landlord’s property
agent tried to enter into an agreement by offering the Tenant a month’s worth of free rent in order for him to vacate the unit. The Tenant
said that he originally agreed with the Landlord to accept a month’s free rent
in exchange for vacant possession of the rental unit but was later informed by
a friend that he should not sign anything before going to the Landlord and
Tenant Board. The Tenant’s position is that this previous action by the
Landlord shows that the Landlord is attempting to act in bad faith. While I accept that this previous
interaction happened, I do not find it has any bearing on whether the Landlord
intends to reside in the unit pursuant to this application.
 
12.   Based on the evidence presented to me at the hearing,
I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities
that the Landlord
in good faith requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.




 
 
 
13.  
At the hearing, the Tenant said
that if he is required to move, he would like an additional three months
to try to find a new place to live.
The Tenant indicated
that there are limited
units available and that the rent amounts have increased significantly in the
area.
 
14.   The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,400.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
15.   Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from October 1, 2012 to March 31, 2022.
 
16.   I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until March 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the
Tenants is terminated, as of March 31, 2022.
The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before March 31, 2022.
 
2.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$51.29 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
from April 1, 2022 to the date they move out of the unit.
 
3.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 31, 2022, then starting April 1, 2022,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
4.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after April 1, 2022.
