Arlette Utton (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jamie Mete
and Donna Escobar (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 24, 2022. Only the Landlord
and their Legal
Representative, Lawrence Pomfret, attended the hearing. As of 10:09 a.m., the
Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period
from January 1, 2020 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective September 24, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on November
30, 2021. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,510.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of November
30, 2021, the date the Tenants returned vacant possession of the rental
unit to the Landlord.




File Number: CEL-03087-21
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $6,384.63*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to November 30, 2021.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
19, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 20, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
