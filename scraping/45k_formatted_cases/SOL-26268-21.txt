Order under Section 68
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26268-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


2, 38 ST. MATTHEW'S AVENUE HAMILTON ON L8L5P3


 




Between:


Tom Dudek


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Felicia Jacobs Leanne Blacklock


Tenants



 
 
Tom Dudek (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Leanne Blacklock and Felicia Jacobs
(the 'Tenants') because
they, another occupant
of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the
residential complex have substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit
after the termination date.
 
This application was heard
in Passcode: 956 0593 7653# on February
9, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord and the Landlord’s Representative, Sara Atkinson
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1. The N5 Notice of
Termination the Landlord filed is invalid because it does not identify
the rental unit as required under
section 43 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). The Board has no authority to
terminate a tenancy when a Notice is void.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The application is
dismissed.
