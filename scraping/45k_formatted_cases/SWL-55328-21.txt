Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Charlene Smith


Tenant



 
 
London & Middlesex Community
Housing (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Charlene
Smith (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 13, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Tanya Murray, attended the hearing. As of 10:44 a.m., the Tenant
was not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from December 1, 2019 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective March 9, 2020.
 
2.    
The Tenant
vacated the rental
unit on January 4, 2022. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $930.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $554.00 from the
Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021 to March 9, 2020.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of January
4, 2022, the date the Tenant returned
vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.




File Number: SWL-55328-21
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $3,810.70*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January
4, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
2, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 3, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
