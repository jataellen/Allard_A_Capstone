2193958
Ontario Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy of
Dhanajan Kasipillai (the 'Tenant'), and to evict the unauthorized occupant and
for compensation for the use of the rental unit.
 
This
application was heard via videoconference on January 10, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s legal agent, L. Macdonald, and the Landlord’s legal representative, C. Corsetti, attended
the hearing. As of 11:00 a.m., neither the Tenant nor
the unauthorized occupant was present or represented although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant transferred
the occupancy of the rental unit to
‘Current Occupant’ (hereinafter
called the 'Unauthorized Occupant') in a manner
that was not authorized by the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'). The Landlord did not enter into a tenancy agreement with this
person.
 
2.    
The lawful monthly rent was $875.00.
 
3.     The Landlord was first aware of the Unauthorized
Occupant in the rental unit on June 26, 2021 when the Unauthorized Occupant
requested maintenance in the unit and the Landlord’s agent did not recognize
the person making the request. This application was subsequently filed on July
23, 2021.
 
4.     Based on the uncontested evidence of the Landlord, I
find the Unauthorized Occupant vacated the unit on December 10, 2021. The
Unauthorized Occupant was in possession of the rental unit on the date the
application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord is entitled to compensation for the use
and occupation of the rental unit by the Unauthorized Occupant.




File Number: SWL-53747-21
 
6.    
The Landlord received compensation
for the use of the unit to September 30, 2021. However, no compensation was
received from October 1, 2021 to December 10, 2021.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated as of June 26, 2021.
 
2.     The Unauthorized Occupant shall pay to the Landlord
$2,013.90, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from October
1, 2021 to December 10, 2021.
 
3.     The Unauthorized Occupant shall also pay the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     The Unauthorized Occupant shall pay the Landlord the
full amount owing by February 7, 2022.
 
5.     If the Unauthorized Occupant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing by February
7, 2022 they will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February
8, 2022 at 2.00% on the
outstanding balance.
