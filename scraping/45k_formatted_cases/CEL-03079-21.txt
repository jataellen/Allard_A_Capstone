Tenants




 
 
Capreit Limited
Partnership (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Valbert Ezekiel Buchanan
and Deatrice Lashone
Buchanan (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard by videoconference on January 24, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Gabriela Quaresma, attended the hearing.
As of 10:00 a.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice
of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 23, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants vacated the rental unit on November
30, 2021. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $2,023.56.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $2,023.56
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from October
1, 2020 to September 23, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of November
30, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.




File Number: CEL-03079-21
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $4,652.21*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to November
30, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before March 31, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from April 1, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
