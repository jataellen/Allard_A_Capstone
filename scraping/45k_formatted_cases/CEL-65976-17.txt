Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-65976-17
 










 
 

JC
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict GS
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
(L1 application)
 
This
application was heard in Barrie on May 8, 2017.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from January 1, 2017 to May 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective March 17, 2017.
2.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $550.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
3.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from October 1, 2016
to March 17, 2017.
Issue
Regarding the Arrears Owing
4.      The
Tenant agreed that she did not pay any rent to the Landlord from January 1,
2017 to the date of this hearing.  The Tenant testified that she instead paid a
first and last month’s deposit on another unit in another location, as she
wanted to move out of the rental unit.  The Tenant was unable to produce any
receipt, copy of another lease or any other document to evidence that she made
a first and last month’s deposit elsewhere.
5.      The
Tenant, however, disputed the amount of rent arrears for the month of January
2017. She testified that a payment of $550.00 that she made is missing from the
Landlord’s application and argued the receipts the Landlord regularly issues are
purposefully confusing and misleading.
6.      Specifically,
the Tenant testified that on or about December 1, 2016, she paid the Landlord
$550.00 for the rent period of December 1-31, 2016, and then paid an additional
$750.00 on or about December 21, 2016 to pre-pay the rent for January 2017,
plus an additional $200.00 because she planned to move out of the rental unit
shortly thereafter.
7.      The
Landlord denied ever receiving any rent on or about December 1, 2016, but did
confirm that he received $750.00 from the Tenant on or about December 21,
2016.  The Landlord testified the $750.00 was a late payment for the rent due
on December 1, 2016, plus an additional $200.00 which he credited to the
Tenant’s account for the month of January 2017.  The Landlord affirmed this
$200.00 credit was clearly shown in the N4 notice of arrears to the Tenant, as
well as being reflected in the L1 application.
8.      The
Landlord submitted copies of rent receipts for November 2016 (LL#1), December
2016 (LL#2) and January 2017 (LL#3).
9.      I
note the three rent receipts are the kind of basic receipts that can be
purchased from any retail store, so they have no numerical chronology to show
they indeed succeed one another, and only contain the dates and dollar
information that have been handwritten onto them by the Landlord.  As well, the
Landlord handwrites account information on the back of the receipts to include:
the amount of due for the particular month, the date(s) when the Tenant pays,
the dollar amount of those payment(s), and the balance owing.
10.   The
Landlord testified that these three receipts represent the true state of the
Tenant’s rent payments and account for the months of November and December 2016
and January 2017. 
11.   The
Tenant testified she receives ODSP payments toward the end of every month, and
that once those payments are received, she withdraws money and pays the
Landlord the upcoming monthly rent, always in cash.  The Tenant testified that
on or about December 1, 2016, she met the Landlord when he was “doing some
plumbing” in the basement of the building and paid him $550.00.
12.   Again,
the Landlord denied this December 1st payment ever happened.
13.   The
Tenant did not bring any evidence to corroborate her testimony.  In an attempt
to give the Tenant a chance to produce some supporting documentation, I held
down the hearing for 30 minutes so the Tenant could go to the bank to get
account information for the months of November 2016 to January 2017 inclusive.
14.   The
Tenant returned and submitted a copy of her bank statements for the four months
of October 2016 to January 2017 (exhibit TT#1).
15.   The
Tenant pointed to her ODSP payment on November 30, 2016, and a withdrawal from
her account on the same date.  The Tenant testified that TT#1 evidences her
usual pattern of withdrawing cash at the end of each month to pay the upcoming
monthly rent.  She testified that this pattern should support her testimony
that she paid an additional $550.00 in December 2016.
16.   The
Landlord also referred to a past L1 application for this tenancy that was heard
and successfully disposed of by a payment plan in the fall of 2016.  The
Landlord mentioned this as part of his argument that notwithstanding the ODSP
monthly payments, the Tenant did fall into rent arrears in the past.  The
Tenant confirmed that she successfully met the previous payment plan stemming
from a previous L1 application in the fall of 2016.
17.   I
note the contradicting testimonies of the parties regarding the alleged $550.00
rent payment on or about December 1, 2016, and so I must determine which
evidence is the better evidence.
18.   The
Landlord’s evidence (LL#1 to LL#3) appears to be quite consistent from receipt
to receipt, and I was able to follow his handwritten accounting information
well enough.
19.   The
Tenant’s evidence (TT#1) does show a pattern of ODSP payments toward the end of
each month, and does show the Tenant withdraws different amounts of money right
after receipt of each monthly ODSP payment.  However, I am not able to make any
connection between the money she withdraws and any rent payment she has made, or
claims to have made.  
20.   I
do note that on January 31, 2017, ODSP deposited money into the Tenant’s
account and the Tenant did withdraw a sum of month on the same day.  However,
the Tenant did confirm that she made no rent payments at all from January 1, 2017
to the date of this hearing.  
21.   Taking
this failure to pay any rent in January 2017 suggests to me that the Tenant
does not always pay her rent right after ODSP deposits money into her account. 
I note the Tenant testified that she paid a first and last month’s rent deposit
for some other unit elsewhere, but I must look to the fact that she was unable
to produce any evidence to support her claim in this regard.
22.   Based
on a balance of probabilities and taking the better evidence before me, I am
unable to find in favour of the Tenant’s claim that she paid $550.00 to the
Landlord on or about December 1, 2016.  As such, I find in favour of the
Landlord and his L1 application as presented.
23.   The
Tenant testified that she notified the Landlord sometime in March 2017, orally,
that she had planned to move out of the rental unit by May 31, 2017 but that
when the Landlord presented her with an N11 form to sign, that she refused to
sign it.
24.   The
Landlord requested that a standard voidable order be issued, whereas the Tenant
asked for an order giving her to end of this month so she could try to pay her
arrears in full.
25.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find
that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until May 31, 2017
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before May 31, 2017.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,666.08*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to May 12, 2017, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $18.08 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting May 13, 2017 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May
23, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from May 24, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before May 31, 2017, then starting June 1, 2017,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 1, 2017.
8.      If,
on or before May 31, 2017, the Tenant pays the amount of $2,740.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after June 1, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
