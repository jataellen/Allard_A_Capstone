Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-21215-21
 



In the matter
of:


3, 12 1/2
LINDSAY STREET NORTH LINDSAY ON K9V1T4


 




Between:


Kawartha Construction Company Limited


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Crystal
Montague


Tenant



 
 
Kawartha
Construction Company Limited (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Crystal Montague (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have
the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant
owes because the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified in the order
issued by the Board on December 1, 2021 with respect to application
TSL-18933-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant
has not met the following conditions specified in the order: the Tenant did not pay $233.00 on or before December 1, 2021, nor did they pay the lawful
rent for December also due on or before December 1, 2021.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $7,845.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
TSL-18933-21. The amount
that is still owing from that
order is $7,845.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order TSL-18933-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed
to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from December 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The previous
order TSL-18933-21 is cancelled.

2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 24, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$8,602.00*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to December 31, 2021 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $25.22
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
24, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 25, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 24, 2022, then starting January
25, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 25, 2022.

The tenant has until January 24, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 24, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on July 25, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before
this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial
jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
