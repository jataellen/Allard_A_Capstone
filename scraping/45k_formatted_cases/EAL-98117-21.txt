Tenants



 
Rocco And Domenic Cambareri (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Justin Harris and Krystal Mason
(the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 25, 2022. The Landlord’s Legal Representative, Allan
Kouri, and the Tenant, Justin Harris, attended the hearing. Krystal Mason was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period
from January 1, 2021 to October
31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective October 2, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on September
30, 2021. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $865.00.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $850.00
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from April 1, 2017 to October 2, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of September 30, 2021, the date the Tenants gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.




File Number: EAL-98117-21
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $1,846.29*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to September 30, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
11, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 12, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
