Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19422-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


301, 1705 MCCOWAN ROAD SCARBOROUGH ON M1S4L2


 




Between:


Regina Yogaraja


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Arielle
Wellington


Tenant



 
 
 
Regina Yogaraja (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Arielle Wellington (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did
not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 20, 2021. Only the Only the Landlord's Agent,
Nishanthiny Robinson Neil attended the hearing. As of 2:41 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice
of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      
The Tenant was in possession of the rental
unit on the date the application was filed.
 
2.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from August 5,
2021 to December 31, 2021.
 
3.    
The Tenant made no payments after the application was filed.
 
4.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,900.00.
 
5.    
The Landlord
is not holding a last month’s rent
deposit.
 
N4 Notice
 
6.     At the hearing a preliminary issue arose with respect to the validity
of the N4 Notice of
Termination (‘N4 notice’). This relates to the rental period ending date
claimed on the N4 notice.




 
7.     The general requirements for a valid notice of termination are set out in section
43 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). One requirement is that the notice “shall
set out the reasons
and details respecting the termination”. The specific requirements for an N4 notice are
set out in section 43(2) of the Act,
one of which is to “set out the reasons and details respecting the termination”. The notice of
termination included the incorrect rental period dates.
 
8.     The Landlord testified
that the rent is due on the 5th of each month therefore the rental
period ends on the 4th of each month. The notice of termination shows the
rental period starts and ends on the 5th of each month.
 
9.     The Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”) at section 59(2) requires particular
contents of an N4 Notice of Termination, which includes the requirement that
the amount of rent shall be specified. Given the error contained in the N4
Notice of Termination, the period of rent arrears claimed
is ambiguous and does not properly reflect
the exact periods of monthly rent that are being alleged. Since the N4 Notice did not properly
give the Tenant the opportunity to understand what
specific periods of alleged rent arrears were being claimed, the N4 Notice is
rendered invalid.
 
Amending L1 Application to L9 Application for Arrears and Costs Only
 
10.  As a result of the defects with the
N4 Notice, the options were explained to the Landlord including the possibility of requesting consent
to withdraw this L1 Application to correct the N4 Notice, which may lead to filing a
new L1 Application if he wished to pursue eviction based on these periods of
rent arrears. The Landlord requested
to amend this application to an L9 application for arrears only, without seeking
eviction. I consented
to the request to seek only
arrears. The Landlord was aware that the Board’s order on an L9 application
would be only for arrears, which would have to
be enforced in another jurisdiction such as small claims
court upon any breach.
 
11.  The
issue of amending
an application was raised in the case Nejad v Preddie, 2016 ONSC
4348 (CanLII), where
the Divisional Court upheld a Board decision
allowing an application to proceed to collect arrears
despite a defective N4 notice.
 
12.  Further, section 201(1)(f) of the Act
permits the Board to amend an application during a hearing, if the Board considers it appropriate to do so and if amending the application would not be unfair to any party. I
consented to the request to amend the application as there is no prejudice or unfairness to the Tenant
since the N4 notice contemplates that arrears may be sought.




 
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$7,600.00, which represents the amount of rent
owing up to December 31, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before January
24, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 25, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
