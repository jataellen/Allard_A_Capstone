Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 











 
 

LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict AC (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges (L1
Application).
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant has been persistently late
in paying the Tenant's rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each
day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date (L2
Application).
 
This application was heard in Mississauga on May 24,
2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Regarding L1 rent owing
application
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from April 1, 2018 to
May 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective April 23, 2018.
2.     
The Landlord incurred
charges of $7.00 for cheques tendered by or on behalf of the Tenant, which were
returned NSF.
3.     
The Tenant does not dispute
the amount of rent owing or the NSF cheque.
Section 82 - harassment
4.     
At the hearing the Tenant
raised issues pursuant to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2006 (the 'Act').  
5.     
He testified that the
Landlord harassed him by threatening eviction because she believed he was
smoking marijuana in the unit.  The Tenant played a recording of a conversation
which occurred between the parties on March 29, 2018.  The Landlord could be
heard accusing the Tenant of using drugs and having guests who are engaging in
drug deals.
6.     
The Landlord does not deny
the conversation.  She sought to present evidence from two witnesses regarding
the Tenant’s conduct.  I did not allow the Landlord to present evidence from
her witnesses because the evidence is related to the Tenant’s conduct which is
not an issue properly before me in these applications.  The issue to be
determined in this application is whether the conduct of the Landlord amounted
to harassment of the Tenant.
7.     
Section 23 of the Act
specifies that a landlord shall not harass, obstruct, coerce, threaten or
interfere with a tenant.
8.     
Section 22 of the Act
provides that a landlord shall not substantially interfere with the reasonable
enjoyment of the rental unit for all usual purposes by a tenant.
9.     
There is insufficient
evidence to support a finding of either harassment or substantial
interference.  This was a single incident and the discussion became heated
between the parties.  It was unnecessary for the Landlord to accuse the Tenant
of using and/or dealing drugs because the Landlord is able to provide the
Tenant with the proper notice for such alleged conduct. However such a single
incident does not meet the definition of harassment and does not amount to
substantial interference. The Tenant is incorrect in his testimony that by
serving him with an N8 notice, the Landlord threatened eviction.  The N8 notice
is on an authorized Board form and clearly informs the Tenant about his rights
to a hearing and that he does not have to move out if he disagrees with the
notice.
10.  
This claim is dismissed.
Regarding L2 persistent late rent application
11.  
On March 31, 2018 the
Landlord gave the Tenant an N8 notice of termination pursuant to subsection
58(1)(1) of the Act.  The notice is effective May 31, 2018 and alleges that the
Tenant persistently paid rent late. 
12.  
The Tenant persistently paid
rent late. Rent is due on the first day of each month. The Tenant paid rent
late seven times out of the last nine months.  The Landlord submitted her bank
statements to support the late rent payments claimed.  The Tenant does not
dispute the late rent payments.
13.  
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,100.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
14.  
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from October 22, 2015 to April 23, 2018.
Relief from eviction
15.  
The Landlord seeks final
termination of the tenancy.  She expressed emotional and financial distress
because the unpaid and late rent payments impede her ability to pay her
mortgage.  Some of her distress is related to the alleged conduct of the Tenant
and his guests.
16.  
The Tenant has shared
custody of his three year old child. He has lived in the unit for approximately
three years.  He can pay the rent arrears 11 days after the order issue date. 
He also said he can comply with an order requiring him to pay rent when it
becomes due for a twelve month period because he has now returned to work.
17.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act and find
that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the
conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of
the Act. To reduce the prejudice to the Landlord, the relief is subject to
section 78 of the Act which allows the Landlord to file for eviction if the
Tenant misses any of the payments set out in this order.
 
It is ordered that:
 
L1 rent owing application:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before June 9,
2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $1,108.65*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to May 29, 2018 and the total charges related to an NSF cheque tendered to
the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant, less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $38.14 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
May 30, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 9, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June 10,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 9, 2018, then starting June 10, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 10, 2018.
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $2,517.00 if the payment is made on or before May 31, 2018, or
ii)       $3,677.00 if the payment is made on or before June 9, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after June 10, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
L2
persistent late rent application:
10.   If the Tenant pays the amount required to void
the rent arrears portion of this order, then the tenancy will continue subject
to the following condition:
(a) 
The Tenant shall pay the Landlord the full
monthly rent on or before the first day of each month for a twelve month period
commencing July 1, 2018 through to and including June 1, 2019.
11.   If the Tenant fails to make any one of the payments
ordered in paragraph 10, in full and on time, the Landlord may apply under
section 78 of the Act, without notice to the Tenant for an order terminating
the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord must make this application no
later than 30 days after the Tenant’s failure to make a payment.
