In the matter
of:


2, 72 BARBARA CRESCENT KITCHENER ON N2M4N2


 




Between:


Laurie Lafleur
  Joel Lafleur


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Nicole Wagner


Tenant



 
 
 
Laurie Lafleur
and Joel Lafleur (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Nicole Wagner (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential
complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on January 24, 2022. The Landlord, J. Lafleur (JL), and the Tenant attended the
hearing. The Tenant had an opportunity to speak with Tenant Duty Counsel before
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlords served two N5 Notices
of Termination on the Tenant.
 
2.    
The first N5 Notice was served
on the Tenant on May 11, 2021. The Notice alleges that on
various dates, the Tenant left six piles of dog excrement in the residential
complex. JL testified that he knows
the excrement to be from the Tenant’s
dog as the dog has become
accustomed to defecating in the same area. JL submitted into evidence a video
showing the Tenant’s son take the dog to the back of the residential complex,
the dog defecated, and the son did not pick it up. The Tenant conceded that
this occurred.
 
3.    
The second N5 Notice was served on
the Tenant on September 27, 2021. It alleged that on various dates, the Tenant
left piles of dog excrement in the residential complex. Photographs were
submitted into evidence. JL submitted into evidence a video showing the
Tenant’s dog defecating and it was not picked up. The Tenant testified that it
was her dog in the video, but it was not clear if anyone picked up after it.
 
4.    
Subsection 64 (1) of the Act states:




 
A landlord
may give a tenant notice
of termination of the tenancy
if the conduct of the tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the tenant is
such that it substantially interferes with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex for all usual purposes
by the landlord or another tenant or substantially interferes
with another lawful right, privilege or interest of the landlord or another
tenant. 2006, c. 17, s. 64 (1).
 
5.     I find that the Tenant’s occupant substantially
interfered with the Landlords’ and other tenants’ reasonable enjoyment. The
Tenant conceded to this event. JL’s testimony was that the contractors and those cutting
grass have to avoid the dog excrement, other tenants do not
let their kids out to play and the Landlords have to clean up the dog feces
themselves. As such, I find that the first N5 Notice is valid.
 
6.    
Subsection 68(1) of the Act states
that:
 
A landlord
may give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy
if,
(a)  
a
notice of termination was given to the tenant under section
62, 64 or 67; and
(b)  
more than seven days but less than
six months after the notice mentioned in clause (a) was given to the tenant, an
activity takes place, conduct occurs or a situation arises that constitutes grounds for a notice of termination under
section 60, 61, 62, 64 or 67, other than an activity, conduct
or a situation that is described
in subsection 61 (1) and that involves
an illegal act, trade, business
or occupation described in
clause 61 (2) (a). 2006, c. 17, s. 68
(1); 2017, c. 13, s. 12.
 
7.     This section entitles the Landlord to serve a
non-voidable N5 if there is another incident that occurs more than seven days
but less than six months after the Landlord served the first N5 Notice.
 
8.     On a balance of probabilities, I find that the Tenant
or her occupant or guest left dog excrement
in the residential complex on the dates described in the second
N5 Notice. While the Tenant submitted that it is not clear
whether someone picked
up the excrement, I prefer the Landlord’s evidence that it was not, based
on the photographs and the video. As found
above, the act of leaving dog excrement substantially interferes with the
Landlords’ and other tenant’s reasonable enjoyment.
 
SECTION 83 CONSIDERATIONS
 
9.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction
subject to the condition(s) set out
in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
10.  The Tenant disclosed that she has lived in the unit
for over five years. If the tenancy was terminated, she could not afford market
rent. As eviction is a remedy of last resort, I find it
appropriate to grant relief from eviction, provided
the Tenant meet the conditions set out in this order.




 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.   
The Landlords’ application for eviction of the Tenant is denied
on the condition that:
a.   
Beginning February 24, 2022 and for 12 months thereafter, the Tenant shall
not leave dog excrement in
the residential complex.
 
2.   
If the Tenant fails to comply with
the conditions set out in paragraph 1 above, then, within 30 days of the breach, the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for
an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord must
make the application within 30 days of a breach of a condition set out in
paragraph 1 of this order.
 
3.   
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.   
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlords the full amount owing on or before February 28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from March 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
