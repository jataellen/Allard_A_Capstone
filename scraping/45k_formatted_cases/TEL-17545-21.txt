Badar-e-munir Atique                                                                                                                  Tenant
 
 
 
Narmin Hemani and Hafiz Abdulla (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order requiring Badar-e-munir Atique (the 'Tenant') to pay
the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on September 29, 2021.
The Landlord, Narmin Hemani, and the Tenant attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.      
The Tenant was in possession of the rental
unit on the date the application was filed.
 
2.     The Tenant did not pay the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
May 1, 2021 to May 31, 2021.
 
3.     The Tenant submitted that he gave the required notice
to terminate his lease based on section 95 of the Act. The Tenant
submitted that he provided a potential assignee
to the Landlord and therefore
he met his obligation under the Act in regard to providing the required notice.
 
4.     The Tenant relies on a text message conversation that
he had with a third party (Syed Tariq) advising
him that he was vacating his rental unit and that he should contact the
Landlord to make further arrangements to take over this unit. The Tenant did not provide
any evidence that he contacted the Landlord directly to discuss the possibility
of assigning the lease. Simply providing the contact information of the
Landlord to a third party is not enough to assign a lease. The Tenant should
have made direct contact with the Landlord and informed him of his intentions to assign the lease to another person.
As well, section 95 states that the assignment of the lease is subject
to the Landlord’s approval. The Tenant never formally discussed the assignment
of the lease with the Landlord and he never obtained
the consent of the Landlord,
which is also a requirement

under section 95 of the Act. Consequently, I find that the notice of termination provided by the Tenant
is inadequate as it is less than the required 60 days notice.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $1,924.73, which represents the amount of rent
owing up to May 31, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlords $201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing on or before June 11,
2021, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from June 12, 2021
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
