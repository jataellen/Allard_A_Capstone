Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-02920-21
 
 



In the matter of:


6607 MAYFIELD ROAD BRAMPTON ON L6P0H8


 




Between:


Jagtar Raman


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Marianna Argiropulos Peter Pontales Argiropulos


Tenants



 
 
 
Jagtar Raman (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Peter Pontales
Argiropulos and Marianna Argiropulos (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord
requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard via video conference on January 20,
2022.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s legal representative, Deepinder Loomba, and the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
For the following reasons,
I find that the Landlords’ application must be dismissed.
 
2.    
At the hearing, the Landlords confirmed
that the rental
property is divided
into at least
two separate rental units. The Tenant lives on the main floor, which has
4 bedrooms, and there is a separate rental unit in the basement which has 3
bedrooms.
 
3.    
As I explained at the hearing,
because the Tenants
do not occupy the entire
house and, in fact, only occupy the main floor unit, this unit needs to
be identified on the notice of termination.
 
4.    
The Landlords served a notice of termination pursuant to subsection 48(1)(a) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'). The notice
fails to identify
the main floor rental unit.
 
5.    
Subsection 43(1)(a) states that every notice
of termination must identify the rental
unit. In the matter before me, as the notice fails to
identify the rental unit, it
does not comply with




File Number: CEL-02920-21
 
the mandatory requirements of the Act and is invalid. As the notice of termination is invalid, the Landlords’ application must be dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlords’ application is dismissed.
