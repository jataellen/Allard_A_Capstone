In the matter
of:


78 JEWEL HOUSE
LANE BARRIE ON L4N5X1


 




Between:


Anna Huynh
Oliver Shang-Kit Keung


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Gyorgy Peter Balazs Sandrella Balazs


Tenants



 
 
 
Anna Huynh and
Oliver Shang-Kit Keung (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Gyorgy Peter
Balazs and Sandrella
Balazs (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 3, 2022.
 
The Landlord,
Anna Huynh, the Landlords’ Legal Representative, Lillian
Bodnakar, and the Tenant,
Peter Balazs, attended the hearing.
 
The Landlords’
claim for the period ending March 31, 2022 exceeds the Board’s monetary
jurisdiction of $35,000.00. The Landlord indicated a desire to proceed with the
hearing of the application and voluntarily waived the portion of the claim that
exceeds the Board’s monetary jurisdiction.
 
At the hearing the Tenant, Peter
Balazs, requested an amendment to the application removing his minor
children as named tenants. The Board
consented to this request; the minor children are removed from the application.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from March 1, 2020 to October
31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlords
served a Notice of Termination
effective April 22, 2021.
 
2.    
The lawful monthly rent is $2,550.00.
 
3.    
The Tenants paid $5,100.00
after the application was filed.




 
4.    
The Landlords collected a rent
deposit of $2,550.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being
held by the Landlords. There has been no interest
paid on the last month’s
rent deposit.
 
5.     It is undisputed that the total rent arrears owing to the Landlords by the Tenants to
March 31, 2022 is $56,100.00.
 
Landlords’ Evidence
 
6.     The Landlord testified that the Tenants have not paid
rent since February 2020, and therefore on April 7, 2021,
the Tenants were served with an N4 Notice of Termination (‘the N4 Notice’).
 
7.     The Landlord testified that she had several conversations with the Tenants
with respect to the arrears of rent. She stated she was sympathetic to their
situation and accepted the Tenants’ reasons for not paying
the rent and relied on the numerous
promises that the rent
would be paid, which is why the N4 Notice
was not served
until a year after the rent arrears started to accumulate.
 
8.     The Landlord testified that she has proposed several
payment plans to the Tenants. The
most recent proposal reduced the amount of arrears owed to $20,000.00 with an
agreement to terminate the tenancy on December 31, 2021. The Landlord testified that the Tenants advised her that their
money was delayed but would pay the arrears as soon as funds were made available. The Landlord submitted
that the Tenants
have continuously made
promises to pay the arrears but have not followed through.
 
9.     The Landlord further testified that the rent arrears
have caused her considerable stress especially
while she was pregnant. There
have been several
disagreements with her family
due to her leniency with the Tenants and she fears the mortgage on the property
will not be renewed.
 
10.  The Landlord is seeking a standard order as the
Tenants have only paid two months of rent in the last 24 months and the arrears
already exceed the Board’s monetary jurisdiction.
 
Tenant’s Evidence
 
11.  The Tenant testified that he is self employed as an
Intake Officer. His current source of
income is from his pension
at $1,600.00 per month. His primary source
of income is based
on commission and his earned
commissions have not been paid to
him since before April 2020 resulting in his inability to pay the rent. He recognizes he is currently unable to
pay the monthly rent, let alone
pay anything towards
the rent arrears
but is committed to paying to the Landlord all the money
owed. He stated that he cannot move his family due to financial limitations and
does not want to terminate the tenancy. He
requested the Board grant relief from eviction for 60 days however, he is
unsure as to when he will receive a commission cheque.




 
12.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), including the Tenants’ personal and financial circumstances, and also
any potential prejudice to the Landlords that granting relief would result in.
I find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until March 31,
2022, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
13.  I do not think denying
eviction is appropriate because it appears
to be case that the tenancy
is not viable. In other words, the evidence before me suggests that the Tenants
cannot afford the unit and their assertion that they will pay back the arrears
is speculative and not
supported by the evidence before me. However, I note that the Tenants have two
minor children who will be impacted
by being evicted from their home.
Any further delay beyond March
31, 2022 would be unfair to the Landlords given that the current arrears are
significant and beyond the Board’s monetary jurisdiction.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 31, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $35,000*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to March 31, 2022, less
the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $83.84 per
day for compensation for the use of the unit starting April 1, 2022 to the date
the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing* on or before April 1, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from April 2, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated on or
before March 31, 2022, then starting April 1, 2022, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction
may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after
April 1, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before March 31, 2022, the Tenants pay the
amount of $58,836.00** to the Landlords or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenants
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after April 1,




 
2022 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenants are
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlords.
