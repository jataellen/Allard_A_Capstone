Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-21993-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


PH5, 150 EAST
LIBERTY STREET TORONTO ON
  M6K3R5


 




Between:


Fay Jensen


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Elijah Johnson Mandy Gommlich


Tenants



 
 
 
Fay Jensen
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Elijah
Johnson and Mandy Gommlich (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021. The Landlord,
their Legal Representative,
Luis Hernandez and the Tenants attended the hearing. The Tenants met with
Tenant Duty Counsel and obtained summary legal information prior to the
commencement of the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    In reviewing the Notice to End your Tenancy
For Non-payment of Rent (N4) filed with the Board and forming the basis of the Landlord’s application. It was noted that only one row
of the rent owing table had been completed encapsulating the rental period
starting 15/11/2020 and ending on 15/03/2021.
 
2.   
At the hearing it was indicated
that the rental
periods commence on the 15th of each month and conclude on the 14th.
 
3.   
This is not accurately reflected on the N4 notice which had been served
to the Tenants, as the notice
is flawed it is considered invalid, and termination of a tenancy cannot be
based upon an invalid notice.
