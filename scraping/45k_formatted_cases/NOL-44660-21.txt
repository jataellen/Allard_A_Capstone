The tenancy
between the Landlord

for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before

will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
January 29, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January

file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
