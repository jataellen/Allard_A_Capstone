Galaxy Value Add Ontario
Properties LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Shawntal
Saviour (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that
the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges and related
administration charges.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 19, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Sylwia McArthur, attended the hearing. As of 9:55 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
July 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August
26, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
December 5, 2021. The Tenant was in possession
of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1788.50.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord incurred
charges of $10.00 for a cheque tendered
by or on behalf of the
Tenant, which was returned NSF and $20.00 for related administration charges.
 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,750.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
