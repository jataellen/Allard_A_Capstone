In the matter of:      2, 95 GERTRUDE
STREET

Between:                  Aaron Bodajla                                    Landlord

Aaron Murkami Tara Rose


Tenants




 
On December 29, 2021, Aaron
Bodajla (the 'Landlord') applied in this L4 application for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tara Rose and Aaron Murkami
(the 'Tenants') and for an order
to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a
condition specified in the review order issued by the Board on November 9, 2021
with respect to L1 application SOL-16382-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.       
I find that the Tenants have not
met the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenants failed to pay the lawful rent for December 2021
in full on or before December 1, 2021; and the Tenants failed to pay $500.00
towards the outstanding arrears in full on or before December
15, 2021. This L4
application was filed within
30 days of the breaches.
 
3.       
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenants were ordered to pay
$8,911.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application
fee in Order SOL-16382-20. The amount that is still owing from that order is $8,411.00
and that amount
is included in this
order. As a result, the previous
review order SOL-16382-20 is cancelled.
 
5.       
Since the date of the review
order, the Tenants
have failed to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from
December 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.




 
6.       
On May 1, 2020 the Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,800.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenants for the period from May 1, 2020 to January 26, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The previous review order SOL-16382-20 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move
out of the rental
unit on or before
February 6, 2022 (standard 11 days from the issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
If the Tenants made any payments
after this L4 application was filed, those
amounts shall be deducted
from the calculations below.
 
See attached
Summary of Calculations
 
4.       
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$8,381.60*. This amount represents the rent owing up to December 31, 2021 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
5.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $59.18 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 1, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
6.       
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
6, 2022, the Tenants will start
to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from February 7, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 6, 2022, then starting February
7, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 7, 2022.
 
 
January 26, 2022

The tenants have until February 7, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to
set aside the order under s.
78(9) of the Act. If the tenants file the motion by February 7, 2022 the order
will be stayed and the Board will schedule a hearing.
 
If you have any questions about this order,
call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.
 
In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on August
7, 2022 if the order has not been filed
on or before this date with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the
rental unit is located.
