Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-34855-21



In the matter
of:


1106,
  2 VENA WAY TORONTO ON M9M0G5


 




Between:


Medallion Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Clara Grisel Mendoza Gustavo Vasquez Monroy


 
Tenants



 
 
Medallion Corporation (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Clara Grisel
Mendoza and Gustavo
Vasquez Monroy (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard by video conference on January 10, 2022. Only the
Landlord's Legal Representative, Samuel Korman, attended the hearing. As of
3:47 p.m. the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective September 7, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
3.    
The lawful monthly rent is $2,555.00.
4.    
The Tenants paid $7,755.00
after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,555.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from November
1, 2020 to September 7, 2021.
 
7.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with section 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact
of COVID-19 on the parties and
whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the
Tenants, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 20, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $3,841.82*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 9, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $84.00
per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 10, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of
the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before
February 20, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 21, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 20, 2022, then starting
February 21, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 21, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 20, 2022, the Tenants pay
the amount of $8,322.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction
will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 21, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
February 9, 2022
