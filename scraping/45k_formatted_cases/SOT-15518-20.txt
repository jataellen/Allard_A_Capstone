Order under Section 57
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: SOT-15518-20
 



In the matter
of:


58 LORAINE DRIVE
ST CATHARINES ON L2P3N8


 




Between:


Dariusz Wolanin Anna Faber-Wolanin


Tenants




 


and


 




 


Ravinder Khanna


Landlord



 
Dariusz Wolanin and Anna Faber-Wolanin (the 'Tenants') applied
for an order determining
Ravinder Khanna (the Landlord) gave a N12 notice of termination in bad faith.
This application was heard via video/teleconference on September 22, 2021.
The Tenants, the Landlord
and the Landlord's Legal Representative attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     On June 25, 2020 the Tenants filed an application with
the Board purporting that they moved out of the rental unit because the
Landlord gave the Tenants a (N13) notice of termination claiming the Landlord
wanted to do repairs or renovations to the rental
unit.
 
2.     The Tenants moved out
of the rental unit on October 1, 2019.
 
3.     The Tenants’ attended
a Case Management Hearing (‘CMH’)
on July 22, 2020, the Landlord did not attend. The matter
was directed to a merit hearing.
 
4.    
On July 23, 2020 the Board
issued an Interim Order directing the parties shall no later than July 27, 2020,
email each other all evidence
and file with the Board a copy of any evidence that they wish to rely on
during the hearing.
 
5.     The basis of the Tenant’s application is that the
Landlord gave the Tenants a N13 notice of termination claiming
the Landlord wanted to do repairs
or renovations to the rental
unit. The Tenant’s application pleads that approximately a month after
they moved out of the rental unit, they learned that the Landlord did not
subsequently sell the house, that he had
re-rented the unit.
 
6.     The application filed and the pleadings are
contradictory. It was disclosed at the hearing that the Landlord did not give the Tenant’s
a N13 notice, that the Landlord gave a ‘verbal’ notice.

7.    
Subsection 37(1) of the Act states “a tenancy
may be terminated only in accordance with this Act”, which means a tenancy can
only be terminated by proper notice, by way of an agreement between the Tenants
and the Landlord, or by way of an order issued by the Board.
 
8.     Section 43(1) of the Act states. Where this Act
permits a landlord or tenant to give a notice
of termination, a proper
notice shall be in a form approved
by the Board and shall,
(a)  
identify the rental unit for which the notice
is given;
(b)  
state the date on which the tenancy is to terminate; and
(c)  
be signed by the person giving the notice,
or the person’s agent.
 
9.    
Based on the testimonies given by
both parties, no proper notice was given to end the tenancy by either the Landlord nor the Tenants
in accordance with section 43 of the Act.
 
10.  Consequently, I must find that the Landlord
did not give the Tenants
a notice in bad faith.
 
11.  The order contains
all the reasons
for the decision within the order. No other reasons
will be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant’s application is dismissed.
