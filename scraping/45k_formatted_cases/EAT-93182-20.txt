File Number: EAT-93182-20
 



In the matter
of:


APT 12,
174 DIVISION STREET KINGSTON ON K7L3M8


 




Between:


Roger Duquette


Tenant




 


and


 




 


Prithvipal Dadalia


Landlord



 
Roger Duquette (the 'Tenant')
applied for an order determining that Prithvipal Dadalia (the 'Landlord') failed
to meet the Landlord's maintenance obligations under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') or failed to comply with
health, safety, housing or maintenance standards.
 
This application was heard via
video/teleconference on October
27, 2021.
 
The Tenant, the Tenant's
Legal Representative Micah-Zierer Clyke and the Landlord attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The residential complex
is a mixed unit commercial/residential building.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Tenant and the Landlord
commenced October 1,
2016.
 
3.     The Tenant testified
that the whole residential complex
has had an ongoing cockroach and bed bug infestation problem
dating back to 2019.
 
4.    
Subsection 20(1) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) provides that a landlord is responsible for providing and maintaining a residential complex,
and the rental units in it, in a good state of
repair and fit for habitation and for complying with health, safety, housing
and maintenance standards.
 
5.    
The Tenant (as applicant) bear the burden
of proof. The standard of proof in proceedings
before the Board is “proof on a balance of probabilities.” By that standard,
the party bearing the burden of proof must show with evidence that, “more
likely than not”, their assertions are true.
 
6.     The Tenant submitted
a number of photographs of the
damage to a printer and a soiled mattress.




 
7.    
The Tenant is seeking $497.00 for
the costs to repair/replace property damaged or destroyed because
the Landlord failed to maintain
the rental unit and properly
treat the unit and
residential complex for a pest infestation.
 
8.     The issue to be determined by the Board is whether
the Landlord(s) failed to comply
with subsection 20(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
by not treating the rental unit and/or residential complex for a pest
infestation once the Landlord was made aware of the problem.
 
9.    
Based on the totality
of the testimonies given and the evidence
submitted, on a balance
of probabilities, I find that the Landlord failed to meet the Landlord's
obligations under subsection 20(1) of the Act to repair and maintain the rental
unit to comply with health, safety, housing and property maintenance standards.
 
10.  The other issue to be determined is on awarding
remedies that span a time frame that
goes beyond the one-year period preceding the filing of the Tenant’s
Application.
 
11.  Subsection 29(2) of the Act imposes a one-year limitation period on the remedies
available to the Tenant, calculated from the date the Tenant filed the
application.
 
12.  The pertinent sections
of the Act are sections
29, 30 and 31. Subsection 29(1) sets out
the grounds for tenants’
applications. Subsection 29(2)
sets out the time within
which the Tenant can bring
the application.
 
13.  Subsection 29(2) reads as follows:
No application may be made under subsection (1) more than one year after the day the alleged
conduct giving rise to the application occurred.
 
14.  The Tenant filed the application with the Board on
October 23, 2020, the Board has no jurisdiction to consider losses
arising prior to October 23, 2019, therefore
remedies being claimed before
October 23, 2019 are considered statue-barred.
 
15.  The Tenant stated that the Landlord was first notified
of the ‘existence’ of cockroaches in the rental unit on April 18, 2019 and again January 20,
2020.
 
16.  Subsection 29(2) sets out a one-year limitation period
for bringing an application under subsection 29(1). If a single event or one
occasion of an ongoing event occur within the one-year limitation period, the application may proceed. This subsection does not
contain any limitation on the remedy available, when the application is
brought in time. Once the application is brought in time, the potential remedy
may include the entire period that the condition existed. The bringing of the
application and the remedies available under section 30 and 31 of the Act are
distinct. Once the application is brought in time, subsection 29(2) does not
play a role in the assessment of the remedy.
 
17.  Sections 30 and 31 set out remedies
for breach of section 29(1). Section 30 sets out the
remedies when there has been a failure to maintain the premises in a good state
of repair. Section 31 provides remedies for the other grounds set out in
subsection 29(1).




 
18.  There is nothing
in sections 30 and 31 limiting the remedies to one year prior to bringing
the application. The remedies available in sections 30 and 31 are separate and
distinct and are not limited by the limitation period set out in subsection
29(2).
 
19.   The limitations on the remedies
available to the tenants under sections 30 and
31 are as follows:
 
Subsection 30(2) provides that
when determining the remedy available to the Tenant, the Board shall consider
whether the tenant
advised the landlord
of the alleged breaches before
applying to the Board.
 
20.  In the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 damages, or
rather remedies, are contained in sections 30 and 31, not in subsection 29(2), so subsection 29(2) does not limit the award
of remedies, only the commencement of an application.
 
21.  In addition, when addressing the interpretation of
subsection 29(2), it is important to consider the purposes of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 and the principles of statutory interpretation. According
to the principles of statutory interpretation, statutes should be interpreted as being remedial
and should be given
such fair, large and liberal interpretation as best ensures
the attainment of its objects.
 
22.  The objects of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 are set out in section 1 of the Act,
which reads as follows:
 
The purposes of
this Act is to establish a framework for the regulation of residential rents,
to balance the rights and responsibilities of residential landlords and tenants and to provide
for the adjudication of
disputes and for other processes to informally resolve disputes.
 
23.  Therefore, when applying subsection 29(2), it is
important to give that provision an interpretation that best achieves the
remedial goals of the legislation and balances the rights and responsibilities
of landlords and tenants. If there is any ambiguity or doubt about the meaning of the legislation, it must be resolved in favour of the benefits
seeking person the legislation was meant to protect.
 
24.  The Tenant had earlier stated that the Landlord was first notified
of the ‘existence’ of
cockroaches in the rental unit on April 18, 2019.
 
25.  The Tenant had submitted a copy of a letter
sent to the Landlord from Queen’s Law Clinic
on behalf of the Tenant outlining the ongoing
pest infestation and other non-maintenance issues dated January 20,
2020.
 
Pursuant to subsection 30(2), I was satisfied the tenant advised
the landlord of the
alleged breaches before applying to the Board.
 
26.  The landlord shall be ordered to pay to the Tenant the
$497.00 for the costs to repair/replace property damaged
or destroyed because
the Landlord failed
to maintain the rental
unit and properly
treat the unit and residential complex for a pest infestation.




 
27.  The order contains
all the reasons for the decision within
the order. No other reasons
will be issued.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord shall pay to the Tenant
a rent abatement of $497.00.
 
2.     The landlord shall also pay to the Tenant $53.00
for the costs of the application fee.
 
3.     The total amount
the Landlord owes the Tenant is $550.00*.
 
4.     The Landlord shall pay the Tenant the full amount
owing* by February
15, 2022.
 
5.     If the Landlord does not pay the Tenant the full
amount owing by February 15, 2022 the Landlord
will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 16, 2020
at 2.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
 
6.     If the Landlord
does not pay the Tenant the full amount owing by
February 15, 2022, the Tenant may
recover this amount by deducting the amount from the monthly rent each month
should the Tenant still occupy the rental unit.
 
7.     The Tenant has the right,
at any time, to collect from the Landlord the full amount
owing or any balance outstanding under this order.
