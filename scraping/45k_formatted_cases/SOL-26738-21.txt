316, 710 CONCESSION STREET HAMILTON ON L8V1C2


 




Between:


Poloco Holdings Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kaeline Krahn
  Shilo Bonell


Tenants



 
 
 
On December 18, 2021 Poloco Holdings
Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kaeline Krahn and
Shilo Bonell (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent
they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order
issued by the Board on December 7, 2021 with respect to application
SOL-18394-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     In the application the Landlord claims
that the Tenants
breached the following condition(s) specified in the
order:
 
The Tenants failed to pay to the
Landlord $1,900 on or before June 25, 2021. The
Tenants did not pay the full monthly
rent on or before July 01, 2021 and the Tenants did not pay $400 on or before July 09,
2021
 
3.     However, the Landlord
filed this application by email to the Board on December
18, 2021. The application was
filed more than 30 days after the missed payments were due in the order.
Therefore, the Landlord’s claim that the Tenants breached the order is out of
time.
 
4.     The Board has no jurisdiction to consider this application, which was filed beyond 30 days
after the alleged breaches.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
