In the matter
of:


302, 701 DANFORTH AVENUE TORONTO ON M4J1L2


 




Between:


Truevine Investments Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jennifer
Draxl


Tenant



 
 
Truevine Investments Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Jennifer Draxl (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant entered into an agreement to
terminate the tenancy. That application was resolved by order TSL-24706-21
issued on November 8, 2021.
 
The Tenant filed a motion to set aside order TSL-24706-21. This motion
was heard by videoconference on January 6, 2022.
The Landlord
and the Tenant
attended the hearing. The Landlord was represented by Oleksandr Pichugin.
 
Also in attendance were the Landlord’s witnesses, Toula Antonopolis and Greg Kanargelidis.
 
Determinations:
 
PRELIMINARY ISSUE
 
1.    
At the beginning of the
hearing, the Landlord’s representative raised a preliminary issue with respect
to whether the Tenant’s brother,
Christos Draxl, was able to participate in the hearing as his
sister’s agent, as he is a licensed paralegal registered with the Law Society
of Ontario with a status of
not providing legal services
(meaning, according to the Law Society of Ontario website: a paralegal who is
not currently providing legal services).
 
2.    
When the Landlord’s representative inquired with the Law Society
of Ontario of whether
the CD could participate as his sister’s agent, the response he received was:
 
The exemption
in subsection 30(5) of By-Law
4 does not apply to some[one] whose profession includes the provision
of legal services.




 
3.    
Given this response, the Landlord submits
that CD should not be permitted to represent
his sister and the matter should be treated as uncontested.
 
4.    
CD testified that he is
a licensed paralegal in good standing and has paid his fees, but that he does not have insurance
and was appearing on behalf
of the Tenant as his sister,
since she has COVID19 and was not able to appear. He says he will not be
receiving compensation for his attendance at the hearing.
 
ANALYSIS
 
5.    
Subsection 1 (6) of the Law
Society Act defines the provision of legal service
to include conduct where one:
 
3. Represents a person
in a proceeding before an adjudicative body.
 
[Emphasis added.]
 
6.    
Subsection 30(5) of the Law Society
of Ontario’s By-Law
4 states:
 
30.    
The following may, without a licence, provide
legal services in Ontario that a
licensee who holds a Class P1 licence is authorized to provide:
 
5.    
An individual,
 
i.   whose profession or occupation is not and does not include the provision
of legal services or the practice of law,
 
ii.    who provides the legal services
only for and on behalf
of a related person, within the meaning of the Income Tax Act
(Canada), and
 
iii.   who does not expect and does not receive any compensation, including a fee, gain or reward, direct or
indirect, for the provision of the legal services.
 
7.    
Based on the evidence
before the Board, I find the Tenant’s brother is not permitted to provide legal services by appearing before
the Board on behalf of his sister or
by acting as a family member
since his profession/occupation includes the provision of legal services and
the exemption under By-Law 4 did not apply. As the Tenant’s brother is a
licensed individual, the exemptions found under the Board’s Practice Direction
on Representation also do not apply.
 
8.    
After announcing his
ruling in the hearing room, I stood the hearing down so that CD could make arrangements for his
sister to attend or to seek an adjournment
if he was not able to do
so.
 
9.    
The Tenant
attended the hearing
at 1:00pm and was ready
to proceed when I called the matter forward at 2:45pm.
 
MOTION TO SET ASIDE




 
10.  The Landlord’s L3 application is based on
an agreement to terminate the tenancy which occurred through e-mail
correspondence between the parties. On September 14, 2021, the Tenant emailed
the Landlord (TA) advising that she will be moving out October 30, 2021 as she
could not pay the arrears
since her loan applications fell through. The
same day, the TA responded to this email accepting the Tenant’s move out date of October
30, 2021.
 
11.  Pursuant
to subsection 77(1)a of the Act, the Landlord filed an L3 application on October
7, 2021, based on this email exchange, and obtained an eviction order on an ex
parte (meaning without hearing) basis.
 
12.  On November 9, 2021, the Tenant filed a
motion to set aside this ex parte order. In her motion she asserts that she never
agreed to move out nor did she sign any agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
13.  This motion was brought pursuant
to subsection 77(8)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). It essentially
requires the Board to determine the following:
 
a)    
First, did the Tenant
enter into an agreement to terminate
the tenancy with the Landlord?
 
b)    
Second, if she did
enter into an agreement to terminate, is the Board satisfied “having regard to all the circumstances, that it would not be unfair” to set aside the eviction order?
 
c)     
Third, and if it would be unfair to set aside the order,
should the lifting
of the stay of the eviction order be delayed for some reason?
 
TENANT’S EVIDENCE
 
14.  The Tenant testified that she felt pressure
from TA due to her rent being in arrears and had to chose between moving out or
paying it back, so she chose the move out option. However, three days later,
she told the Landlord that she had changed her mind. The Tenant testified that
at no point did she sign any agreement with the Landlord to terminate the tenancy. Since then, she received many emails from the Landlord
and her representative.
 
15.  The Tenant testified
that she has lived in the rental
unit since May 2019 and that she was
currently receiving Ontario Disability Support program benefits. She was the
sole occupant of the rental unit which was a bachelor apartment and always paid
$700-
$800.00 each month; in April 2021, she had paid all her arrears
but for $69.00.
 
16.  On cross-examination, the Tenant confirmed
that she had emailed the Landlord in September 2021 to advise she would be moving
out at the end of October 2021 and
that the Landlord accepted
her request and agreed to this date. The Tenant could not confirm but said it could be true that
she received an email from the Landlord
on October 1, 2021
thanking her for the payment she made on September 29, 2021 and indicating the
last month's rent deposit
would apply to October 2021. The
Tenant further confirmed that she sent the
Landlord an email on October 4, 2021 rescinding her offer to move out. The




 
Tenant confirmed
that she was going to move out October 30, 2021 but changed her mind after she connected with her agent
who had a place available effective March 2022.
 
17.  The Tenant seeks to remain in the rental unit. In
the alternative, if her motion is denied, the Tenant seeks until February
28, 2022 to vacate the premises.
 
LANDLORD’S EVIDENCE
 
18.  The Landlord’s witness, Toula Antonopoulos, who is
the director of the company, testified that she corresponded with the Tenant
with respect to any issues
that arose. She testified that the first mention of rent
arrears came from the Tenant when she emailed her on September 14, 2021
requesting to move out October 30, 2021. This email stated in part:












 
19. 
Forty minutes
later TA responded
with the following:












 
20. 
On October
1, 2021, TA wrote to the Tenant
stating the following:
















 
21. 
The Tenant responded to this email,
five hours later,
stating:












 
22.  TA testified that at no point during this
email exchange did the Tenant raise an issue of feeling pressured to move out;
in fact, the Tenant consistently thanked her for her politeness throughout this
exchange. Upon accepting the Tenant’s offer to vacate, TA secured another
tenant to take the rental
unit, collected a deposit
and obtained a signed
tenancy agreement.
 
23.  On October
2, 2021, the Tenant emailed the Landlord advising that she would pay the
rent for October 2021 the following week and that she had put a $900.00 deposit
down for another place before she found out that her agent’s home was
available for rent in March 2022. The Tenant sought to continue the tenancy
till then.
 
24.  The Landlord responded to this email
indicated that they had already secured another tenant for the unit,
signed an agreement with them and collected a deposit. As such, they were unable to continue with the
tenancy beyond October 30, 2021.
 
25.  The Tenant wrote to the Landlord on October 4, 2021 and
stated:












26.  TA testified that on October 18 or 20th 2021, she attended the rental unit to provide a notice of entry for heating maintenance and found a handwritten notice
to vacate posted




 
on the Tenant’s door from the Tenant with a move-out
date of November 15, 2021. She
informed her paralegal who proceeded to send a N11 to the Tenant for her
signature.
 
27.  The Landlord opposes
the Tenant’s motion
to set aside the order as the Landlord
relied on the Tenant’s notice and secured another tenant to rent the
place; however, the Landlord is agreeable to the stay being lifted February 28,
2022.
 
ANALYSIS
 
28. 
An
agreement to terminate is a binding written contract. Absent a compelling
reason to set the agreement
aside, I believe
the Board should
enforce agreements entered
into by landlords and tenants.
Compelling reasons to set aside such an agreement would include, but is not
limited to, things like duress; fraud or negligent misrepresentation; or
mistake of fact or law.
 
29. 
At
some point during the hearing, the Tenant disputed the validity of the
agreement to terminate the tenancy;
her email to the Landlord
dated October 4, 2021 indicated that an email is not
a legal contract.
 
30. 
While
Section 43 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 outlines the mandatory
requirements of a notice of termination, subsection 77 (1)(b) does not outline
requirements for an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
The Act is silent about
whether this agreement can be oral,
or whether it has to be in
writing. However, section 53(4) of
Ontario Regulation 516/06 states: “An application to the Board must be accompanied by the following information….If the
application is made under section 77 of the Act with
respect to an agreement to terminate the tenancy, a copy of the agreement.” So, it can be deduced that if there is an agreement
to terminate the tenancy, it must be in writing.
 
31. 
The
Landlord relied on Moore v. 2013798 Ontario Inc., 2018 ONSC 3750 which
was an appeal of a decision where the Board found there was agreement to
terminate the tenancy when the Landlord sent an email to the Tenants stating
they would try to resolve problems but if that was not to the Tenant’s
satisfaction, the Landlords
would be happy to
end the lease at any time. The Tenants responded
to this email stating they would accept the offer and move out June 30,
2016. (see paragraph 2 of the decision).
 
32.  At paragraph [6], the Court
found
 
[6] The Board found as a fact that there was an agreement
to terminate on the basis of the exchange of e-mails. That
was a reasonable finding on the material before
it.
 
[Emphasis added.]
 
33.  The
most basic component of any
valid contract or agreement is an offer from one party and acceptance of that offer by the other. In this case,
based on the evidence before the
Board, I find the Tenant offered to terminate the tenancy October 30, 2021 and
the




 
Landlord accepted this offer; these
offers were exchanged in writing, and the response occurred within a reasonable
timeframe.
 
34.  I do not find this agreement was the result
of undue coercion
or pressure by the Landlord. I say this because
the evidence before
me did not suggest that the Tenant was pressured into choosing to move out. The Landlord’s evidence
was, the Tenant requested to move out and proposed the date – and the Landlord
accepted. I also say this based on the
Tenant’s evidence
and her email dated October
4, 2021 where she states “I was going to move out but then I was offered an
opportunity to move into a beautiful apt in March 2022…” and her email to the
Landlord on October 2, 2021 advising she has put a
$900.00 deposit
on a new place.
 
35.  I prefer the evidence of the Landlord
as their evidence
remained certain and
consistent
throughout while the Tenant’s account
of what happened changed significantly during the hearing.
Initially, the Tenant stated that she had never agreed to move out but her
email from September 14, 2021 contradicted this. Then she stated that she
rescinded her offer three days after sending the Landlord the email to move out
October 30, 2021 but the
Tenant’s own email evidence shows it was approximately twenty days
later that the Tenant unilaterally rescinded her offer to vacate October
30, 2021. These inconsistencies undermine the credibility
of the Tenant’s evidence and cause me to believe that the Tenant likely signed
the agreement, was about to move out (as she secured a place and put down a $900.00
deposit), found a better place
to move into and
has now changed
her mind about moving out October 30, 2021. I also find that the
unilateral rescinding of the agreement by the Tenant is not valid. Neither
party to a contract or agreement can unilaterally change its terms. This is a
basic premise of contract law.
36.  The next question,
then, is whether
under all of the circumstances, it would not be unfair to set aside the eviction order.
 
37.  The Tenant sought
additional time to make alternative living arrangements to February
28, 2022. The Landlord was agreeable to this date.
 
38.  An order shall issue accordingly, lifting the stay February 28, 2022.
 
39.  This order contains
all of the reasons for my decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The motion
to set aside Order TSL-24706-21, issued on November
8, 2021 is denied.
 
2.    
The stay of order TSL-24706-21 is lifted February
28, 2022.
