Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: NOL-44315-21



In the matter
of:


BACK HOUSE, 135 CEDAR
STREET N TIMMINS ON P4N6J4


 




Between:


2374535 Ontario Ltd


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Dylan Bourgon Kashina Castonguay
Lisa Bourgon


Tenants



 
 
2374535 Ontario Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Lisa Bourgon, Kashina Castonguay and Dylan
Bourgon (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 27, 2022. Only
the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Kelly Hawkes, attended the hearing. As of
2:45 p.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have
not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective October 23, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $950.00.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $900.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from November
1, 2020 to October 23, 2021.
 
7.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 19, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $5,090.31*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February
8, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
 
3.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$31.23 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 9, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
19, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 20, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 19, 2022, then starting
February 20, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 20, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 19, 2022, the Tenants pay
the amount of $6,836.00** to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 20, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
