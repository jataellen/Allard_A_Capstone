            Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-05317-18



 


 


 



 
 
MC (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict TB and RA (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay
the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on June 28,
2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, SK,
and the Tenant, RA, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent they were required to pay for the period from December 1, 2017 to
June 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective May 30, 2018.
 
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $975.18 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
 
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from March 1, 2018 to July 6, 2018.
 
4.      The Tenant is seeking a payment plan to pay off
the Tenants’ arrears and costs.  She proposed paying the rent going forward as
well as $500.00 towards arrears every two weeks.  She has been living in the
rental unit with the other Tenant, since 2010.  She pays the rent, and he pays
all the other bills.  The Tenant explained that it has been particularly
difficult to pay the rent in the last few months because her wages were being
garnished by Revenue Canada.  Going forward, her wages will no longer be
garnished, so she said she will be able to meet the payment plan.  Upon
cross-examination, the Tenant said that she has old credit card debts and loan
payments to a financial institution in addition to the debt she owes to Revenue
Canada.  She said that her partner, the other Tenant, works full time.  The
only reason she has not made any good faith payments towards the rent in seven
months is due to poor money management.  She has not looked for alternative
rental accommodation, and would need to save a first and last month rental
deposit in order to move.
 
5.      The Landlord is seeking a standard termination
order.  The Landlord’s representative submitted that the Tenants have not made any
payments towards rent for seven months quite knowingly and willfully, and not
merely because of poor money management.  He said that the Tenants are
prioritizing all their other expenses and debts over paying the Landlord, and,
in effect, treating the Landlord as a source of an interest-free loan.  The
Landlord’s representative submitted that the Tenants have been before the Board
on at least half a dozen occasions since 2016, including on a motion to void
under section 74(11) of the Act, so they are well aware of Board procedures and
process. The Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) is meant to
balance fairness between landlords and tenants, and the Landlord, in this case,
is being severely prejudiced by receiving no rent payments for over half a
year.
 
6.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.  The Tenants are
aware of Board procedures, and therefore, I find that they knew the
implications of prioritizing all other debts and expenses over paying anything
at all to the Landlord.  The Tenant has not provided convincing evidence of any
change in the Tenants’ circumstances to demonstrate that they would be able and
willing to meet the obligations of their proposed payment plan.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before July 17,
2018.
 
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $5,980.05*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to July 6, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
 
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $32.06 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting July 7, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before July 17, 2018, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from July
18, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before July 17, 2018, then starting July 18, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 18, 2018.
 
8.     
If, on or before July 17,
2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $7,934.21** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     
The Tenants may not make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after July 18, 2018
but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.  The Tenants
have already used this provision of the Act to set aside a previous eviction
order, CEL-54062-15-VO, dated April 8, 2016, during this tenancy. The Tenants
are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
