Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-93197-18










 

H.I.I.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict K.L.A
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. (L1
application)
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evicting the
Tenant because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's
rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date. (L2 application)
            
This
L1/L2 application was heard in Toronto on April 24, 2018.
 
The
Landlord’s representative, C.K (CK), and the Tenant attended the hearing. Prior
to the hearing the Tenant was assisted by Tenant Duty Counsel.
 
Determinations:
 
            L1 application
 
1.      Initially,
at the hearing, the Tenant disputed the amount of arrears. The application
states that no rent was paid for September 2017 or October 2017 and it is
uncontested that a third party paid $1,000.00 to the Landlord in each of these
months. The Tenant’s monthly rent is $1,050.00.
2.      There
is a previous order (TSL-84385-17, issued June 5, 2017) requiring that the
Tenant pay $3,490.00 to the Landlord in arrears and costs and that these
payments be made in monthly instalments. It is uncontested that a third party
paid the Landlord $2,440.00 in July 2017. A portion of this was applied to the
rent due for July 2017 ($1,050.00) and the rest, $1,390.00, was applied to
arrears, leaving a balance of $2,100.00. CK testified that in February, 2018,
she applied the amounts received for rent in September 2017 and in October 2017
toward these arrears. 
3.      The
Landlord is entitled to apply payments toward current rent or toward past
arrears and so the Landlord’s testimony fully explains how the Landlord could
have been paid in the months of September and October 2017 but that those funds
were not attributed for rent for those months. 
4.      The
Tenant initially testified that she had paid the Landlord $650.00 in cash in
July 2017 and another $650.00 in cash in August 2017. Later in the hearing, the
Tenant testified that she was wrong and that she had made payments prior to
June 2017. These payments were considered at the hearing giving rise to order
TSL-84385-17 and so they have no bearing on the determinations in this order.
5.      After
all of the above was accounted for, the parties agreed that the Tenant is in
arrears of $3,400.00 to April 30, 2018.
6.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,050.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
7.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 1, 2017 to
February 18, 2018.
8.      The
Tenant paid $2,000.00 after the application was filed.
9.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until May 31, 2018
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. The Tenant requested a payment plan
but it is uncontested that the Tenant made no payments towards arrears as
required in the previous payment plan (although a third party paid some of what
was owed) and the Tenant did not pay her full rent during the course of the
previous payment plan. The Tenant testified that she withheld her full rent and
the arrears payments because of problems she was having in the unit. This is
not a good reason to fail to comply with an order. Given the Tenant’s breaches
of the previous order and a lack of any good reason for those breaches, it is
more likely than not that the Tenant will breach any new payment plan order.
Under these circumstances it would not be appropriate to make a conditional
order. 
10.   The
Tenant has several young children and is their sole support. For this reason
the termination of the tenancy is postponed to May 31, 2018.
            L2
application
11.   It
is uncontested that the Tenant has been persistently late in paying her rent.
At the hearing the parties consented to a conditional order requiring the
Tenant to pay her rent on time and in full for twelve months.
It is ordered that:
 
Regarding
the L1 application:
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the rent arrears portion of this order as set out below, the
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before May 31, 2018.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,122.14*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to April 26, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $34.52 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting April 27, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May
31, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from June 1, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before May 31, 2018, then starting June 1, 2018,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 1, 2018.
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void the rent arrears portion of this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $3,590.00 if the payment is made on or before April 30, 2018, or
ii)       $4,640.00 if the payment is made on or before May 31, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside the rent arrears portion of this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after June 1, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this
motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
Regarding
the L2 application, on consent it is ordered that:
10.   If the
Tenant voids the eviction order, the tenancy will continue and the Tenant shall
pay the Landlord the full monthly rent on or before the first day of each month
for a twelve month period commencing May 1, 2018 through to and including April
1, 2019.
 
11.   If
the Tenant fails to make any one of the payments pursuant to paragraph 10 of this
order, in full and on time, the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006, without notice to the Tenant for an order terminating
the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord must make this application no
later than 30 days after the Tenant’s failure to make a payment.
