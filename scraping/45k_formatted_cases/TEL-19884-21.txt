Nicole Thomas Omar
Jairo Escobar


Tenants



 
 
 
Oladipupo Otubu
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Nicole Thomas and Omar Jairo
Escobar (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by way of video
conference on January
19, 2022. Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September 6, 2021 to October
5, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants paid all arrears
for the period
ending January 31, 2022 after
the application was filed.
 
3.     The only amount
outstanding is part of the Landlord's cost of filing
the application. As a
result, the order will be limited to costs only and not eviction.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
2.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before March 6, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from March 7, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
