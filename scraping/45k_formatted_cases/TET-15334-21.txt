•        
The Tenant entered into a tenancy agreement to rent a house located at 18 Norvalley Court with group of

The Tenant

(Tenant Exhibit #1) to Landlord

on July 18, 2019.
•        
The Tenant
submitted that she rented with a group. The group was
contacted by VC and told that the house
was flooded and NF
and the group would not be able to move in.
•        
Pursuant to the
tenancy agreement the Tenant with the group were to take possession of the rental unit on September 1,
2019.
•        
NF
testified that VC promised she could
move I September 1, 2019 however, because of flood that move in
date was extended and pushed to December
2019.
•

Legal Analysis
T1 Application: Rebate
of Money the Landlord Owes
 
3.     
NF
testified that on July 18, 2019
she signed a lease agreement
with the Landlord for a basement room and paid the Landlord a
$650.00 rent deposit.
 
4.     
Section 13 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, S.O. 2006, c.17
(‘Act’), states that a tenancy begins on
the day “the tenant is entitled to occupy the rental unit under the
tenancy agreement.” In this case, the
tenancy was to begin on September
1, 2019.
 
5.     
Subsection
107 of the Act provides that a landlord shall
repay the amount received as a rent deposit in respect
of a rental unit if vacant possession of the rental unit is not given
to the prospective tenant.
 
6.     
The
Act also states at section
135(1) that “a tenant or former tenant of a rental unit may
apply to the Board for an order that
the landlord, superintendent or agent of the landlord pay to the
tenant any money the person collected
or retained in contravention
of this Act.”
 
7.      It was uncontested based on
the tenant and her witness that the Landlord did not
give he tenant access
to the basement room of the rental unit because
of flood damage and was therefore unable to honour
the move in date of September
1, 2019.
 
8.     
Based on the
uncontested evidence before the
Board, I find that the Landlord collected a rent deposit from the Tenant
in the amount of $650.00 and was
unable to fulfill the tenancy agreement.
The Landlord did not allow the Tenant to move into the rental unit
and failed to return the full rent deposit in breach of the Act.
 
9.     
I find the Tenant
is entitled to a refund
of the rent deposit in the amount
of $650.00
 
10.  
The
Tenant has incurred the cost of $53.00 for filing the application and are entitled to reimbursement of those costs.




 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Landlord
shall pay to the Tenant
the sum of $650.00. This amount represents
$650.00 for the last month's rent deposit.
2.     
The Landlord
shall also pay to the Tenant $53.00
for the cost of filing the application.
3.     
If the
Landlord does not pay the Tenant the full amount owing by January
16, 2022, the Landlord will owe interest.
This will be simple interest calculated from January 17, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
4.     
The
Tenant has the right,
at any time, to collect the full
amount owing or any
balance outstanding under this order.
