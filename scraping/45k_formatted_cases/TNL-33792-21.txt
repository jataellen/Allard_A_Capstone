Landlords




 


and


 




 


Viana Betzoo


Tenant



 
Rashminder Paul Soor and Sukdeep Kaur Soor (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Viana
Betzoo (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
The Landlords also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
This application was heard via video/teleconference on November 18, 2021.
The Landlords, the Landlord's Legal Representative
Silvat Syed, the Tenant and the Tenant's Legal Representative Ricardo
Colonnese attended the hearing.
Landlord’s mother Karnail Kaur was present
and translators for the Tenant
were also in attendance to assist the Tenant.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     This is an application under section 48(1) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (Act).
 
2.     Subsection 48(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2006 (‘the Act’) which states in part:
“a landlord
may, by notice, terminate a tenancy if the landlord
in good faith requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation by
(a)  the landlord,
(b)  the landlord’s spouse, or
(c)  a child or parent
of the landlord or the landlord’s spouse.
 
3.    
On July 27, 2021 the Landlord sent
to the Tenant via courier to the address of the rental unit a (N12) Notice
to End the Tenancy setting out that the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the following reason.
•        
use by the Landlord and a parent of the Landlord.




 
4.    
The termination date in the (N12) notice was September 30, 2021.
5.    
The Tenant did not move out of the rental unit in accordance with the termination date set
out in the notice given.
6.    
The technical requirements for granting an application under section 48 of the Act are
(a)  
The Notice:
 
48(2) The date for termination specified in a notice shall be at least 60
days after the notice is given and shall be the day a period of the tenancy ends or,
where the tenancy is for a fixed
term, the end of the term.
(b)  
Declaration or Affidavit
 
Subsection 72(1) of the Act requires
the Landlord to file an affidavit/declaration sworn by
the person who personally requires the rental unit and that person certifying that they in good faith
requires the rental unit for his or her own personal use for at least one year.
(c)  
Compensation
 
Section 48.1 of the Act requires
a landlord who has served a tenant with an N12 notice pursuant to section 48 to pay
compensation to the tenants in an amount equal to one month’s rent.
Section 55.1 of
the Act requires the compensation must be paid no later than on the termination date specified in the N12 notice of termination given
by the Landlord under
section 48.
 
7.     The Landlord stated that the compensation was provided
to the Tenant in an amount equal to one month’s rent by placing
a cheque payable
to the Tenants dated September
11, 2021 in the unit mailbox where mail is delivered. To-date the Tenant by
choice has not tendered the compensation cheque.
 
8.     The Landlord filed three Declarations with the Board,
one by him, one from his spouse and another by Karnail Kaur (KK) the mother of the Landlord
affirming that they in good faith require the lower basement
rental unit for their collective personal use for at least one-year period.
 
9.     Based on the testimonies given and the documentary evidence
provided, on a balance of probabilities, I was satisfied the
technical requirements for granting an application under section 48 of the Act
were met.
 
10.  The Landlord requested a standard order to termination of the tenancy.
 
11.  The Tenant disputes
the good faith
intentions of the Landlord and his mother
for moving into that basement
rental unit because of the layout and stairs, as well as based on previous
discussions that the Landlord was going to sell. It was acknowledged those
discussions were from 2017 and 2018.




 
12.  The Landlords testified that they also live in and occupy
the upper level of the complex with their two children and his mother
that comprises of three bedrooms, one bathroom for a
family of 5. He further testified that his two children now 4 and 8 require their own separate
bedrooms. The lower basement unit comprises of two bedrooms, a bathroom and a
livingroom. It is the Landlord’s intent to reconfigure and effectively split
the living space of the upper and lower area to accommodate space for the
mother and the children.
13.  All in all, based on the totality of the testimonies
given by both parties, and all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance
with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
and find that it would
be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act. I was satisfied that the Landlord required
possession of the lower unit for personal use by him, his family and mother.
14.  The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,520.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period
from January 1, 2020.
 
15.  The order contains
all the reasons for the decision within
the order. No other reasons
will be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
February 28, 2022. The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before February 28, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$49.97 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
3.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2022, then starting
March 1, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
4.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 1, 2022.
