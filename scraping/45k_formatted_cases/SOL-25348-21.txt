Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-25348-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


207, 1001 MAIN STREET
W HAMILTON ON L8S1A9


 




Between:


Wilstar Management Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Hoeun Sam
Phan Sam Samnang
Sam


Tenants



 
 
 
Wilstar
Management Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Hoeun Sam, Phan Sam and Samnang
Sam (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the
rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 1, 2022. Only
the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Bryan Rubin, attended the hearing. As of
9:44 a.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022.
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective October 30, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in
possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent for the unit increased
to $1,332.76.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,295.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
1, 2021 to October 30, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenants paid $3,733.92 after
the application was filed.




 
7.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the parties and whether
the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 19, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $2,476.16*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to
February 8, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $43.30 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 9, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
19, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 20, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 19, 2022, then starting February
20, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 20, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before February 19,
2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $4,902.40** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.




 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion
to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 20, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.

unit is located.
