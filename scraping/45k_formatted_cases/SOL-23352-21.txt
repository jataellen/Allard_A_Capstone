Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-23352-21
 



In the
  matter of:


146 LINE 1 ROAD
NIAGARA-ON-THE-LAKE ON L0S1J0


 




Between:


Esther Tiedtke
  Heiko Tiedtke


Landlords




 


and


 




 


Abraham Peters
  Justina Peters


Tenants



 
 
Esther Tiedtke and Heiko Tiedtke (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Abraham
Peters and Justina Peters (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord requires possession
of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation for their child.
The Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in
the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on October 20, 2021.
 
Only the Landlords, represented by Judith Callender, attended the hearing.
The Tenants were not present or represented despite
being served with the notice of hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlords in good faith requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation for their child.
 
2.     On July 20, 2021 the Landlords gave the Tenants an N12
notice of termination for landlord’s own use. The termination date on the N12 notice is September 30, 2021.
 
3.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,200.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
4.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from March 9, 2015 to September 30, 2021
 
5.    
The Landlords paid the Tenants compensation equal to one month's rent on August
9, 2021 by cheque
and have complied
with subsection 55.1 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).
 
6.    
The Landlords met the requirements under section 72(1)(a)
of the Act by filing
with the Board an affidavit
sworn by the daughter of the Landlord, Sylvana Tiedtke, who




File Number: SOL-23352-21
 
personally requires
the rental unit certifying that she in good faith requires the rental unit for his own personal use for a
period of at least one year.
 
7.    
The Landlords also submitted into
evidence a copy of an N11 agreement dated September 18, 2021 that is signed
by both of the Landlords and both of the Tenants
with a termination date agreed upon as December 31, 2021.
 
8.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated, as of March 5, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the
rental unit on or before March 5, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $4,406.62, which
represents compensation for the use of the unit from October
1, 2021 to February 22, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the rent
deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $39.45 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from February 23, 2022 to
the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing on or before March 5, 2022, they will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from March 6,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 5, 2022, then starting
March 6, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after March 6, 2022.
