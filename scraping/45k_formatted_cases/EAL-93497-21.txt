Subsection 87(1)
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-93497-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


2008 MELETTE STREET ORLEANS ON K4A4X1


 




Between:


Audrey Hamel


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Tatiana Olshanskaya
  Vladimir Sakovets


Tenants



 
 
 
Audrey Hamel (the 'Landlord') applied for an order requiring
Tatiana Olshanskaya and Vladimir
Sakovets (the 'Tenants') to pay the rent that they owe.
 
This application
was heard by video conference on February 8, 2022. The Landlord and the Tenant, Vladimir
Sakovets, attended the hearing.
Determinations:
1.     The Tenants were in possession of the rental
unit on the date the application was filed.
 
2.     The Tenants did not pay the total rent they were required
to pay for the period
from November 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020.
 
3.     The monthly rent was $2,000.00.
 
4.     At the hearing,
the Landlord submitted
that the Tenants
gave notice at the end of October 2020 that they would be vacating
the rental unit. The Landlord stated that since 60 days is the proper notice
period, the Tenants should therefore be leaving by the end of December 2020 and
were responsible for the rent up to that date.
 
5.    
However, the Tenants did vacate
the rental unit on December 1, 2020 under the assumption that they had provided to the Landlord
another party to take over their lease. Unfortunately, that potential
renter did not pass the income and reference check conducted by the Landlord.
The Tenants vacated without confirmation that a suitable replacement was found.




File Number: EAL-93497-21
 
6.    
Since the Tenants left before the notice period had ended and did not find a replacement renter, I find that the
Tenants are still responsible for the rent owing for the month of December
2020.
 
7.    
This order contains all of the reasons in this matter
and no further reasons will be given.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlord $2,000.00, which represents the amount of rent
owing up to December 31, 2020.
 
2.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before February
28, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from March 1, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
