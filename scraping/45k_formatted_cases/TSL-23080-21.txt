Between:

and


 




 


Jose Manuel Santos
  Amorim


Tenant



 
Lucilia Ojeda and Antonio Araujo
(the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jose
Manuel Santos Amorim (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental
unit or a person the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has seriously impaired the safety of any person.
The Landlords also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
This application was heard via
video/teleconference on October
12, 2021.
Only the Landlords and the Landlord's Legal Representative Carlos
Oliveira attended the hearing.
 
As of 10:18 a.m.,
the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     On July 16, 2021 the Landlord gave the Tenant an
(N7) form notice to
end the tenancy setting out a termination date of
July 27, 2021.
 
2.     Section 66 of the Residential Tenancies Act provides:
(1) A landlord may give a tenant
notice of termination of the tenancy if, (a) an act or omission of the tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or
a person permitted
in the residential complex by the tenant seriously impairs or has seriously
impaired the safety of any person; and (b) the act or omission occurs in the residential
complex.
 
3.     Section 66 is intended to be used only where the misconduct is serious in nature.
The Act specifically uses the
adjective “seriously” for a reason as it refers to the nature of impairment of
safety. The use of that word means the provision is not intended to cover any
potential, contingent, or theoretical risk of harm.
 
4.     Section 66 entails
a short (10 day) notice
provision; no opportunity is provided to void the notice; and, if eviction is ordered,
the Sheriff must be requested to expedite it.




 
5.    
The Landlord’s testified that he
attended the residential complex on June 15, 2021, to follow up on a complaint lodged that the Tenant was intoxicated and was verbal
accosting passersby the Tenant’s rental unit.
 
6.     The Landlord asserted that when the Landlord arrived
at the property and approached the Tenant regarding the Tenant’s behaviour, the
Tenant began to argue with the Landlord and uttered
physical threats of harm. The Landlord called the police and asserts that the Tenant was arrested.
 
7.    
By doing so, the Landlord asserts
the Tenant seriously
impairs his safety
and the safety of other persons and this act or omission occurred in
the residential complex.
 
8.    
Section 264.1(1) of the Criminal Code states: “Everyone
commits an offence
who, in any manner, knowingly utters,
conveys or causes
any person to receive a threat (a) to cause death or serious bodily harm to any
person.
 
9.    
The essential
elements of a crime of threatening as described in s. 264.1 of the Criminal
Code is by the uttering of threats of death or serious bodily harm and the
words spoken or written as a threat to cause death or serious bodily harm; that
is, they were meant to intimidate or to be taken seriously.
 
10.  To determine if a reasonable person would consider
that the words were uttered as a threat I must regard them objectively; and
review them in light of the circumstances in which they were uttered,
the manner in which they were spoken,
and the person
to whom they were addressed.
 
11.  The Tenant did not attend
the hearing to make
submissions.
 
12.  Based on the uncontested testimony of the Landlord, I
find the verbal physical threat of harm to the Landlord seriously
impairs his safety
and the safety of other
persons and this act or omission occurred in the
residential complex.
 
13.  After having considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
14.  Section 84 of the Residential Tenancies Act provides
that:
 
Subject to clause 83 (1) (b), the Board shall, in an order based on a notice
given under section 66,
request that the sheriff expedite the enforcement of the order.
 
15.  The order contains
all the reasons for the decisions within
the order. No other reasons will be issued.




 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant
is terminated, as of February 20, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the
rental unit on or before February 20, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $4,532.97, which
represents compensation for the
use of the unit from July 28, 2021 to February 9, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $23.01 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from February 20, 2022 to
the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount
owing on or before February 20, 2022, the Tenant will start
to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 21, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 20, 2022, then starting February 21, 2022, the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant
possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after
February 21, 2022. The Sheriff
is requested to expedite the enforcement of this order.
