In the matter
of:


1 DOWNSTAIRS, 708 FIFTH STREET REMFREW ON K7V1G2


 




Between:


Hugh Stevenson Jayne Stevenson


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Kayla Lariviere


Tenant



 
 
 
Hugh Stevenson
and Jayne Stevenson (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Kayla Lariviere (the 'Tenant') because:
(a)    
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (the “L1
Application”); and,
(b)   the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex
has wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises. The Landlords has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenant
to compensate the Landlords
for the damage; and because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or
someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlords or another tenant (the “L2 Application”).
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on December
21, 2021 at 2:11 PM
 
The Landlords and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
Leanne Lariviere provided
evidence for the Tenant.
 
Determinations:
 
The L1 Application
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
August 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective May 24,
2021.




 
2.    
The Landlords collected a rent deposit of $650.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlords.
 
3.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 31, 2020 to May 24, 2021.
 
4.    
I am satisfied based
on the evidence of electronic submission receipt provided by the
Landlord that the application was filed with the Board on June 4, 2021, although
not processed until July 12, 2021. The
Tenant was in possession of the unit at
that time.
 
5.    
The Tenant paid
$4,602.00 after the application was filed. As
the rent due January 1, 2022 was due after the hearing, I cannot make a determination if it was paid. The order
for payment assumes that it has not been paid, but any amounts previously paid for rent due for January 1, 2022 to date must
be credited against the amounts due.
 
6.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until
March 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. The arrears relate
to rent due April 1, 2021 and earlier, and the Tenant has since that time made
regular rent payments. Having regard
to the Tenant’s family situation of having three children, the additional time
affords her a longer opportunity to void the order, or else find alternate
accommodation. As the rent payments
are being made (and are subject to a separate
prompt-payment order from a previous
L2/N8 application), I see
no prejudice to the Landlord that would rise to the level of unfairness in
granting this delay.
 
The L2 Application
 
7.    
The Landlord’s application
seeks eviction of the Tenant for substantially interfering with a lawful right,
privilege or interest
of the Landlord, and also the Tenant,
another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused undue
damage to the premises. The
application is rooted in a single N5 notice of termination, made under sections
62 and 64 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”), which was
served on the Tenant on May 9, 2021 with a termination date of May 31, 2021.
 
8.    
The N5 makes numerous
allegations under both headings of substantial interference and damage. I shall
address those two aspects separately.
 
Substantial Interference




 
9.    
A Landlord
may serve a notice of termination under section 64 of the Act if the Tenant, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlords or another tenant.
 
10. 
On claims
that relate to substantial interference, the events in the N5 can be stated as follows:
(a)  
Litter consistently strewn throughout the back yard and on the back porch
(b)  
Dog faeces attracting complaints from neighbours
(c)   Numerous instances of denial
of entry to inspectors where proper notice had been given under the Act.
(d)  
Unauthorized burning
outside of the rental unit on August
14, 2021
 
11. 
Subsection 64 (3)
of the Act provides that a notice given under section 64 “is void if the
tenant, within seven days after receiving the notice, stops the conduct or
activity or corrects the omission” in relation to the objectionable behaviour
found in the notice. In other words,
if the Tenant ceases the objectionable activity
within seven days of receiving the notice, the notice cannot
sustain an eviction on the basis of that activity that was complained of. In this instance, the “voiding period” ran
until May 16, 2021.
 
12. 
The Landlord
has objected to the Tenant’s
accumulation of garbage
in the back yard and porch. Photographs submitted by the Landlord show an accumulation of
items. The Landlord notes that this lack of cleanliness is impairing their
ability to rent another vacant unit. Given the impact on the Landlord, I find that the Tenant’s
accumulation of garbage is substantially interfering wit h the Landlord’s
lawful right and interest in renting other units.
 
13. 
The complaints from neighbours about dog faeces are not properly brought
ender section 64 of the Act,
as the Landlord must show that the events noted in the N5 substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlords or another tenant. Mere complaints from neighbours are immaterial, and no further interference is alleged on the notice. The dog faeces cannot sustain an eviction.
 
14. 
The Landlord
conceded that there was no denial of entry during
the voiding period.
The Tenant voided this portion of the notice.
 
15. 
The Landlord has
not demonstrated how the unauthorized burning was in itself a substantial interference with any lawful
right of the Landlord. This ground cannot
sustain an eviction.
 
Undue damage




 
16. 
A Landlord
may serve a notice of termination under section 62 of the Act if the Tenant, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or
negligently caused undue damage to the premises
 
17.  On claims in the N5 that relate
to damage, the events can be stated
as follows:
 
(a)  
$4,200 damage caused by a flood from a clogged sump pump on April 3,
2018.
(b)   Damage to basement drywall caused by
the wall apparently being punched, the damage
being discovered by the Landlord
in October 2018 and resulting in $200 in damage.
(c)   Damage to a window
on the night of October
12-13, 2019 caused by a guest to the
residential complex throwing
a chair through the window,
causing $550 in damage.
(d)   Damage to a basement
door discovered on August 14, 2020, which
will cost $300 to replace.
 
18. 
A notice under
section 62 is voided in a similar manner to a notice under section 64 if,
within seven days following the notice, the Tenant arranges to repair the
damaged property or pay to the landlord the reasonable costs of repairing
the damaged property,
or to replace the damaged property or pay to the landlord the reasonable
costs of replacing the damaged property, if it is not reasonable to repair the
damaged property. It was uncontested
that the Tenant did not void this portion of the notice.
 
19. 
On all of the
foregoing matters, the Landlord also applied under section 89 of the Act for
their out-of-pocket expenses to repair or replace the unduly damaged property. The amounts claimed are noted above. The Landlord provided
no invoices, receipts,
or third- party estimates of
these costs therefore compensation has not been awarded
 
20. 
As to the sump pump damage of April 3, 2018, the
Landlord presented no evidence other than their supposition in oral
testimony that the Tenant, other occupant, or guest caused the damage. The Landlord has not proven this event as
a ground for eviction.
 
21. 
As to the damaged
wall discovered in October 2018, I find based on photographs submitted by the Landlord
that the damage was undue and could
have been caused only through a negligent or wilful act. As the event occurred in the unit after
the Tenant took possession, I am satisfied on a balance
of probabilities that the Tenant,
another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex caused
the damage.
 
22. 
For the damaged
window in 2019, the Tenant’s testimony was that the damage was caused by a
non-occupant who was not allowed on the premises by her. The Landlord had no rebuttal. To sustain a ground for eviction, undue
damage must be caused by the
Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in
the




 
residential complex.
The Landlord has not proven that the damage was caused by any of those three classes of individuals. The event therefore cannot sustain an
eviction.
 
23. 
As to the damaged
to the basement door discovered in August 14, 2020, I find based on photographs submitted by the Landlord that the damage was undue and could have been
caused only through a negligent or wilful act.
As the event occurred in the unit after the Tenant took possession, I am
satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Tenant, another occupant of
the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex
caused the damage. .
 
24. 
The Tenant, or an
occupant of the rental unit, or a person permitted in the residential complex by the Tenant
has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit by damaging a wall and door as
descried above.
 
25. 
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction subject to the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act.
 
26. 
The damage proven
by the Landlord is minor, and there appear to have been no repeat occurrences
in some time. The N5 was served in
May 2021, yet the most recent event complained of on it (other than recurring
garbage) is October 27, 2020. The
damage is old news. Had the Landlord
proven its out-of-pocket expense, I would have considered an award of compensation a full answer
to the complaints. In the absence of such proof, I see no grounds to impose a
remedy.
 
27.  The
Landlord has noted
however that the garbage is interfering with their ability
to rent another unit. A conditional order is in my view therefore appropriate to require that the
Tenant remove garbage from common areas, and not allow it to accumulate
It is ordered that:
 
In
the L1 Application:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before
March 31, 2022.
 
2.     The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $7,692.77*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 25, 2022, less
the rent deposit and interest the
Landlords owe on the rent deposit.




 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlords $25.22
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 26, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before February
5, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 6, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 31, 2022, then starting April 1, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after April 1, 2022.
 
8.     If
the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlords or to the Board in
trust:
i)               
$7,871.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$9,405.00 if the payment
is made on or before
March 31, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full
payment in accordance with this
paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may
make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after
April 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlords.
 
In
the L2 Application
 
10.  On or before March 31, 2022, the
Tenant shall remove all garbage and unused personal items from common areas
of the residential complex
(including the porch
and back yard).
 
11. 
For the duration of the tenancy from April 1, 2022 onward, the Tenant shall not store any
garbage or unused personal items in the common areas of the residential complex
(including the porch and back yard), and store any garbage only in the areas so
designated for garbage storage.
 
12.  If
the Tenant breaches
the provisions contained
in paragraphs 10 or 11 of this order, the Landlord may apply under section 78 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, without




 
notice to the
Tenant, for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord must make any such application no later than thirty days after any such
breach of the provisions contained in paragraphs 10 or 11 of this order.
