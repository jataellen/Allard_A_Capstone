Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-15637-18
 











 

LVC. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict NN (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes (L1 application).
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the
termination date (L2 application).
 
This application was heard in [CITY] on June 13,
2018.  The Landlord’s Legal Representative, PS, and the Landlord’s Agent, DG,
attended the hearing.  As of 11:20 a.m., the Tenant was not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board. 
 
Determinations:

1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from March 1, 2018 to
June 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective April 3, 2018.

of the rental unit.

L2 application – Tenant has Substantially Interfered

Incidents Detailed in the First N5 Notice
 
6.     
A Notice to End the
Tenancy for Interfering with Others (Form N5) was served on the Tenant on October
25, 2017.  The notice alleges that the Tenant has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. 
The Landlord’s Agent testified to the incidents outlined in the first N5
Notice.
7.     
The Landlord’s Agent testified
that between August 2017 and October 2017, the Tenant’s next-door neighbour
made numerous complaints about the Tenant and her guests harassing the
neighbour, trespassing on and interfering with her property, interfering with
her vehicle, vandalizing her property and allowing a dog to roam off-leash on
her property.  The neighbour showed the Landlord’s Agent video camera footage
of some of the events.  
8.     
After service of the first
N5 notice, the Landlord did not receive any new complaints from the neighbour
or other residents about the conduct of the Tenant or her guests. 
Incidents Detailed in the Second N5 Notice 
 
9.     
The second Notice to End
the Tenancy for Interfering with Others (Form N5) was served on the Tenant
on March 19, 2018.  The notice alleges that the Tenant has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. 
The Landlord’s Agent testified to the incidents outlined in the second N5
Notice.  
10.  
The Landlord’s Legal
Representative produced a Board order, SWL-08244-17 issued on November 16,
2017.  In SWL-08244-17, the presiding Member found that the Tenant had altered
the locking system on a door giving entry to the rental unit without the
Landlord's consent, and failed to give the Landlord a replacement key.  The
Tenant was ordered to provide a replacement key to the Landlord.
11.  
The Landlord’s Agent
testified that the Tenant did give him a replacement key for the Tenant’s unit. 
However, in February 2018, after providing the Tenant with proper written
notice of entry, when the Landlord’s Agent attempted to enter the Tenant’s
rental unit, the key did not fit the lock.  The Landlord’s Agent then tried to
use the master key, and that key also did not fit the lock.
12.  
The Landlord’s Agent
testified that he has tried to communicate with the Tenant and request a
working key to the rental unit, but the Tenant refuses to engage in
conversation with the Landlord’s Agent.  The Landlord’s Agent attended the
Tenant’s rental unit again on the morning of the hearing, after providing
proper written notice of entry, to re-test the key.  The Landlord’s Agent
testified that he saw an adult female who he believed to be the Tenant in the
rental unit as he approached the front door.  Despite knocking on the door for
several minutes, no-one came to the door.  The Landlord’s Agent tried both the
key provided by the Tenant and his master key, and was unable to unlock the
Tenant’s rental unit.
13.  
The Landlord’s Agent
testified that the Landlord has not been able to enter the Tenant’s rental unit
since the summer of 2017.  As a result, the Landlord has not been able to
complete routine tasks in the rental unit such as conducting annual
maintenance, testing the smoke alarms or testing the furnace.
Analysis:
 
14.  
The first N5 notice was
served pursuant to section 64 the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (‘the
Act’).  That section sets out that a landlord can give a notice of termination
if the conduct of the tenant is such that it substantially interferes with the
reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex for all usual purposes by the
landlord or another tenant or substantially interferes with another lawful
right, privilege or interest of the landlord or another tenant.  That section also
provides that the notice of termination is voided if the tenant stops the
offending conduct during the seven days following the service of the notice; in
this case from October 26 to November 1, 2017.
15.  
The Landlord’s Agent testified
that after the first N5 notice was served, he received no new complaints about
the Tenant’s conduct.  I am satisfied that the Tenant voided the first Form N5.

16.  
The second N5 notice was
served pursuant to section 68 of the Act. That section entitles the Landlord to
serve a non-voidable N5 if the Tenant voided the first N5 and within the
following six months there is another incident.  As there is no ability to void
second N5 notices, the Landlord was entitled to file the application to evict
the Tenant.
17.  
I accept the uncontested
testimony of the Landlord’s Agent, and find that the Landlord proved, on a
balance of probabilities, that the Tenant and her guests have substantially
interfered with the Landlord's and the other tenants' reasonable enjoyment of
the residential complex by harassing the Tenant’s neighbour, and that the
Tenant has interfered with the lawful rights of the Landlord by disregarding an
order of the Board by not providing the Landlord with a working replacement key
to her rental unit. 
Relief from Eviction:
 
18.  
Having found the Landlord
has proven the allegations in its application, I will turn my mind to relief
from eviction, as required under section 83 of the Act.  
19.  
The Landlord’s Agent
testified that the Tenant was advised several months ago that the rental unit
key she provided was not working, and yet she refuses to communicate with the
Landlord to resolve this issue.  The Tenant’s actions are preventing the
Landlord from meeting his obligations to repair and maintain the rental unit as
required under section 20 of the Act.  Considering this and all other disclosed
circumstances, I find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.  
20.  
This order contains all of
the reasons for this matter, and no other reasons will issue.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before June 25, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $2,673.99*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to June 14, 2018.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $31.96 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
June 15, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 25, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June 26,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 25, 2018, then starting June 26, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 26, 2018.
