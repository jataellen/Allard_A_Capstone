Order under Section 135
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNT-32065-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


9 WATFIVE STREET BRAMPTON ON L7A4S1


 




Between:


Josaih Craig


Tenant




 


and


 




 


Mahi Ali Jamal


Landlord



 
 
 
Josaih Craig (the 'Tenant') applied for an order determining that Mahi Ali Jamal (the 'Landlord')
has collected or retained money illegally.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 17,
2022.
 
Only the Tenant attended the
hearing. As of 1:35 p.m., the Landlord was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     For the reasons that follow, I find that the Landlord
collected a rent deposit from the Tenant. However, the Landlord did not allow the Tenant
to move into the rental
unit and failed to return the
rent deposit. This is prohibited by the Act. I further find that the Landlord
failed to pay the Tenant interest on last month's deposit, as required by the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').
 
2.     The Tenant testified that he was supposed to move into
the rental unit on September 1, 2020; on August 11, 2021 the Landlord emailed
him with the standard form lease. The email said the lease offer was not active
until the first and last month rent had been received. The Tenant e-transferred
the Landlord $900.00 on August 10, 2020; $450 for the last month rent deposit and $450.00 for the first
month’s rent. The Tenant
also signed the lease and
returned it to the Landlord. The lease and copy of the e-transfer were entered
into evidence; the Tenant did not keep a copy of the signed lease.
 
3.    
The Tenant also
testified that on Monday, August 31, 2020, he phoned the Landlord and was told
the Landlord needed until Friday, September 4, 2020 to get the unit ready. On
Thursday September 3rd the Tenant phoned again; the Landlord
said that the previous tenant had still not vacated,
and he needed until Wednesday, September 9th. On Tuesday September 8th the Tenant called the Landlord and was again told the previous
tenant had not vacated, therefore the Landlord needed until Friday September 11th. The morning of Friday, September 11th the Landlord said the other tenant was still there and he
needed




 
until Monday, September 14th. On Saturday,
September 15th the Tenant called the Landlord and
told him he could not wait any longer to move in; the Landlord said he would send his last month rent deposit and first month’s
rent back within
72 hours. The Tenant did not receive the money, not
did he ever receive the keys to the rental unit.
 
Analysis
 
4.     Section 107 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) says a “landlord shall repay
the amount received as a rent deposit in respect of a rental unit if vacant
possession of the rental unit is not given to the prospective tenant”.
 
5.    
Section 106(10)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’) says a “landlord shall apply a rent deposit that a tenant
has paid to the landlord or to a former landlord in payment of the rent for the
last rent period before the tenancy terminates”.
 
6.    
Here, based
on the uncontested evidence and testimony, the Tenant paid the Landlord the first month’s rent and the
last month rent deposit and returned to him the signed lease. Therefore, I find section
107 does not apply as there is a tenancy
agreement, as such he is a
Tenant not a prospective tenant.
 
7.     I also find that by not giving the Tenant keys or
possession of the unit, the Landlord’s actions are the equivalent to an illegal
eviction. Section 134(c) of the Act forbids Landlords from charging more than the lawful rent. Here,
as the Landlord did not use the first month rent for the month of
September, I consider it be illegal rent that the Tenant has paid/been charged
for.
 
8.    
Although the
Tenant included the $450.00 for the first month rent under the last month rent
deposit amount, I find I can award it under the above-mentioned section 134 of
the Act. This is not contrary
to Beauge v. Metcap Living
Management Inc., 2012 ONSC 1160, where the Divisional Court said the
Board has no jurisdiction to award damages unless a request for damages is made
in the application or the respondent is given notice and an opportunity to
respond to a request to amend the application. Here the damages amount
requested remains the same, it is merely being awarded under a different
section of the Act.
 
9.    
Therefore, based on the above, the Tenant is entitled to both the first month rent back and the last month rent deposit, for
a total of $900.00. An order will issue for same.
 
10. 
With respect
to the last month rent deposit, section
106(6) of the Act says (6)
a “landlord of a rental unit
shall pay interest to the tenant annually
on the amount of the rent deposit at a rate equal to the guideline determined
under section 120 that is in effect at the time payment becomes due”.




 
11.  Here, the Landlord has retained the last month rent
deposit in the amount of $450.00 since August 10, 2020 without
properly ending the tenancy. Therefore, I find the Landlord is liable for interest on that
deposit to the date of hearing in the amount of $4.58, calculated as follows. He Board does not have the jurisdiction to order interest
on the first month rent that was retained by the Landlord.
 
August 10, 2020 to December 31, 2020 = 143 days
2020 is 2.2% X $450.00 = $9.90 ÷ 365 days/year = $0.027 per diem
143 X $0.027 = $3.86
January 1, 2021 to December 31,
2021
No interest payable based on rent freeze January 1, 2022 to February 17, 2022 = 48 days
1.2% X $450.00 = $5.40 ÷ 365 days/year = $0.015
$0.015 X 48 days = $.72
 
$3.86 + $0.72 = $4.58
 
 
12.  As the Tenant
was successful in his application, he is entitled
to reimbursement of the
application filing fee.
 
13.  This order contains
all the reasons for the decision within
it. No further reasons shall be
issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord shall pay to the Tenant
the sum of $904.58.
This amount represents $4.58 for interest on the last
month's rent deposit and $900.00 collected for a rent deposit and the
first month’s rent deposit that was collected illegally.
 
2.     The Landlord shall also pay to the Tenant $53.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
3.     The total amount
the Landlord owes to the Tenant is $957.58.
 
4.     If the Landlord does not pay the Tenant the full
amount owing by March 8, 2022, the Landlord
will owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 9, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the outstanding
balance.
 
5.     The Tenant has the right,
at any time, to collect
the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
