In the matter
of:


272, 7555 GOREWAY DRIVE MISSISSAUGA ON L4T2T2


 




Between:


Siteline (7555 Goreway) Inc.


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Devaroo
Anderson


Tenant



 
On November 8,
2021, Siteline (7555 Goreway) Inc. (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Devaroo Anderson (the
'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes
because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on September
27, 2021 with respect to application CEL-00710-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant if
the Tenant did not meet certain
condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed
to pay to the Landlord
$988.37 on or before November
1, 2021 towards rent. The Tenant paid $487.74
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for
the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $2,000.00 for rent arrears in Order CEL-00710-21. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $1,499.37 and that amount is included
in this order. As a result,
the previous order CEL-00710-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $988.37 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from August 1, 2018 to January 4, 2022.




File Number: CEL-04069-21
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Order CEL-00710-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 15, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$971.05*. This amount
represents the rent owing up to November 30, 2021, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$32.49 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting December 1, 2021 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
15, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after January 16, 2022.

The tenant has until January 14, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 14, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.
 
In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on July 16, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date
