Shian Wang


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Franco
Cinelli John Nguyen


Tenants



 
 
 
Shian Wang (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Franco Cinelli
and John Nguyen (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord requires possession of the
rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 663 715 624# on November
17, 2020. The Landlord’s
representative Pewiei Ni, and the Tenant Franco Cinelli, represented by Jessica
Fletcher, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     Subsequent to filing this application with
the Board in 2020, the Landlord served another N12 notice for landlord’s own use, filed application TNL-24205-20 which has been heard.
 
2.    
Considering the fact the merits of the application already heard by the Board are the same there is no need to proceed with
this application.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord's application is dismissed.
