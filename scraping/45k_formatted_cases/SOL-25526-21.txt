IMH Pool VI-A LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Shawn Paterson (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 8, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative,
Frank Calcagni, attended the hearing. As of 10:29 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from September 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 27, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on November
30, 2021. The Tenant was in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,724.99.
 
4.    
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant paid $1,724.99 after the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of November
30, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$1,774.90*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to November 30, 2021.




File Number: SOL-25526-21
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 25, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
