Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Steven Nelson


Tenant



 
 
 
2756475 Ontario Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Steven
Nelson (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord intends to do major repairs or
renovations to the rental unit. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the
unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by video conference
on December 20, 2021.
 
At 1:37 pm, the Landlord
Ian Mason (IM) and the Landlord’s Representative Monique Laderoute (ML)
attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations and Reasons:
 
1.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
2.     The rental unit is in a
mixed-use complex with commercial tenants
occupying the main floor and three residential units on
the second floor. The Tenant’s lives
in a three- bedroom unit.
 
3.     The tenancy began
in or around April 2016.
 
4.     The Landlord’s L2 application
was preceded by a N13 notice of termination (‘N13
notice’) deemed served September 29, 2021. The Landlord is seeking termination of tenancy based on
extensive renovation and repairs that require the Landlord to obtain a building
permit and the rental unit must be vacant to do the work. The date of
termination in the N12 notice is January 31, 2021.




 
 
 
Landlord’s Evidence:
 
5.    
The Landlord
has compensated the Tenant
in the amount of one months rent as
per s.52(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).
 
6.     It was the testimony of the Landlord that he offered
right of first refusal to the Tenant following
completion of the renovations as per s.53(1)
of the Act, but the Tenant did not
respond.
 
7.    
The Landlord
testified that, until
he purchased this property in or around
November 2020, he had not
served any tenants with N13 notices of termination as per s.73(2) of the Act.
 
8.     It was the testimony and evidence of the Landlord that
he purchased the property knowing there were outstanding work orders with respect to fire prevention issues as per the Fire
Prevention Office. The inspection order includes: work to the brick wall,
foundation, ceiling, plumbing between the main floor and second floor units,
testing for asbestos, smoke alarm installation, illuminated exit signs,
emergency lighting, door latching, carbon monoxide detectors, working closure
and installation of fire door.
 
9.    
The Landlord further testified and provided evidence by way of inspection reports
and other documentation that the structural issues and required tasks necessitates vacant possession of the rental unit.
 
10.  The Landlord further testified and provided evidence
that he had applied for applicable permits and is working closely
with the area Fire Prevention Officer (FPO). The FPO has provided an extension to the order to
January 11, 2022 due to covid and resulting delay with the project. The Landlord testified that should the
termination of tenancy not be granted; the Fire Department might close the
building permanently due to the unsafe condition of the facility. The Landlord also expressed liability
concerns in the event any tenants were negatively impacted due to the unsafe
conditions within the complex.
 
Law and Analysis:
 
11.  The N13 was served pursuant
to s.50 of the Act which states:
 
(1)   A landlord may give notice
of termination of a tenancy
if the landlord requires
possession of the rental unit in order to,
 
(a)    
demolish it;
(b)    
convert it to use for a purpose other than residential premises; or
(c)     do
repairs or renovations to it that are so extensive that they require
a building permit and vacant possession of the rental
unit.
12. 
 It was the uncontested evidence of the Landlord that the
he is required to do the
work as laid out in paragraph 8 and
that the work requires the Tenant to vacate the unit.




 
 
 
 
13.  Based on the evidence and testimony before
me, I am satisfied the work required in the
rental unit requires the Landlord to
have vacant possession. I am also satisfied that the Landlord has taken the necessary steps to secure
permits for the project.
 
14.  I am satisfied on the totality of the submission of
the Landlord that the Landlord intends, in good faith, to carry out the
renovations as required by s.73(a) of the Act.
This is evident by the fact that the Landlord has already started work on the residential complex and is working
with the FPO to ensure successful completion of the project. Additionally, I am satisfied that the
Landlord provided the required compensation to the Tenant and offered the
Tenant first refusal of the unit upon completion of the project.
 
15.  I am also satisfied that the Landlord
has and/or will obtain the necessary permits
for the work as mandated by s.73(b) of the Act.
 
16. 
I find that the Landlord requires
the rental unit to
be vacated in order to do major repairs
or renovations to the rental unit.
 
Section 83
Considerations:
 
 
17.  The Tenant did not attend
the hearing to defend his
position.
 
18.  It has been a
lengthy tenancy.
 
19.  The Landlord is not aware of any reasons to delay or deny eviction.
 
20.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of
the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find
that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
21.

for the decision within it. No further
reasons shall be issued.
