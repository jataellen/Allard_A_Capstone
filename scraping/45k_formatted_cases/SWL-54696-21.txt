Paul Krzic (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ron MacQueen
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 20, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Chris Surowiak,
attended the hearing. As of 10:27 a.m., the Tenant was not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      
The Tenant
was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $660.00.
 
4.     The Tenant paid all arrears for the period
ending December 31, 2021, after the application was filed.
 
5.     The only amount outstanding is the Landlord's cost of filing the application. As a result, the order will be limited to
costs only and not eviction.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
