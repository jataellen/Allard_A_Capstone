Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006


 




 


File Number:
NOL-44386-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
1216 HOWEY DRIVE SUDBURY ON P3B1H5


 




Between:


Richard Thibert


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Dennis
Farmer


Tenant



 
 
 
Richard Thibert
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dennis
Farmer (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord has entered into an agreement of purchase and sale
of the rental unit and the purchaser requires possession of the rental unit for
the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation
for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on December 6, 2021.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord's Legal Representative, Lee-Anne
Thibert, and the Tenant attended the hearing. Matt Christonson
(‘MC’) also attended the hearing as a witness for the Landlord.
 
Determinations:
 
Adjournment request
 
1.    
At the outset of the hearing,
the Tenant requested
an adjournment because
his retained counsel was not
available to attend the hearing. The adjournment request was denied because the
Tenant's Legal Representative had not sent any request to the Board or to the
Landlord’s Legal Representative requesting an adjournment or rescheduling of
the hearing. In addition, the Landlord's Legal Representative indicated that
the property is sold and the closing has already been extended. Adjourning the
matter would result in undue prejudice to the Landlord.
 
L2 application
 
2.    
Joann Catherin Jackson-Fry
and Samuel Jackson Fry (the ‘Purchasers’) have an Agreement of Purchase and Sale (‘APS’)
for the purchase of the residential complex.
A copy of the APS dated August 15, 2021 was tendered as evidence (Tab D,
Landlord’s Evidence Brief).




File Number: NOL-44386-21
 
3.    
The Landlord
paid the Tenant
one month’s rent compensation in accordance with subsection 49.1 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).
 
4.    
The Landlord
filed copies of the Purchasers’ declarations (Tab E, Landlord’s Evidence Brief).
 
5.    
The remaining
issue to determine
is whether the Purchaser’s in good faith requires
possession of the residential complex for the purpose of residential
occupation.
 
6.    
For the following reasons,
the Board finds
that the Landlord
has led insufficient evidence
to establish that the Purchaser’s in good faith requires possession of the
residential complex for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
7.    
The Tenant contests
that the Purchasers’ intentions to move into the residential complex for purposes
of residential occupation. According to the Tenant, the residential complex
is in disarray which casts doubt on the Purchasers’ intention to live in
the residential complex.
 
8.    
The Purchasers were not present
at the hearing to give evidence about their intention. I give little weight to the Purchasers’ declarations and to MC’s
testimony about the Purchasers’ intentions because this evidence is hearsay.
 
9.    
On the basis of the
evidence presented at the hearing, I am not satisfied that the Purchasers in good faith require possession of the residential complex for purpose
of residential occupation.
 
10. 
Therefore, the Landlord’s application must be dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord's application is dismissed.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay back $1,500.00 to the Landlord,
representing the one month’s rent compensation given to the Tenant.
