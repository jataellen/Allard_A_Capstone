In the
  matter of:


474 MISTY CRESCENT KITCHENER ON N2B3V6


 




Between:


Martine Thomas


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Dakota
Rochead Nicole Golden


Tenants



 
 
 
Martine Thomas (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Nicole Golden and Dakota Rochead (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 6, 2022.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Jane Dean, and the Tenants
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from March 1, 2021 to May 31,
2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective May 12, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
were in possession of the rental
unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.    
The Landlord’s Legal Representative submitted
that the Tenants
vacated the rental
unit on July 24, 2021.
 
4.    
The lawful
monthly rent was
$1,800.00.
 
5.    
The Landlord
incurred costs of $186.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
 
6.    
The Landlord
is not holding a rent deposit.
 
7.    
The amount
outstanding to July 31, 2021, inclusive of rent arrears,
and costs, is
$8,036.00.

8.    
The Tenants, however,
submitted that the Landlord had changed the locks to the rental unit on July 1, 2021 and therefore, their tenancy was deemed ended by the Landlord on that date.
 
9.    
The Landlord
admitted that she thought the rental unit was empty on June 30, 2021 given
that the Tenants had a moving truck at the unit and were proceeding to pack up
and leave. The Landlord then confirmed that the locks were changed after the
Tenants had left.
 
10. 
The Tenants
added that they returned to the rental
unit on July 1, 2021 only to find that the locks were changed without their
knowledge. They also stated that the police were called and that the Landlord
was charged due to an altercation.
 
11.  The Landlord did confirm to being charged
by the police.
 
12.  The Landlord’s Legal
Representative replied that the Tenants
were then still around for most of July and had some of their
possessions still in the unit July 24, 2021.
 
13.  Given the contentious nature of this tenancy and the facts presented at the hearing,
I find that June 30, 2021 is
a very fair compromise as the end date of this tenancy.
 
14.  This order contains
all of the reasons in this matter
and no further reasons will be issued.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of June
30, 2021, the compromise date the Tenants
gave vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$6,059.96*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to June 30, 2021.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
27, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 28, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
