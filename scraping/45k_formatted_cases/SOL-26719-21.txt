Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Elizabeth Eyre-baker
  Gabrielle Yee


Tenants



 
 
 
Interrent C/o Clv Group (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Gabrielle Yee and Elizabeth
Eyre-baker (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay compensation for damage they owe
because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by
the Board on August 24, 2021 with respect to application SOL-21981-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Board issued
an order pertaining to file number
SOL-21981-21 on August
24, 2021 which required the
Tenants to make a payment to the Landlord of $10, 810.00 on or before September
11, 2021. This payment represented the reasonable costs of repairing/replacing
damage property.
 
2.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the
Tenants to terminate the tenancy
and evict the Tenants if the Tenants did not meet certain conditions specified in the order.
 
3.    
Pursuant to subsection 78(5)
of the Act, an application made under section
78 must be filed no later than 30 days after the
breach of the order.
 
4.    
Within the subject L4 application the Landlord claims
that the Tenants
had not met the following
condition as set out in the order:
 
▪ 
On or before September 11, 2021, the Tenants shall
pay to the Landlord
$10,      810.00,      which     represents      the     reasonable              costs          of repairing/replacing the damaged property
 
5.     The Landlord’s application was received by the Board
on December 14, 2021, which, pursuant to subsectiion 78 (5) of the Act, is more than 30 days after the Tenants
failed to




File Number: SOL-26719-21
 
meet a condition set out in the
order SOL-21981-21 dated August 24, 2021. The first alleged breach would have been in relation to the September
11, 2021 payment
of $10, 810.00.
 
6.     The Board does not have jurisdiction to consider this application as it was filed beyond the statutory 30-day period after
the alleged breach had taken place.
 
7.     As the Landlord’s application does not meet the statutory requirements under subsections 78(5) of the Act, the application is
dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application under section 78 of the Act is dismissed.
