Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-25336-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


10, 2 BALSAM AVENUE
S HAMILTON ON L8M3B1


 




Between:


Jubilee Apartments


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Ticuis Taylor


Tenant



 
 
 
Jubilee Apartments (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ticuis Taylor (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on February 1, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Elaine Page, attended
the hearing. As of 11:02 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from August 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective August 21, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,650.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord sold the rental property
on November 1, 2021. As a result,
this order will be
limited to arrears and costs up to October 31, 2021 only, not eviction.
 
 
 
It is
ordered that:
 
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$5,136.00, which represents the amount of rent
owing ($4,950.00) and costs ($186.00).




File Number: SOL-25336-21
 
2.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
February 18, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
