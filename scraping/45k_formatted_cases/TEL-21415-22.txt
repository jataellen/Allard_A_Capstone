  matter of:


E1, 240 ORMOND
DRIVE OSHAWA ON L1G6T5


 




Between:


Durham Region
Non-profit Housing Corp.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Austin Dwyer


Tenant



 
 
 
Durham Region Non-profit Housing
Corp. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Austin Dwyer (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent
the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the Board on January 5, 2022 with
respect to application TEL-19231-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $321.66 arrears
on or before January 25, 2022. The Tenant did not pay $1080.00 rent on or before
February 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $2,529.98 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order TEL-19231-21. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $1,929.98 and that amount
is included in this order. As a result, the previous order TEL-19231-21 is
cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from January 1, 2022 to February 28, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,044.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from January 1, 2021 to
February 22, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order TEL-19231-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before March 5, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
pay to the Landlord $1,696.07*. This amount represents the rent owing up to February 22, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $35.51 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 23, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March 5, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from March 6, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 5, 2022, then starting March
6, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 6, 2022.
 
 
February 22, 2022

The tenant has until March 4, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by March 4,
2022 the order will be stayed and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on September 6, 2022

Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
