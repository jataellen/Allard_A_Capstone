and


 




 


Ricardo Larromana


Tenant



 
 
 
Benstar Limited Partnership (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ricardo
Larromana (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard by Videoconference
on January 13, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Stephanie Lauersen, attended the hearing. As of 9:38 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from August 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 5, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on December
31, 2021. The Tenant was in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent was $2,276.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,284.22 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from July 29, 2021 to
September 5, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $3,487.50 after the application was filed.




File Number: HOL-12098-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of December
31, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,606.28*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to December
31, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 28, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
