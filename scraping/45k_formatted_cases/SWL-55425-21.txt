Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55425-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


ROOM 08, 552 CAMPBELL AVE.
AVENUE WINDSOR ON N9B2H4


 




Between:


Yuanming Yu


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Michelle Timothy


Tenant



 
 
 
Yuanming Yu (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Michelle Timothy (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for
each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard via video conference on January 24, 2022.
Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The residential complex is a house with two floors. The Landlord resides in a self- contained unit on the main floor with one tenant
while the Tenant and another
tenant rent a room in the
basement and share a kitchen and a bathroom. The Tenant moved into the rental
unit in July, 2021 and it is a month to month tenancy.
 
2.     For the reasons
that follow, the Landlord’s application is dismissed.
 
3.     The Landlord served the first N5 notice on the Tenant
on August 23, 2021 with a termination date of September 30, 2021. The allegations noted
in the first N5 notice are:
 
•        
On August 22, 2021 between
8:00a.m. to 8:00 p.m., the Tenant talked to herself loudly, laughed and coughed
loudly inside her room or in the backyard or front porch. The Tenant made a lot of noise
which severely disturbed the Landlord and
other tenant. It was alleged that the
Tenant smoked inside the house




 
•        
on some days during the month of
July and August , the Tenant forgot
to bring her key and bothered the Landlord to open the door in the middle of
the night. The Tenant smoked a couple
of times inside the house which made the Landlord very uncomfortable. The
Tenant also kept going in and out of the house during the day and night,
closing the door loudly
and bringing mosquitoes into the rental unit. The
Tenant’s conduct woke the Landlord and tenants up during their sleep.
 
4.    
The first N5 notice
was served pursuant
to section 64 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006, which states:
 
(1)  
A
landlord may give a tenant
notice of termination of the tenancy
if the conduct of the tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a
person permitted in the residential complex by the tenant is such that it
substantially interferes with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential
complex for all usual purposes by the landlord or another tenant or
substantially interferes with another lawful right, privilege or interest of
the landlord or another tenant.
 
(2)  
A
notice of termination under subsection (1) shall,
 
(a)  
provide a termination date of not earlier than the 20th day after the notice
is given;
 
(b)  
set out the grounds
for termination; and
 
(c)  
require the tenant, within
seven days, to stop the conduct or activity or correct the omission set out in the
notice.
 
(3)  
The notice of termination under subsection (1) is void if the tenant, within
seven days after receiving the notice, stops the conduct or activity or
corrects the omission.
 
 
5.     In accordance section 64(3) of
the Act, the first
N5 notice is voided if the Tenant
does not engage in any
further conduct of the type described in the N5 notice during the 7 day period after the N5 notice was given to the Tenant.
In this case, that 7 day voiding period was August 24 to August 30, 2021.
 
6.     Section 43(2) of the Act
states in part that a notice of termination given by a Landlord
must “set out the reasons and details respecting the termination”.
 
7.     In this case, the landlord’s details respecting the allegations do not provide
specific dates but for one
allegation from an incident on August 22, 2021. With respect to the allegations during the months of July and
August, they are not specific and lacking in detail. I find that an open two
month period is not sufficient to satisfy the purposes of section 43(2) of the Act. The Tenant would not know when exactly she
was alleged to have engaged in the alleged conduct during the months of July
and August and this lack of detail would necessarily interfere with her ability
to know the case to be met.




 
8.    
The Landlord served a second
non-voidable N5 notice on the Tenant on August 31, 2021. The second N5 notice indicated a termination date of
September 30, 2021, the same date
as the first N5 notice.
 
9.     The
section N5 notice
was served pursuant
to section 68(1) of the Act
which states: A landlord
may give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy if,
(a)  
a
notice of termination was given under section 62, 64, or 67; and
 
(b)  
more than seven days but
less than six months after the notice mentioned in clause (a) was given to the tenant, an
activity takes place, conduct occurs or a situation arises that constitutes
grounds for a notice of termination under section
60, 61, 62, 64 or 67, other
than an activity, conduct or a situation that is described
in subsection 61(1)
and that involves
an illegal act, trade,
business or occupation described in clause 61(2)(a). [emphasis added]
 
 
10.  The second N5 notice indicated that additional
incidents occurred between August 22 and August 28, 2021, the Tenant smoked
inside the rental
unit, drank another
Tenant’s milk, took other Tenant’s food without permission and did her
laundry too many times which the Landlord found annoying.
 
11.  Again, the Landlord’s details respecting the
allegations do not provide specific dates but rather a range of dates from August 22, to August
28, 2021. By failing to include
specific dates, I find that this portion of the N5 Notice is invalid because it
does not comply with section 43 of the Act, which requires a notice of
termination to set out the reasons and details respecting the termination. This
claim also does not comply with the Divisional Court’s decision in Ball v. Metro Capital Property, [2002] O.J.
No. 5931, which stands for the principle
that a notice of termination must have particulars, including dates and times
for the alleged offensive conduct.
 
12.  The Tenant would not know when exactly she was alleged
to have engaged in the alleged conduct and this lack of detail
would necessarily interfere
with her ability
to know the case to be met.
 
13.  Further, while the second N5 contains some different
allegations as in the first N5
notice, the allegations are during the same period of time as set out in the
first N5 notice and during the voiding period.
Pursuant to section 68 of the Act, the second N5 notice can only
contain new incidents that occurred more than seven days but less than six
months after the first
N5 notice was served. Therefore, I cannot consider allegations contained in the
second N5 notice that are during the same period of time as the first N5 notice
and falls within the seven day remedy period the Tenant was given for the first
N5 notice.
