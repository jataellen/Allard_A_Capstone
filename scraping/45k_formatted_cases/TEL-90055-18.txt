Review Order
 
GS( the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict PG, Roya Golsorkhi and BG (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe and because they, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential
complex have substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord
also claimed NSF cheque charges and related administration charges.
 
This application was resolved by order TEL-90055-18
issued on June 7, 2018.
 
On June 18, 2018, the Tenants
requested a review of the order.
 
A preliminary review of the review
request was completed without a hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
On the basis of the
submissions made in the request and for the following reasons, I am not
satisfied that there is a serious error in the order or that a serious error
occurred in the proceedings.
2.     
The request for review says:
•       
The Board issued its order
on June 7, 2018, and erred by sending the order to the wrong address. The
Tenants did not receive the order until June 14, 2018 “thereby affecting any
relief that was granted as an extension for payment”;
•       
The period of the tenancy is
the 15th of the month to the 14th of the month by
agreement so the notice of termination is invalid as it shows the rental period
begins on the 1st of each month; and 
•       
The notice of termination
for non-payment of the rent is invalid as it does not accurately set out the
rent arrears owing due to the fact rent is due on the 15th and not
the 1st. 
3.     
Although it is not entirely
clear, it appears from the file that the Board did in fact send the Tenants the
wrong order. The problem was identified and the Tenants were sent the correct
order. According to the review request the Tenants received the order on June
14, 2018 by mail seven days after it was issued. 
4.     
It is not entirely clear
from the request why this administrative error could be the basis of a review.
The focus of the hearing was the Tenants’ request for relief in the form of a
repayment plan. The Board’s order denies the request for relief with respect to
the rent arrears but grants it with respect to the substantial interference
allegation. With respect to the rent arrears the Board’s order gives the Tenants
until June 18, 2018 to pay the rent arrears owing. 
5.     
Pursuant to s. 74(3)(b) of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’), on an application for
eviction due to non-payment of rent the Board is mandatorily required to insert
a clause in the order that informs the tenant and the landlord that the order
will become void if, before the order becomes enforceable, the tenant pays to
the landlord or to the Board the amount required to get to a zero balance
owing. Section 74 says nothing about the timing of the enforcement date.
Further, pursuant to s. 74(11) of the Act, a tenant has a one-time right to clear
the arrears and save the tenancy by paying after the enforcement date. 
6.     
If the Tenants received the
order on June 14, 2018 as the review states then they had an opportunity to pay
prior to the enforcement date of June 18, 2018, which is all the Act requires.
Further, there is no indication in the record before the Board that the Tenants
actually have the capacity or intention of clearing the rent arrears either
before or after the enforcement date and the review does not say otherwise. 
7.     
In other words, the
administrative error that arguably denied the Tenants a few days to get
together the money necessary to void is not a material error and cannot justify
review.  
8.     
The rest of the review
request is about the period of the tenancy.
9.     
I have listened to the entirety
of the audio recording before the Board. The review states:
A tenancy agreement was provided as evidence, and as
confirmed by the Landlord through direct and cross examination, wherein it
states “Tenant to provide 12 post dated cheques commencing October 15, 2017 to
September 15, 2018” (Article 5 of the Tenancy Agreement) 
10.  
No such tenancy agreement
was filed into evidence at the hearing before the Board. Rather the Landlord
testified that to assist the Tenants he agreed to accept the monthly rent on
the 15th day of each month instead of the 1st. The Tenants
then provided a series of post-dated cheques payable on the 15th of
the month.
11.  
It is not clear to me that
the Landlord’s evidence means that the parties agreed to change the period of
the tenancy. I would note that throughout the quite long and detailed portion
of the hearing where the Tenants presented their repayment plan, the Tenants’
representative repeatedly made reference to paying rent on the 1st
of the month when it was due. That appears to be an admission on the record
that although the Landlord was willing to accept payment on the 15th
the period of the tenancy did not change.
12.  
But assuming without finding
that the period of the tenancy did begin on the 15th that does not
invalidate the notice of termination and no such argument was actually made at
the hearing. 
13.  
There was no dispute between
the parties that the Tenants paid no rent for the months commencing January,
2018 up to the date of hearing of May 17, 2018. The notice of termination was
issued and served on March 16, 2018 so whether rent was due on the 1st
or the 15th the amount of rent arrears owing at the time the notice
was issued and served was the same – three months’ rent was then due and that
is the amount the notice claims. 
14.  
Section 59 of the Act says:
59 (1)  If a tenant fails to pay rent lawfully owing under
a tenancy agreement, the landlord may give the tenant notice of termination of
the tenancy effective not earlier than,
     (a)       the 7th day after the notice is given, in
the case of a daily or weekly tenancy; and
     (b)       the 14th day after the notice is given, in
all other cases. 
(2)  The notice of termination shall set out the amount
of rent due and shall specify that the tenant may avoid the termination of the
tenancy by paying, on or before the termination date specified in the notice,
the rent due as set out in the notice and any additional rent that has become
due under the tenancy agreement as at the date of payment by the tenant.  
(3)  The notice of termination is void if, before the day
the landlord applies to the Board for an order terminating the tenancy and
evicting the tenant based on the notice, the tenant pays,
     (a)       the rent that is in arrears under the
tenancy agreement; and
     (b)       the additional rent that would have been due
under the tenancy agreement as at the date of payment by the tenant had notice
of termination not been given.
[Emphasis added.]
15.  
As can be seen by this
provision, s. 59 says nothing about getting the period of the tenancy right on
a notice; rather the provision says a notice of termination must accurately set
out the rent due. The notice here did that regardless of whether or not the
period of the tenancy begins on the 15th or the 1st so
the mandatory requirements in the Act were met. The notice is not invalid. 
16.  
I would further note that s.
212 says substantial compliance with the Act respecting the contents of forms,
notices or documents is sufficient. Given that s. 59 is silent about a notice
for non-payment needing to accurately state the period of the tenancy, s. 212
indicates that if the Landlord did err by stating the period begins on the 1st
then such an error in these circumstances would not be sufficient to invalidate
the notice. 
17.  
Given all of the above, I am
not satisfied that there is a serious error in the order or that a serious
error occurred in the proceedings. The Tenants’ request for review must be
denied.
18.  
This order contains all of
the reasons for the decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The request to review order
TEL-90055-18 issued on June 7, 2018 is denied. The order is confirmed and
remains unchanged.
