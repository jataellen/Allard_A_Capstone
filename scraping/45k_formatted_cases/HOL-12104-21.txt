Tenant



 
 
 
Symone Bromfield (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Janet Llewellyn (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed NSF
cheque charges and related administration charges.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 13, 2022. The Landlord and the
Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period
from July 16, 2020 to
October 15, 2021. Because of the
arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 16,
2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on October
27, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,700.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
 
6.    
The Landlord incurred charges
of $21.00 for cheques tendered
by or on behalf of the
Tenant, which were returned NSF and $60.00 for related administration charges.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of October
27, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.




File Number: HOL-12104-21
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $18,348.17*, which
represents the amount
of rent owing and
compensation up to October 27, 2021 and the total charges related to NSF
cheques tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 1, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 2, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
