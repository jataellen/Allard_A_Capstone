Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-12694-20
 
 
In the matter of:      115 RIVER STREET
SEAGRAVE, ON L0C 1G0
 
 
 




Between:                  Bonnie Cohoon Aaron Cohoon


Landlords




 
and
 
 




George McDermott Dana McCullough


Tenants




 
 
 
Bonnie Cohoon and Aaron
Cohoon (the 'Landlords') made an L1 application for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict George McDermott and Dana McCullough (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
telephone/video-conference on December 2, 2021. The Landlord Bonnie Cohoon
attended the hearing
on behalf of both Landlords. As of 11:44am,
despite waiting over 2.5
hours since the start of the hearing block at 9am, the Tenants were not present
or represented at hearing although properly served with notice of the hearing
by the Board.
 
As per section 7 of the Statutory Powers Procedure Act the hearing continued in the Tenants’
absence.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Tenants failed to pay the
total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination with effective termination date September
23, 2020.
 
2.       
The Tenants were in possession of the rental
unit at the time the L1 application was filed.
Ms. Cohoon advised that the Tenants had vacated the rental unit on May 21,
2021. The application was amended to an L9 application for arrears only since
eviction was no longer necessary.
 
3.       
The monthly
rent was $1,038.00 for the duration
of arrears claimed.
Rent was due on the first (1st) day of each month.




File Number: TEL-12694-20
 
4.       
The Tenants paid $6,588.00 after the application was filed but before the hearing.
 
5.       
On January 1, 2014 the Landlords collected a last month’s
rent deposit of $1,000.00 from the Tenants. Interest is owed on the deposit from the date of collection,
January 1, 2014, up to the termination date in the N4 Notice of Termination,
September 23, 2020.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The tenancy is terminated as of May 21, 2021, the date the
Tenants gave vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlords.
 
2.       
If the Tenants made any payments
to the Landlords after the hearing but before the issuance date of this order, those amounts shall be deducted from the calculations below.
 
See attached
Schedule 1: Summary
of Calculations
 
3.       
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords
$2,301.06*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to the vacate date May 21, 2021.
 
4.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.       
If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlords the full amount
owing of $2,487.06** on or before January 23, 2022 (standard 11 days
from the issuance date of this order), the Tenants will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 24, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
