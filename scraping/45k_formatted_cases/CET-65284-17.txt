CT and RRobinson (the 'Tenants') applied
for an order determining that JW (the 'Landlord'): 
a)
harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered w ith them;
b)
entered the rental unit illegally;
c)
altered the locking system on a door giving entry to the rental unit or
residential complex without giving them replacement keys;
d)
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or
residential complex by the Tenants or by a member of their household and 
e)
withheld or deliberately interfered with the reasonable supply of a vital
service, care service, or food that the Landlord is obligated to supply under
the tenancy agreement (T2 Application).
 
The Tenants also applied for an order
determining that the Landlord failed to meet the Landlord's maintenance
obligations under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') or
failed to comply with health, safety, housing or maintenance standards (T6
Application).
 
The Landlord applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict CT and RR (the 'Tenants') because:
a)    they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted
in the residential complex have wilfully caused undue
damage to the premises; 
b)    they, another occupant of the rental unit or
someone they permitted in the residential complex have substantially interfered
with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlord in a residential complex that has three or fewer residential units;
and 
c)    they, another occupant of the rental unit or a
person the Tenants permitted in the residential complex have seriously impaired
the safety of any person (L2 Application-N7 Notice). 
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants because the Tenants entered into an
agreement to terminate the tenancy (L3 Application).  
 
The Landlord applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants because they, another occupant of
the rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have
wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises and because they,
another occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the
residential complex have substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The
Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenants to compensate the
Landlord for the damage (L2 Application-N5 Notice). 
 
The Landlord applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants because the Tenants did not pay the
rent that the Tenants owe (L1 Application).
 
The hearing was held in
Mississauga on May 11, 2017.
 
Only the Landlord's
Agent, HC attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Regarding Tenants T2
and T6 Applications
 
1.     
Since the Tenants did not
appear at the hearing to support their T2 and T6 applications, I find that
these applications have been abandoned.
2.     
The Landlord's Agent said
that the Tenants vacated the rental unit on April 11, 2017.
Regarding L2 Application – N7 Notice
3.     
The Tenants were given an N7
notice of termination on March 30, 2017.
4.     
It is not necessary to
proceed with this application because the Tenants have vacated the rental unit.
Therefore termination of the tenancy was accomplished as sought by the Landlord
in this application.
5.     
The Landlord's Agent did not
seek the damage claimed of $150.00 in the notice nor the cost of filing this
application.  The other claim for loss of income and food does not fall within
the ambit of section 89 of the Act and cannot be considered.  Damage in section
89 refers to wilful or negligent undue damage to the rental unit or the
residential complex. Loss of food and loss of income is not damage to the
rental unit or residential complex.
Regarding L3 Application – agreement to terminate
6.     
It is not necessary to
proceed with this application because the Tenants vacated the rental unit.
Termination of the tenancy was accomplished as sought by the Landlord in this
application.
Regarding L2 Application – N5 notice
7.     
The Tenants were given an N5
notice of termination on March 2, 2017.
8.     
This type of notice provides
the Tenants with an opportunity to void the notice depending on whether this is
a first or second notice.
9.     
The Landlord has not
specified whether the Tenants are able to void the notice.  She has indicated
that the notice can both be voided and that she can apply to the Board
immediately because this is a second notice.
10.   Even if I were to consider this a first N5
notice, the notice fails to provide the required 20 days’ notice after the
landlord served the notice to the Tenants.  The notice was served to the
Tenants on March 2, 2017 and the termination date is March 16, 2017 which is
less than 20 days.
11.   As the N5 notice is defective, there is no
jurisdiction to terminate the tenancy on the basis of this notice.
12.   In any event, the Tenants vacated the rental
unit as of April 11, 2017.
Regarding L1 rent arrears application
13.   The Tenants have not paid the total rent they
were required to pay for the period from February 1, 2017 to May 31, 2017. 
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
March 16, 2017.
14.   The Landlord collected a rent deposit of
$1,400.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlord.
15.   Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenants for the period from October 14, 2016 to March 16, 2017.
16.   I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act and find that it
would not be necessary to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act because the Tenant vacated the rental unit.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Tenants' T2 and T6
applications are dismissed.
2.     
The Landlord’s L2
application (N7 notice) is dismissed.
3.     
The Landlord’s L3
application is dismissed.
4.     
The Landlord’s L2
application (N5 notice) is dismissed.
L1 rent arrears
application:
5.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenants is terminated as of April 11, 2017.
6.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $1,897.47*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to April 11, 2017, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
7.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
8.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May 23, 2017, the Tenants will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from May 24,
2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
