Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-04404-22

  matter of:


392896 SIDE ROAD
39 RR4 DURHAM ON N0G1R0


 




Between:


Watra Property Management


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Jennifer Mcnutt


Tenant



 
On December 30, 2021, Watra
Property Management (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jennifer
Mcnutt (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant
pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a
condition specified in the order issued by the Board on July 26, 2021 with
respect to application CEL-91749-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant
has not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed
to pay to the Landlord
$1,414.58 on or before December
20, 2021 towards arrears of
rent.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order
required the Tenant
to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$19,975.00 for rent arrears in Order CEL-91749-20. The amount that is still owing from that order is $11,316.68 and that amount is included
in this order. As a result,
the previous order CEL-91749-20 is cancelled.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Order CEL-91749-20 is cancelled.
 
2.     
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 30, 2022.

3.     
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $11,316.68*. This amount represents the rent owing up to December 31, 2021.
 
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$25.97 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
January 30, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
January 31, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 30, 2022, then starting January
31, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 31, 2022.

The tenant has until January 29, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 29, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on July 31, 2022 if
the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
