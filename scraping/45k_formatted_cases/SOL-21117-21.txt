Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006


 




 


File Number: SOL-21117-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
LEFT UNIT, 6179
VILLAGE CR CRESCENT NIAGARA FALLS ON L2G7M3


 




Between:


Maria Irwin


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Roniie
Desson


Tenant



 
 
 
Maria Irwin
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Roniie
Desson (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on January 11, 2022.
 
Only the
Landlord attended the hearing. As of 11:45 a.m., the Tenant was not present or
represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from April 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the
arrears, the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination effective April 2, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $850.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $850.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from March 31, 2021 to April 2, 2021.
 
6.    
The Tenant
paid $5,521.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the




 
Tenant, and find that it would be
unfair to grant
relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 29, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $1,818.33*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
18, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $27.95
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 19, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
29, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 30, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 29, 2022, then starting January
30, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 30, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 29, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $3,165.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
30, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
