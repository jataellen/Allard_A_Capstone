Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number: TEL-20404-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
102, 2550 KINGSTON ROAD TORONTO ON M1M1L7


 




Between:


WJ Properties


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Aubrey Glasgow


Tenant



 
 
 
WJ Properties (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Aubrey Glasgow (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February
15, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, David Ciobotaru,
attended the hearing. As of 12:52 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
November 1, 2016 to February 28,
2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October 21, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,117.55
as of February 1, 2022.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,104.30 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021 to October 21, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $6,800.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.     The amount outstanding to February 28, 2022,
inclusive of rent arrears ($11,553.58), and costs ($186.00), is $11,739.58.




 
8.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
9.    
The parties have reached
a repayment agreement. Although the Tenant
was not present at the hearing, the Landlord
requested a conditional order with the terms of the repayment agreement between
the parties.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$11,739.58, which represents the arrears of rent
($11,553.58), and costs ($186.00) outstanding for the period ending February
28, 2022.
 
2.     The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant is denied
on the condition that:
 
(a)

monies owing under paragraph 1 of this order:

breach of a condition set out in paragraph 2 of this order.
