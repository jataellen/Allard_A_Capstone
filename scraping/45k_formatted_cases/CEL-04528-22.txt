Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Amina Javaid


Tenant



 
 
 
Two Silver Maple Holdings
Inc. C/o Gwl Realty Advisors
Residential Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Amina Javaid (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the
Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a
condition specified in the order issued by the Board on June 21, 2021 with
respect to application CEL- 96932-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $568.39 arrears
on or before January 20, 2022. The Tenant did not pay $1529.55 rent on or before
January 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $6,820.73 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order CEL-96932-20. The amount that is still owing from that
order is $3,970.73 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order CEL-96932-20 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from January 1, 2022 to February 28, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,529.55 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2022 to February 9, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order CEL-96932-20 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 20, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$2,989.28*. This amount represents the rent owing up to February 9, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$50.29 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 10, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
20, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 21, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 20, 2022, then starting February
21, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 21, 2022.

The tenant has until February 19, 2022
to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by February 19, 2022 the order will be stayed and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on August 21, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
