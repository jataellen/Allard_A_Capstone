Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-04575-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


G2, 2339
PARK TOWERS AVENUE MISSISSAUGA ON L5A1P8


 




Between:


667259 Ontario Limited


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jayne Claire Stubley Ronald Fabcic


Tenants



 
 
 
667259 Ontario Limited (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ronald Fabcic
and Jayne Claire
Stubley (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the
rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on November 15, 2021 with
respect to application CEL-96857-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants have not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $500 arrears
on or before January 20, 2022. The Tenant did not
pay $1307.79 rent in full, on or before February 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an order
for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $2,312.16 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order CEL-96857-20. The amount that is still owing from that
order is $508.90 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order CEL-96857-20 is cancelled.

5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenants
have failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from December 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order CEL-96857-20 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants
must move out of the rental unit on or before March 8, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$2,380.54*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to February 25, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $43.00 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 26, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before March 8, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 9, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 8, 2022, then starting
March 9, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 9, 2022.
