File Number: SWL-51332-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
2B, 1091 WYANDOTTE STREET W WINDSOR ON
  N9A5Y6


 




Between:


2692140 Ont. Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Robert Justin Zantutto


Tenant



 
 
 
2692140 Ont. Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Robert
Justin Zantutto (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the
residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the
premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to
compensate the Landlord for the damage. The Landlord also claimed compensation
for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 29, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Melissa Bradley, and the Landlord’s
Agents, Punjitha Pripuramei (‘PP’) and Paul Klinic (‘PK’), attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     This application is about the Tenant playing loud
music, having loud guests, performing electrical work causing damage, removing
smoke detectors, working on stolen E-bikes in the common arears, and blocking
the fire exits with various items.
 
2.     The Landlord states they have received multiple
complaints from other tenants about the Tenant’s behaviour. The Landlord
submits a declaration from another tenant of the residential complex declares
that the Tenant:
 
always plays loud music in midnight. He let homeless
people into building, which they partying all night. It takes place every other
night in the building. He does repair with E-bikes and due to his activity we
lost power 2 days in a row in Sep 2020. I reported to Landlord every week due
to his behaviour I am and other tenants end up sleepless nights and cause
anxiety.
 
3.     PP confirmed that Tenant caused a power outage at the residential complex, the constant loud music is a nuisance to other
tenant’s, and that the Tenant removed the smoke detectors and tampered with
electrical wiring at the residential complex.




 
4.    
Based on the uncontested evidence,
I find that the Tenant’s behaviour has substantially interfered with another
tenant’s or the Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex, and
lawful rights, privileges, or interests.
 
5.    
The Landlord seeks damages of $700
for the Certificate of Service to repair the damage caused by the Tenant in
performing the unauthorized electrical work and replacing the smoke detectors.
These costs are denied. The Landlord failed to adduce sufficient evidence to
prove these costs.
 
6.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenant did not attend the hearing to
request relief and the Landlord was not aware of any of the Tenant’s
circumstances to grant relief.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated, as of February 14, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before February 14, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $16.44 per day for
compensation for the use of the unit
from February 15, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing on or before February 14, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 15, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 14, 2022, then starting
February 15, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord on or after February 15, 2022.
