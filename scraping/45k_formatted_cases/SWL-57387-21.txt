Michelle

Tenant



 
 
 
CLV Group (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Michelle
Hill (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the
Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet
a condition specified in the order issued by the Board
on August 4, 2021 with respect to application
SWL-52160-21.
 
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.    
The Board issued an
order pertaining to file number SWL-52160-21 on August 4, 2021 which required
the Tenant to make regularly scheduled payments to the Landlord that were to be applied
against outstanding rental
arrears. The order also required
the Tenant to continue making
payments of lawful rent for each month that becomes due during the period in
which the arrears were to be paid, which was agreed to be from July 1, 2021
through to February 1, 2023.
 
 
2.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain conditions specified in the order.
 
 
3.    
Pursuant to subsection 78(5)
of the Act, an application made under section
78 must be filed no later than 30 days after the
breach of the order.
 
 
4.    
Within the subject L4 application the Landlord claims
that the Tenant had made limited
payments (which are inconsistent with the conditions set out in the order),
since the August 4, 2021 order was issued, as follows:




File Number: SWL-57387-21
 
•        
Payment of $1, 596.00 made on August 1, 2021
 
•        
Payment of $1, 344.87
made on November
1, 2021
 
 
5.    
The L4 application also indicates that since the August 4, 2021 order,
unpaid rental payments of
$5600.13 had accumulated which, at the monthly rental rate of
$1,389.00/month, is equivalent to the three
months that followed
the order.
 
 
6.    
The Landlord’s
application to the Board dated December 6, 2021 was filed by email on December 10, 2021 which, pursuant to s. 78 (5) of the Act, is more than 30 days after the
Tenant failed to meet a condition set out in hearing order SWL-52160-21dated
August 4, 2021.
 
 
 
7.    
The Board
does not have jurisdiction to consider this application as it was filed beyond the statutory 30-day period after
the alleged breaches had taken place.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord's application under section
78 of the Act is dismissed.
