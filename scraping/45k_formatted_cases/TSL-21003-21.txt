Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number:
TSL-21003-21




 
In the matter
  of:


 
B4, 331 BARTLETT AVENUE TORONTO ON M6H3G8


 




Between:


Toronto Community Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Norma Dickinson


Tenant



 
 
 
Toronto Community Housing
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Norma Dickinson (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has committed an
illegal act and because the Tenant has seriously impaired the safety of another
person within the residential complex. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date.
This
application was heard by video conference on July 13, 2021, beginning at 9:00
a.m.. Only the Landlord’s Agent Kamram Baradar-Gohari attended the hearing. As of 11:30
a.m. the
Tenant was not present
or represented at this hearing
although properly served
with a notice of the
hearing by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Landlord commenced the application seeking
an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant N.D. because N.D.
committed an illegal act and seriously impaired the safety of another person
within the residential complex.
 
2.       
The application was unopposed.
 
3.       
On March 5, 2021 the Landlord
served N6 and N7 Notices
to End Your Tenancy with a
termination date of April 5, 2021.
 
4.       
On January 23, 2021,
the Landlord became
aware of a report to Special Constable
Partat Sandhu with the Toronto Police Service of illegal activity
occurring within the residential complex.
 
5.       
The complainant, who is another
resident of the building, reported to S.C. Sandhu that when he entered the building by the main door around
1:00 a.m., N.D. was present
and




 
purportedly yelled at him. N.D.
then picked up a nearby cinderblock from the floor and threw it at him. The complainant successfully dodged the missile. The cinderblock missed striking him merely by a few
inches before it hit the ground, breaking into pieces.
 
6.       
The Landlord provided the January 23, 2021 video surveillance camera
footage to the police for review. The video tape
confirmed the contents of the police report. This evidence was presented
through the Landlord’s witness S.C. Sandhu.
 
7.       
The Landlord proceeded to serve the Notices to terminate the tenancy on N.D..
 
8.       
I
find that the Landlord has established that the Tenant
committed an illegal
act within the residential complex, and that the
Tenant’s actions on that date placed the other resident at risk of serious
physical harm.
 
9.       
At the hearing, the Landlord submitted
that the incident
was singular in nature and, with
an intent to preserve the tenancy if possible, requested a conditional order.
 
10.    I am satisfied
that a conditional order is reasonable in the circumstances.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The Landlord’s application to evict the Tenant is denied on the condition
that:
 
(1) For the duration
of the tenancy,
 
(a)    
The Tenant shall not commit an illegal act by assaulting, or attempting to assault,
another person within the residential complex; and
 
(b)     The Tenant shall not impair
the safety of any person,
or place any person at risk
of serious impairment, within the residential complex.
 
2.       
On or by February
28, 2022, the Tenant shall
pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of
filing the application.
 
3.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before February
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.       
If the Tenant fails to comply
with paragraph 1 of this order, the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Act, without
notice to the Tenant, for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenant. The Landlord must make this application no later than 30 days after any
breach of this order by the Tenant.
