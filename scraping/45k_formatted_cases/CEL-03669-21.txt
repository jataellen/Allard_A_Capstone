Cassie Hergert                                                                                                                 Tenant
 
 
 
Natalie Mina and Paul Mina (the
'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Cassie Hergert (the 'Tenant') because
the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for
the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard
via videoconference on January 6, 2022.
 
The Landlords, the Landlord’s witness, Michaeil Lingham,
the Tenant, and the Tenant’s
legal representative, Christina DePalma, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Preliminary Issues
 
1.       
At the outset of the hearing, the
Tenants’ legal representative asked that the second- named Tenant, ‘KB’, be
removed as a named Tenant in the application. KB has never lived in the
rental unit and is only a guarantor. As the Landlord
did not raise an objection, we find no reason to deny the
Tenant’s request to amend the application accordingly.
 
2.       
On September 15, 2021, the Landlords served the Tenants
with an N12 notice of termination.
 
3.       
The date of termination stated on
the notice is February 28, 2022. There is currently a lease in place between
the parties and the term of
the lease ends on February 24, 2022.
 
4.       
Subsection 48(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') says,
“the date for termination specified in the notice
shall be at least 60 days after the notice is
given and shall be the day a
period of the tenancy ends or, where the tenancy is for a fixed term, the end of the term.”




File Number: CEL-03669-21
 
5.       
As the date of termination on the notice
is not the end of the lease term, the notice fails to
comply with the mandatory requirements of the Act and is invalid. As the notice
is invalid, the Landlord’s
application must be dismissed.
 
6.       
This order contains all the reasons
for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The
Landlords' application is dismissed.
 
 
January 17, 2022
