Riordan Michelle Sciuk


Tenants



 
 
 
736963 Ontario
Limited (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Michelle Sciuk and Derek Riordan
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on March 31, 2021 at 9:00 a.m.
 
The Landlord, represented by Nathan
Lean, a Lawyer, and the Tenants, represented by Shabbir Shaike, a
licensed Paralegal, attended the hearing.
 
 
Preliminary Issue:
 
 
1.    The Tenant’s representative submitted that the N4 – “Notice
to End your Tenancy For Non-payment of Rent”; specifically
the notice fails to comply with
section 59 (2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act 2006 (the “Act”)
59 (1) If a tenant fails to pay rent lawfully owing under a tenancy agreement, the landlord may give
the tenant notice of termination of the tenancy effective not earlier than,
 
(a)              
the 7th day after the
notice is given, in the case of a daily or weekly
tenancy;
 
and
 
(b)              
the 14th day
after the notice is given, in all other cases.
2006, c. 17, s. 59 (1).




 
 
 
Contents of notice
 
(2) The
notice of termination shall set out the amount of rent due and shall specify
that the tenant may avoid the termination of the tenancy by paying, on or
before the termination date
specified in the notice,
the rent due as set out in the notice
and any additional rent that has
become due under the tenancy agreement as at the date of payment by the tenant. 2006, c. 17, s. 59 (2).
 
In this case
the N4 “Notice to End your Tenancy For Non-payment of Rent” the rent calculation does not properly reflect the
outstanding rent claimed by the Landlord.
 
 
2.   
My ruling
at the hearing was that the N4 Notice was
defective.
 
3.   
As a result of the defect with the N4 Notice the Landlord
requested to convert
the application to an L9 application for arrears only. I consented to this request.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from April 1, 2020 to March 31,
2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective November 1, 2020.
 
2.    
The Tenants
were in possession of the rental
unit when the application
was filed.
 
3.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $2,000.00
from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
4.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from July 16, 2019 to
November 1, 2020.
 
5.    
The Tenants
paid $10,000.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.    
As of the hearing
date, the parties
agreed that the Tenant owes the Landlord
$14,450.00 including arrears of rent of $14,264.00 to March 31, 2021 and
the application fee of
$186.00.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$14,264.00, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to March 31, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.




 
3.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
23, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from January 24,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
