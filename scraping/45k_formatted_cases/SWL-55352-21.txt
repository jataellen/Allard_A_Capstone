In the matter
of:


308, 130 CHRISTOPHER DRIVE CAMBRIDGE ON N1R4S4


 




Between:


Kastda Apartments Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Stephanie Kendall


Tenant



 
 
 
Kastda
Apartments Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Stephanie Kendall (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has been
persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent.
 
This
application was heard via videoconference on January 24, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s legal representative, E. Schroeder, attended the hearing. As of 10:34 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented although properly served with notice of this hearing by the
Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants because the Tenant persistently failed to
pay rent when it was due. The Landlord served on the Tenant an N8 notice to
terminate on September 28, 2021.
 
2.    
Rent is due on the first of each month.
 
3.     As per the N8 Notice, the Tenant had not paid rent in
full by the first of the month twelve times in twelve months.
 
4.    
The Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
5.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction
subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection
83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
6.     The Landlord disclosed
that the Tenant
paid the rent in full and on time from October 2021 to
December 2021. However,
the Tenant’s rent for January
2022 was outstanding as of the date of the hearing.

7.    
While the Tenant did not attend
the hearing to testify to her circumstances, I am required to consider all of
the circumstances. The Tenant paid the rent in full and on time every month
after the notice was served, with the exception of January 2022 rent. As
eviction is the remedy of last resort, the Tenant should be afforded another
opportunity to continue the tenancy, provided the Tenant meet the conditions
set out in this order.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
 
1.   
The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant
is denied on the condition
that:
 
a)    
The Tenant shall pay the full
monthly rent on or before the first day of each month, commencing March 1, 2022
and for 12 months thereafter up to and including February 1, 2023.
 
2.   
If the Tenant fails to comply with
the conditions set out in paragraph 1 above, then, within 30 days of the breach, the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for
an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord must
make the application within 30 days of a breach of a condition set out in
paragraph 1 of this order.
 
3.   
The Tenant shall also pay to the
Landlord $186 for the cost of filing the application on or before February 21,
2022.
 
4.   
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing on or before February 21, 2022, the Tenant will
start to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from February 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
