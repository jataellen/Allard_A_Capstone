Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-23447-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


337 MAIN STREET
PORT DOVER ON N0A1N0


 




Between:


Maria Piperni


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Will Austin


Tenant



 
 
 
Maria Piperni (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Will Austin (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes
(‘L1 Application’) and because the Tenant persistently failed
to pay rent on the date it was due (‘L2 Application’).
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on October 20, 2021.
Only the Landlord attended the
hearing. As of 10:43 a.m. the Tenant was not present or represented although
properly served with the notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
L2 Application
 
1.    
The Tenant has been persistently
late in paying rent. He was late every month between February 2018 and May
2021. The Landlord subsequently served the Tenant with a notice of termination because he persistently paid rent late
in May 2021. The Tenant has
not paid rent since receiving this notice and has therefore been late his their
rent payments every month since May 2021.
 
2.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction in the L2 Application subject to
the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a)
and 204(1) of the Act. At the hearing the Landlord did not request that this tenancy
be terminated if and did not object
to the Board ordering that the Tenant pays rent on
time for 12 months if he voids the L1 component of the Order.
 
L1 Application




 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
January 20, 2021 to November 19, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective May 10, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,020.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant made no payments after this application was filed but before the date of this
hearing.
 
5.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including the impact of Covid-19 on the
parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a payment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
L1 Application
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 29, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $11,562.47*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 18, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$33.53 per day for
compensation for the use of the unit starting January 19, 2022 to
the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
29, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 30, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 29, 2022, then starting January 30, 2022, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 30, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$11,797.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 19, 2022, or
ii)             
$12,817.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 29, 2022**.




 
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
30, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
L2 Application
 
10. 
If the Tenant voids
the L1 component of this order in accordance with paragraph 8 above,
then for 12-month period beginning in February 2022 and continuing for each
month until January 2023 inclusive, the Tenant shall pay the monthly rent to
the Landlord on or before the 20th day of each month.
 
11.  If the Tenant fails to make any of the payments
required under paragraphs 10 of this order in full and on time, the Landlord may apply under s. 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 within 30 days of the
breach without notice to the Tenant for an order terminating the tenancy and
evicting the Tenant
