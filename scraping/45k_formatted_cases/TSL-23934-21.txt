In the
  matter of:


2459 GERRARD ST E TORONTO ON M4E2G3


 




Between:


Jeffrey M Carey


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Cassio Peia Providence Chance Mylo Twardowski Chloe Isabella Twardowski


Tenants



 
 
 
Jeffrey M Carey (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Cassio Peia Providence,
Chance Mylo Twardowski and Chloe Isabella Twardowski (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe (L1);
and because they,
another occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the
residential complex have substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant (L2).
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on February
15, 2022. The Landlord’s
representative Bryan Rubin, and the Tenant Cassio Peia Providence, attended the
hearing.
 
The Tenant ranted for approximately ten minutes about
a letter they received in
April 2021 and various other issues. It appears the subject of the letter was
about the Landlord’s intent to sell the property. The Tenant would not stop talking covering
subjects unrelated to this application, and made no submissions
about the arrears or unpaid utility bills. The
Tenant mentioned on numerous occasions she would be taking this to the Supreme
Court.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from January 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective June 30, 2021.
 
2.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $3,000.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
3.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from December 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021.




 
4.    
By the time this application was filed in June 2021 the Tenant owed to $1,681.25 in unpaid gas, hydro and water bills.
 
5.     The total amount
the Tenants owe the Landlord
exceeds the Board’s
monetary jurisdiction of $35,000.00. This
order reflects the Board’s jurisdiction.
 
6.     The Tenants have substantially interfered with the Landlord’s lawful right and privilege by not paying the utility costs as
required in the tenancy agreement. As
such, this order cannot be voided by the Tenants.
 
7.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 6, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $35,000.00, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
23, 2022, the cost the Landlord has incurred to pay
the utility charges,
plus the cost of the application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
3.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before March 6, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from March 7,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 6, 2022, then starting
March 7, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
5.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 7, 2022.
