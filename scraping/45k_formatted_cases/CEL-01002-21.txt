Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-01002-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


407, 25 GLENN
HAWTHORNE BOULEVARD
  MISSISSAUGA ON L5R3E6


 




Between:


Peel Housing Corp Op As Peel Living


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Keeria Monteith


Tenant



 
 
Peel Housing Corp Op As Peel
Living (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Keeria
Monteith (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 10, 2022. Only
the Landlord's Legal Representative, Cyrina Aska attended the hearing. As of 10:16 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the total
rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from April 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective May 30, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant is in possession
of the rental unit.
 
3.     
The lawful monthly rent is $234.00.
 
4.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $234.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021
to May 30, 2021.
 
6.      The Tenant paid $2,026.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.      I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19
on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenant and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until February 28, 2022 pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.

It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.
 
2.    
As of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears
of rent and compensation the
Landlord is entitled to by $35.53*.
 
3.     However, the Landlord
is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenant:
$7.69 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
January 19, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit,
and
$186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.     The Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 28, 2022, then starting
March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
7.     If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$468.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022,
or
ii)             
$702.00 if the payment
is made on or before February 28, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after March
1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
