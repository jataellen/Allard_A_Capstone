CEL-74078-18-RV
Order under Section 21.2
of the 
Statutory Powers
Procedure Act 
and the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 










 

Review Order
 
SA and OI (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict RR (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes (L1 application).
 
The Landlord’s L1 application was resolved by order
CEL-74078-18, issued on April 23, 2018.
 
On June 8, 2018, the Tenant requested a review of that
order.
 
The Tenant’s review request was heard in Mississauga
on June 26, 2018.
 
The Landlords’ agent/son, PAl, the
Landlord's Legal Representative. SS, and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Preliminary Matters:
 
1.     
The Tenants name is not
spelled correctly on the application or in the order issued on April 23, 2018.
It has been corrected in this order. The Tenant submitted his passport to show
the correct spelling of his name. The Landlord did not dispute the correction
of the Tenant’s name
 
2.     
The Tenant stated that the
named Landlord is not his Landlord. He believes his landlord is the owner of
the restaurant that is located below his apartment. He said he paid his rent to
the man who runs the restaurant or his wife.
 
3.     
The Tenant rents an
apartment above a restaurant. The Landlord owns the commercial unit downstairs
and the residential unit upstairs.
4.     
The Landlord stated that the
person who operates the restaurant downstairs is their commercial tenant. The
Tenant often left his rent payments at the restaurant downstairs for the
Landlord to collect.
5.     
The Landlord presented tax
bills for the property which show the numbered company as the owner of the
property. 
 
6.     
SA is the president of the
numbered company as is reflected in the rent receipts for 2014 and 2015 that
the Tenant submitted with his review request.
 
7.     
Based on the tax bills, I am
satisfied that the numbered company is the owner of the property and therefore
meets the definition of a landlord as set out in section 2 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006, (the ‘Act’).
 
Determinations and Reasons:
 
The Tenant’s Review Request
 
1.     
The Tenant alleges that he
was not reasonably able to participate in the hearing that took place on April
18, 2018 because he was out of the country at that time. 
2.     
The Tenant presented his passport
to establish that he was out of the country from February 1, 2018 to May 29,
2018. 
3.     
The Tenant stated that he did
not inform the Landlord that he was leaving the country and he made no arrangements
for anyone to look after his apartment or collect his mail in his absence.
4.     
The Notice of Hearing was
mailed to the Tenant. The Tenant found it when he returned home after a four
month absence. 
5.     
It is not reasonable to
leave the country for four months without making arrangements to attend to
important matters that will arise during a lengthy absence. During such a
lengthy absence the Tenant exposed himself to the risk of important matters
proceeding in his absence as was the case with the initial hearing of the
Landlord’s rent arrears application.
6.     
However, the Landlord was
not opposed to granting the Tenant’s review request and re-hearing the L1 rent
arrears application so the review request was granted.
The Lawful Rent Amount
7.     
The lawful monthly rent is
$800.00.
8.     
The Tenant disputed the rent
amount. He stated that his rent is only $400.00 per month. The Tenant had a
roommate when the tenancy began about nine years ago. He said the rent was
$800.00 per month but he and his roommate split the rent equally at $400.00
each. His roommate moved out a number of years ago. The Tenant believes his
rent should have been reduced to $400.00 per month when his roommate moved out.
9.     
There was no evidence presented
to suggest that there were two separate tenancies. Rent receipts that the
Tenant presented from as far back as 2009 establish that the rent was $800.00
per month for the rental unit. The Tenant and his roommate were free to split
the rent in any way they decided was fair. However, that does not create two
separate tenancies or change that there is one joint tenancy for the rental
unit at $800.00 per month. When the roommate moved out, the Tenant was
obligated to continue paying $800.00 per month for the rental unit and his own
evidence (rent receipts) show that he did pay $800.00 per month for multiple years
after his roommate moved out.
10.  
Furthermore, section 136 of
the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006, (the ‘Act’) states
that rent charged for one or more years is deemed lawful. Therefore, the $800.00
that was charged and paid for multiple years is deemed to be the lawful monthly
rent.
The Rent Arrears Owing
11.  
The Tenant has not paid $20,800.00
of the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from May 1,
2016 to June 30, 2018. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a N4 Notice
of Termination.
12.  
The Landlord submitted a
very detailed rent ledger with the amount and dates of payments the Tenant made
from 2014 to 2018. The rent ledger reflects the same amount set out in the N4 Notice
of Termination and in the L1 application.
13.  
I am satisfied that the rent
ledger and the N4 notice of termination accurately reflect the correct amount
of rent due.
14.  
However, since the Landlord
gave the Tenant two rent receipts on June 28, 2017 which the Tenant submitted
at the review hearing that state that all rent owing for 2014 and 2015 was paid
in full, I find that the Landlord has waived the $500.00 balance that was
claimed in the L1 application for 2015. Therefore, $500.00 has been deducted
from the amount the Landlord claimed.
15.  
The Landlord’s L1
application reflects that the Tenant paid rent of $800.00 per month for the
period January to April 2016.
16.  
Therefore, the first rent
owing by the Tenant is as of May 1, 2016.
17.  
The Tenant owes the
following amounts to the Landlord:
•       
For the eight month period
from May to December 2016 $800.00 x 8 months=$6,400.00
•       
For the twelve month period
from January to December 2017 $800.00 x 12 months=$9,600.00
•       
For the six month period
from January to June 2016 $800.00 x 6 months=$4,800.00
•       
The above three amounts
total $20,800.00 for the period May 1, 2016 to June 30, 2018. 
18.  
The Tenant believes he
owes no rent to the Landlord up to May 31, 2018. 
19.  
The Tenant agrees he
owes the June 2018 rent to the Landlord. However, that is the only amount he
believes he owes.
20.  
During the hearing it
was apparent that the Tenant’s belief that he owes no rent is based on his
misunderstanding of the law. For example, he believes his rent should be reduced
to $400.00 as of when his roommate moved out. He stated that he has an
overpayment or credit for each month that he paid $800.00 instead of $400.00. As
already explained above, the monthly rent is not $400.00.
21.  
The Tenant also
mistakenly believes that he does not have to pay rent for the months he was out
of the country. He said his tenancy is a month-to-month tenancy so he owes no
rent for the months he was out of the country. He believes he only has to pay
rent if he is physically in the unit. 
22.  
The Tenant is mistaken
in that belief. He was still in possession of the rental unit while he was out of
the country. Simply leaving the unit for an extended trip does not end the
tenancy. The Tenant’s belongings were still in the unit. He still had the key
to the unit while he was away. If the Tenant’s belief was correct, that would
mean he would have no right to return to the unit when he was back in the
country because his tenancy would have ended when he left. His tenancy did not
end.
23.  
The Tenant also alleges
he paid $8,000.00 rent in advance in September 2015 which covers the rent owing
for 2016. 
24.  
The Tenant presented a
receipt from September 2015 which states the payment is for September 2015 rent
and the amount of $8,000.00 was paid. It is identical in form to the two
receipts provided for the two months prior in August 2015 and July 2015. Those
two prior receipts are for $800.00 each.
25.  
It was clear from the September
2015 receipt that it has been altered. The receipt was originally written out
for the amount of $800.00 in both numerical and written form. Someone has
clearly written eight thousand over the original eight hundred
and also added an additional zero to the numeric portion of the $800.00 receipt.
26.  
The Tenant has submitted
false and misleading evidence which is an offence under the Act. Offences under
the Act are investigated and prosecuted by the Rental Housing Enforcement Unit.
27.  
I do not accept this
altered receipt as evidence of an $8,000.00 payment. The receipt is for an
$800.00 payment for the September 2015 rent.
28.  
The Tenant stated that
he has not made any rent payments to the Landlord since August 2016. However, he
believes his alleged “overpayment” of $400.00 per month for years and the
alleged $8,000.00 payment in 2015 covers his rent in 2016 and 2017. He also does
not think he owes any rent for 2018 because he was out of the country.
29.  
The Landlord has already
credited the Tenant with rent payments of $800.00 per month for the period
January to April 2016. The Tenant alleges he paid the rent for an additional
four months in 2016 for the period May to August 2016. Although he was out of
the country for some time in 2016, he claims a friend of his paid cash to the
person who runs the restaurant downstairs. There is no receipt for the alleged
cash payments even though the Tenant has a receipt for every other payment he
has made during the tenancy.
30.  
I am not satisfied that
the Tenant paid the rent for the period May to August 2016. There was
insufficient evidence presented to support the alleged cash payment. Without
receipts, cash payments are very difficult to establish.
31.  
Also, the credibility of
the Tenant has been negatively impacted by the altered receipt for the alleged
$8,000.00 payment.
The Last Month's Rent Deposit 
32.  
There is no last month's
rent deposit.
33.  
The Tenant stated that there
is a last month's rent deposit of $800.00. He relied on a receipt dated May 26,
2009 which shows that another tenant who lived the rental unit prior to the
Tenant paid a person who is not the Landlord named in this application a last
month's rent deposit of $800.00. Attached to this receipt is a handwritten note
which states that this deposit should be transferred and credited to the
Tenant.
34.  
The Landlord’s son said
there is no record of a last month's rent deposit paid to the Landlord by the
Tenant or transferred to him from anyone else.
35.  
The receipt does establish
that a last month's rent deposit was paid to the Landlord. It identifies
another person who is not the Landlord as receiving the deposit. The Tenant
stated this must have been the person who owned the building in 2009 before the
current Landlord owned it but he had no evidence to support this statement.
36.  
The Landlord stated they
have owned the property for the past 15 years.
37.  
Also, given the altered
receipt for the alleged $8,000.00 payment discussed above, I am not satisfied
of the authenticity of the self-serving, handwritten note stating the deposit
is transferred to the Tenant.
Eviction Date
38.  
The Tenant initially stated
he can move out of the rental unit if the Landlord wants him to. He then said
he does not want to move.
39.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. 
40.  
Although I acknowledge that
this is a long term tenancy, the rent arrears owing are substantial and by the
Tenant’s own admission no rent payments have been made since 2016. It would be
unfair to delay or deny the eviction. The Tenant has already received the
benefit of as delay as a result of his review request and no rent has been paid
to the Landlord for that period or the current month.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Order CEL-74078-18, issued
on April 23, 2018, is cancelled and replaced by the following: 
2.

$20,800.00*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to
June 30, 2018.
4.

the Landlords $26.30 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
July 1, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before July 9, 2018, then starting July 10, 2018, the Landlords may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.

the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlords, on or after July 10, 2018.
8.

9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after July 10, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlords.
