In the
  matter of:


23 RED ROSE LANE
EAST GWILLIMBURY ON
  L9N1K3


 




Between:


Oleg Zeleni


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Hashim Balasene
  Qaedi Lamyaa


Tenants



 
 
On December 20, 2021, Oleg Zeleni
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Qaedi
Lamyaa and Hashim Balasene (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants
pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the Board on December 7, 2020 with respect to
application TNL-25631-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I
find that the Tenants have not met the following
condition(s) specified in the order:
 
The Tenants failed
to pay to the Landlord
$750.00 on or before December
15, 2021 towards arrears of
rent.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $14,189.55 for rent
arrears in Order TNL-25631-20. The amount that is still owing from that order
is $5,369.55 and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous order TNL-25631-20 is
cancelled.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TNL-25631-20 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 28, 2022.




3.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $5,369.55*. This amount represents the rent owing up to December 31, 2021.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $124.93
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 1, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
28, 2022, the Tenants will start
to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from
January 29, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 29, 2022.

The tenant has until January 27, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 27, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on July 29, 2022 if
the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
