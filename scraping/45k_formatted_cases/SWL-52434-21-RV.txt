Review Order
 
Tyler Murphy (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Natasha Close and Cory
Bacon (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord has entered into an agreement of
purchase and sale of the rental unit and the purchaser requires possession of
the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was resolved by order SWL-52434-21 issued on July 29, 2021. On August 8, 2021, the Tenants
requested a review of the order.
The request was heard via video conference on November 5, 2021.
 
The Landlord and the Landlord’s legal representative, Loryn
Lux attended the hearing. The Tenants attended the hearing and were
self-represented.
 
The Tenants consulted with Tenant Duty Counsel, prior to the hearing.
 
The Landlord called as a witness,
the spouse of the purchaser, Karol Wojciechowski (KW).
 
Determinations:
 
Review:
 
1.    
The Landlord consented to the Tenants’
request to review.
 
2.    
I
proceeded to hold a de novo (anew) hearing on the Landlord’s L2 application.
 
L2 application:
 
1.   
This is a month to
month tenancy and the rent is due on the 1st day of each month.




 
2.   
The rental unit is a semi-detached house and the Tenants rent the entire house. The Tenants live in the unit with their three children, ages,
11, 7 and 5.
 
3.   
On or about August
13, 2020, the Landlord entered
into an agreement of purchase
and sale of the residential property and the closing date was November
2, 2020.
 
4.    The Landlord filed
with the Board, a
declaration by the purchaser. The purchaser declared that she intends to live and
occupy the residential unit for a period of at least 12 months.
 
5.    The Landlord served the Tenants with a Notice to End
your Tenancy Because the Landlord, a Purchaser or a Family
Member Requires the Rental Unit (the
‘N12 notice’), on June 23, 2021. The N12 has a
termination date of August 31, 2021; and indicates the Landlord has signed an
Agreement of Purchase and Sale of the rental unit and the purchaser intends to
move into the rental unit.
 
6.   
The Landlord provided the Tenants with a cheque dated July 1, 2021 in the amount of
$1,272.50, which represents
compensation of one month’s rent.
 
7.   
The Landlord testified that the purchaser requires vacant possession of the unit and the closing will be extended for vacant
possession. They plan to complete the real estate transaction.
 
8.   
During cross examination, the Landlord testified
that he purchased the property
in July 19, 2020 as an investment property.
 
9.    Subsection 49(1) of Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act') requires the Landlord to establish two points to support this
application for termination of the tenancy. First, the Landlord must establish that they
entered into an agreement of purchase and sale for the
property; second, the Landlord must establish that the purchaser in good faith
requires possession of the property for residential occupation by the
purchaser.
 
10. At the hearing, the Tenants questioned the validity of
the agreement of purchase and sale as the agreement was not initialed by both
parties, in certain places. As well, the agreement did not disclose conditions
in the home that was brought to the original Landlord’s attention (mould,
leaks). The Tenants also questioned that the Landlord only owned the property
for a short time, before wanting to sell; and that the Landlord has tried to get the Tenants to move out.
 
11. It is not for the Board to decide the effect of
missing initials on the agreement, or on what terms and conditions should be
disclosed or included in the sale agreement. The issue for the Board is whether
there is a genuine agreement
for the Landlord to sell the rental
unit to the purchaser; and the
purchaser intends to live in the unit.
 
12. At the hearing, the purchaser’s spouse, KW testified
that he has seen the agreement of purchase and sale and missing initials on the
agreement had no impact on the sale. He has visited the rental property with
his real estate agent. He has viewed 30 to 50 houses over a period of one
month, prior to wanting to purchase this property. The property will provide space
for their 3 children and has a backyard. KW also stated
that the closing
was




 
November 2, 2020 but since they
do not have vacant possession, the closing had been extended and the mortgage
adjusted. They plan to complete the transaction and have no plans to move and considers this their “forever
home”. KW also stated that they would not
be able to afford another property in this price range.
 
13. Based on the evidence before me, I am satisfied on a
balance of probabilities, that the Landlord and the purchaser entered
into a genuine agreement of purchase and sale for the
rental unit. Based on KW’s testimony, I am also satisfied on a balance of probabilities,
that the purchaser intends in good faith to move into the rental unit for
residential occupation.
 
14. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would
not be unfair to postpone the eviction
until February 28, 2022 pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(b)
of the Act. I considered the
length of the tenancy (over 4 years) and Tenants’ family and financial
situation. I also considered that the Landlord has been waiting for some time
for vacant possession.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order SWL-52434-21 issued on July 29, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the following: The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenants is terminated, as of February 28, 2022. The Tenants
must move out of the rental unit on or before February 28, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 1, 2022.
 
4.    
If the Tenants fail to move out of the unit on February 28, 2022, the Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $41.84 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from March 1, 2022 to the date
they move out of the unit.
