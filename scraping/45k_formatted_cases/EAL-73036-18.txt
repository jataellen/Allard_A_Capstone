Review
Order
 
GHC (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict JD (the 'Tenant') because he, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone he permitted in the residential complex
has wilfully caused undue damage to the premises and used
the rental unit or the residential complex in a manner that is inconsistent
with use as a residential premises and that has caused or can be expected to
cause significant damage. The Landlord applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict JD (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was
resolved by order EAL-73036-18 issued on May 18, 2018.
 
On June 18, 2018, the
Tenant requested a review of the order.
 
A preliminary review of
the review request was completed without a hearing by reviewing the file, the
submissions in the request to review and the original order.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
On the basis of the
submissions made in the request, I am not satisfied that there is a serious
error in the order or that a serious error occurred in the proceedings.
2.     
The submissions in the
request to review fail to identify any serious error; the submissions seem to
suggest that the Tenant was not able to put her best arguments forward.
However, the Member who heard the case and observed the participants at the
hearing made reasonable determinations on the basis of the evidence presented.
Reasonable determinations will not be interfered with on review.
3.     
Absent a serious error, the
request to review process is not an opportunity to reargue the case in hopes of
a more favourable outcome, nor is it an opportunity to present evidence and
submissions that could and should have been made at the original hearing.
4.     
The request to review is
denied in accordance with Rule 29.11 (c) of the Board’s Rules of Practice
because the grounds for considering a review are not satisfied.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The request to review order
EAL-73036-18 issued on May 18, 2018 is denied. The order is confirmed and
remains unchanged.
