On July 22, 2021, Katas Inc. (the

1.       
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the
Tenant did not meet certain
condition(s) specified in the order.

I
find that the Tenant has not met the following

thereafter up to and including May 1, 2022. The Tenant failed to pay the full monthly

It is ordered that:

2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move

on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January

file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
4.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 16, 2022.
