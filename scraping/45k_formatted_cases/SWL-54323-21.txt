Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-54323-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


603B, 603 ST., CHARLES STREET BELLE RIVER ON N0R1A0


 




Between:


Brian Schiller


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Amber Drouillard


Tenant



 
 
Brian Schiller (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Amber Drouillard (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's
rent. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard by way
of video conference on December 20, 2021. The
Landlord attended the hearing
and was represented by Melissa
Bradley, Paralegal. The Tenant attended the hearing and was self
represented.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s application is
based on an N8 notice of termination served to the Tenant on August
26, 2021 with a termination date of October
31, 2021. The notice alleges
that the Tenant has been persistently late in paying her rent.
 
2.    
The tenancy is currently on a month-month term with the monthly rent due and payable
on the first day of each month. The
current monthly rent is $640.00
 
3.    
The parties agree that from June 2020 to August 2021 the Tenant
has paid her rent late 10 out of the 15 months. The parties also agree that since serving
the N8 notice, the Tenant has paid no rent from September 2021 to December
2021.
 
4.     The Tenant testified that since March 2021 she has
gone through stress since the passing of her two pets. In August 2021 she was in a
car accident with her boyfriend
who was injured and unable to work or contribute to the monthly rent. The Tenant wishes to reside in the rental
unit as her father is ill and lives in the area.
 
5.     The Tenant provide no
reasons for paying the rent for the months of 2020. When asked
why the Tenant has paid no rent since August 2021, the Tenant stated that it
was because the Landlord served her with both an N4 and N8 notice of termination
and that she was awaiting
an order from the Board regarding the status
of her tenancy. On cross




 
examination, the Tenant stated that she had not put away the funds for these months and as such, was unable to make a lump
sum payment regardless of the Boards order.
 
6.     The Tenant lives alone in the rental
unit and has resided there for approximately 7 years. The Tenant’s
only source of income is Ontario Works which pays the Tenant $733.00.
 
7.     The Tenant requests that the Board allow her to remain
in the rental unit and with the assistance of her parents, she can pay the monthly rent on time going
forward. If ordered evicted, the Tenant would require
approximately 4 months to vacate.
 
8.    
The Landlord is seeking
a standard non-remedial termination order. The Landlord’s legal representative argued that the Landlord
is a small Landlord who requires rental
income to assist in paying the
mortgage.
 
9.     The Landlord’s representative argued that in addition
to being persistently late in paying her rent, the Tenant is also in arrears of rent in the amount of $3,200.00. The parties are currently awaiting a hearing date for
an L1 application.
 
 
Relief from eviction:
 
10.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until March 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
11.  I find it would be unfair to the Landlord to continue
the tenancy as it is unlikely that the Tenant will be able to consistently pay
the rent on time in the future. The Tenant’s monthly income is only $93.00 more
than the monthly rent. When factoring
in monthly living expenses, the Tenant can only afford
to pay the monthly rent on time with additional assistance. The Tenant’s proposal requires her parents
to provide financial assistance, but it is not clear if the Tenant will in fact
be receiving such support, especially considering
the Tenant’s evidence that her father is seriously ill. In addition to being late in paying the rent, the Landlord is
also owed 5 months of rent arrears.
 
12.  I am alive to the fact that the Tenant has resided in
the rental unit for 7 years and is also attempting to care for her sick father. As such, I find
that the delayed termination date will allow the Tenant some additional
time to secure alternate housing. Based
on the evidence before the Board, I find that a termination date of March 31,
2022 is fair to both parties.
 
13.  This Order contains
all the reasons for this matter. No further reasons
will issue.




 
It is
ordered that:
 
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of March
31, 2022. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before March 31, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before
February 14, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 15, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit is not vacated on or before March 31, 2022, then starting April 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
5.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after April 1, 2022.
