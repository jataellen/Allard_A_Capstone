Between:

Landlord




 


and


 




 


Raylene
Norman


Tenant



 
On November 12,
2021, Skyline Living (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Raylene Norman (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the
Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because
the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on September 28, 2021
with respect to application SOL-21818-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following condition
specified in the order:
 
The Tenant was to prevent her
children from running unsupervised in the residential complex and creating
a nuisance for other Tenants
in the residential complex.
 
On October 24, 2021, at approximately 5 pm, a
complaint was received from a Tenant who witnessed
the son of the Tenant
in unit 307 urinating off the balcony. The complaining Tenant’s balcony
is directly below unit 307.
 
3.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,581.63 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
4.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period from December
18, 2020 to January 6, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order SOL-21818-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 17, 2022.




File Number: SOL-26416-21
 
3.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January
18, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
4.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 18, 2022.

The tenant has until January 16, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under

the Board will schedule a hearing.
