and


 




 


 


Tenant




 


Paul Barry


 



 
 
Hazelview Property Services
Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Paul Barry (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Vinuri Sivalingam attended the hearing. As of 10:09 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the
Tenant was required to pay for the period from November 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
September 1, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,059.11.
 
4.     The Tenant paid $6,394.66 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
is not holding a last month's rent
deposit.
 
6.     I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act') including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenant and, find that it would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. Based on an agreement reached by the
parties, the Landlord requested an order with
the conditions outlined below.




 
It is determined that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$3,483.84,
which represents the arrears of rent
$3297.84), and costs $186.00
outstanding for the period ending December 31, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s application for eviction
of the Tenant is denied
on the condition that:
 
(a)  
The Tenant shall make
the following payments to the Landlord in respect of the monies owing under
paragraph 1 of this order:
 



Date Payment Due


Amount of Payment




On or before
January 1,
2022


$1,059.11 (costs and
arrears)




On or before February 1,
2022


$1,059.11 (arrears)




On or before
March 01,
2022


$1,059.11 (arrears)

(b)   The Tenant shall also pay the Landlord
the rent for the months
of January 1, 2022 up to and including April 2022 in full, on or before
the first day of each corresponding month.
 
3.    
If the Tenant fails to
make any of the payments in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates
required, then:
 
(a)  
The Landlord
may apply under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for
an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, and for the payment
of any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not already ordered under paragraph
1 of this order. The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a
breach of a condition set out in paragraph 2 of this order.
 
(b)   The balance owing under paragraph
1 of this order shall become payable
on the day following
the date of default. The monies owing
shall bear interest
at the post- judgment interest rate determined under subsection 207(7)
of the Act.
