Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-25828-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


182 FERRIE
STREET E HAMILTON ON L8L3T5


 




Between:


Izabella Bauer


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Andrea Perry Robert
Bennett


Tenants



 
 
 
L1 Application
Izabella Bauer (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Robert Bennett and Andrea Perry (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
L2 Application
The Landlord also applied for an
order to terminate the Tenancy and evict the Tenants because the Tenants
or another occupant
of the rental unit has committed an illegal act or has carried out, or
permitted someone to carry
out an illegal trade,
business or occupation in the rental unit or the residential complex.
 
 
This application was heard via videoconference on December 14, 2021.
The Landlord and the Tenants attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
L1 Application
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the
total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to December
31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective July 21, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The monthly rent is $1,750.00.




File Number: SOL-25828-21
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,750.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from February
22, 2021 to July 21, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenants paid $1,927.14 after the application was filed.
 
L2 Application
 
7.     The Landlord served an N6 notice of termination on the Tenants
alleging that police
had constantly been called to the rental unit for alleged drug use.
 
8.    
The Landlord failed to produce any witnesses, including any police officers
or any police statements in support of the allegations contained in the
N6.
 
9.     The Landlord testified that the other tenants were
afraid to testify and therefore were unwilling
to appear at the Board
to speak to complains they have made to the Landlord.
 
10.  As a result,
I was not satisfied on a balance
of probabilities that the Landlord
had proven the allegations
contained in the N6 notice of termination. As
a result, the L2 application could not proceed.
 
Summary
 
11.  The Tenant stated
that they were willing to pay the full amount owing and consented to a
standard pay and stay eviction order.
 
12.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
L1 Application
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 5, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $7,096.00*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 25, 2022, less
the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$57.53 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 26, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.




File Number: SOL-25828-21
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or
before February 5, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 6,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 5, 2022, then starting February
6, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 6, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)          
$7,088.60 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)         
$8,838.60 if the payment
is made on or before
February 5, 2022**.
If the
Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 6, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
 
L2 Application
 
10.  The Landlords L2 application based on the N6 notice of termination is dismissed.
