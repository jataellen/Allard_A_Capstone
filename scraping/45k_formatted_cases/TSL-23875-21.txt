Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-23875-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


2405, 1815 YONGE
STREET TORONTO ON M4T2A4


 




Between:


Piera Ho


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Mason Miller Tammy Beggs


Tenants



 
 
 
Piera Ho (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Mason
Miller and Tammy Beggs (the
'Tenants')
 
This application was heard via videoconference on December 7, 2021.
 
Only the
Landlords Agent Lillian Hung attended the hearing. As of 2:04 p.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing,
although properly notified
of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s application was received
by the Board on August
26, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord
served a voidable
N5 notice of termination on June 22, 2021. The voiding
period is June 22-29, 2021. The
termination date was July 14, 2021.
 
3.    
The Landlord
served a second
non-voidable N5 notice
of termination on August 11, 2021.
 
4.    
The Landlord’s second non-voidable N5 contains allegations that predate the first N5 and
predate the voiding period.




File Number: TSL-23875-21
 
 
 
 
5.    
This type of non-voidable N5 notice is served pursuant
to section 68(1)
of the Act which states:
68 (1) A landlord may give a tenant notice
of termination of the tenancy
if,
 




 
and


(a)         
a notice
of termination was given to the tenant
under section 62, 64 or 67;




 
(b)         
more than seven days
but less than six months
after the notice mentioned in clause (a) was given to the tenant, an activity
takes place, conduct occurs or a situation arises that constitutes grounds
for a notice of termination under section 60, 61, 62, 64 or 67, other than an
activity, conduct or a situation that is described in subsection 61 (1) and
that involves an illegal act, trade, business or occupation described in clause
61 (2) (a).[emphasis added]
 
6.    
Therefore
the 2nd N5 is defective and the
application could not proceed on the 1st N5 since the application was filed more than 30 days after the termination date in the 1st N5.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
