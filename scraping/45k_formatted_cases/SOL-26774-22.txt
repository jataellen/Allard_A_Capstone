Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26774-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


21, 8627 LUNDYS LANE NIAGARA FALLS ON L2H1H5


 




Between:


Abid Sohail


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Brian Papetti


Tenant



 
 
 
Abid Sohail (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Brian
Papetti (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent
the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the
order issued by the Board on November 30, 2021 with respect to application
SOL-22574-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain
condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant
has not met the following condition specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $5086.00
arrears on or before December 31, 2021.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $5,086.00 for rent arrears
and the costs
related to the Landlord's application fee in Order SOL-22574-21. The amount that is still
owing from that order is
$5,086.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order SOL-22574-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from December 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.

It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SOL-22574-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 31, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$6,329.15*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to January 20, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$24.66 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 21, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
31, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 31, 2022, then starting
February 1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after February 1, 2022.
 
 
January 20, 2022

The tenant has until January 30, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 30, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
