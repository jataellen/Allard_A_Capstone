File Number:

In the matter

514, 390 DAWES

Between:


Amaz Property Management Inc


Landlord

Catherine Cameron Rice


Tenant



 
 
 
On January 14, 2022, Amaz
Property Management Inc (the 'Landlord') applied in this L4 application for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Catherine Cameron Rice (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant failed to meet a
condition specified in the
consent order issued by the Board on December 15, 2021 with respect
to L2 application TSL-23763-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The previous consent order
provided that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the
Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I find that the Tenant has not met
the following condition specified in the order: On or about January 10, 2022 the Tenant interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the
residential complex for another tenant,
as it was observed urine was dripping
from the Tenant’s unit into the unit below. This was a breach of the
consent order. The L4 application was
filed within 30 days of the breach.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 8, 2022 (standard 11 days from the issuance date of this
order).
 
2.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 8, 2022, then starting February
9, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.




File Number: TSL-26017-22
 
 
 
3.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 9, 2022.
 
 
January 28, 2022

The tenant
has until February
7, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under

stayed and the Board will schedule a hearing.

on or before this date with the Court
