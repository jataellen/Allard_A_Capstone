Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26916-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


23 HAWTHORNE AVENUE
ST. CATHARINES ON L2M6A8


 




Between:


Terence Kelsey Jessica Carlascio


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Crystal Roy Joshua
Vawwaw


Tenants



 
 
 
Terence Kelsey and Jessica
Carlascio (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Crystal
Roy and Joshua
Vawwaw (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
entered into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlords and the Tenants
signed an agreement
to terminate the tenancy as of May 31, 2022.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination
date, it is not appropriate to
require the Tenant to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before May 31, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before May 31, 2022, then starting June 1, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after June 1, 2022.
