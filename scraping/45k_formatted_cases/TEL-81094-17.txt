Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-81094-17
 










 
 
 

R.S.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict D.M., C.M.,
T.U. and B.B. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.  This is an L1 application.
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenants because the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for the
purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation for
each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.  This
is an L2 application.
 
At
the hearing the first-named Tenant applied pursuant to section 82 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2016 (the ‘Act’) for an order determining that the Landlord
entered his rental unit illegally and the Landlord or
the Landlord's superintendent or the Landlord's agent harassed,
obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with them.  This is a
Section 82 application.
 
This
application was heard in Whitby on July 10, 2017.
 
The Landlord and the first-named Tenant attended the hearing.  The
Landlord’s Agent, C.P., also attended the hearing as a witness for the
Landlord.
 
Determinations:
L1
APPLICATION
1.     The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from December 1, 2016 to July 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective May 24, 2017.
2.     The
Tenant at the hearing argued that each Tenant listed had a separate tenancy.  
3.     The
Landlord submitted the lease signed by all four parties.  No other signed
document was submitted by either party.  Although the Landlord’s witness, who
also acts as the Landlord’s agent, did not convey the initial missed payment of
one of the Tenants to all of the Tenants, it is merely poor communication
and/or business practice as all four Tenants are listed on the Notice of
Termination.  
4.     Based
on the evidence provided, I am satisfied the Tenants share a joint tenancy and
all four Tenants listed in the application are responsible for the outstanding
balance.
SECTION
82
5.     The
first-named Tenant stated the Landlord’s Agent entered his rental unit
illegally, without giving proper notice.
6.     The
Agent agrees she entered the rental unit without giving the Tenant any notice
to enter.  The Agent’s reasoning for doing so was because she believed the
Tenants had vacated the rental unit.  The Agent admitted that no keys had been
handed back to her or the Landlord and the Tenants did not give written 60
days’ notice to terminate the tenancy.  
7.     There
was no excuse for the Landlord and/or his Agent to be entering the rental unit
without giving the Tenants proper written notice.  This was a blatant disregard
for the Act as it was clear the Landlord and/or his Agent were aware of the 24
hours written notice requirement under the Act as they had posted notices to
enter on other occasions.  An award of $500.00 is granted to the Tenants.  This
amount is deducted from the overall amount owed from the Tenants to the
Landlord.
8.     The
first-named Tenant claimed the Landlord and/or his Agent harassed him; however,
he led no evidence to prove this claim.  As a result, the claim of harassment
is dismissed.
L2
APPLICATION
9.     The
Landlord in good faith requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation.
10.   The
Landlord testified that he is currently living in the basement unit of another
home and his wife lives upstairs.  Around Christmas time 2016 the Landlord
decided he wished to move into his own house and away from his wife as the
situation is not comfortable living in the same house.
11.  I am
satisfied the Landlord genuinely intends to live in the rental unit once he is
given vacant possession.
12.  The first-named
Tenant request an extension of time to September 2017 to vacate the rental
unit.  The Landlord requested immediate termination.
13.  Due to
the high amount of arrears, to prolong the process for either party would be
detrimental to both.  The Tenants will be given the standard 11 days to vacate
the rental unit and pay the arrears.
14.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
15.  This
order contains all of the reasons for my decision within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.  
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before August 4, 2017.
2.     The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $9,498.02*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to July 24, 2017.
3.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $72.33 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting July 25, 2017 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.     If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before August
4, 2017, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from August 5, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     If
the unit is not vacated on or before August 4, 2017, then starting August 5,
2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after August 5, 2017.
