Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-33521-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


BASEMENT, 49 PICARO
DRIVE TORONTO ON M3N2B6


 




Between:


Minh Phu Thach


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Avenella
Samuel Chanel Samuel


Tenants



 
 
Minh Phu Thach (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Avenella Samuel and Chanel Samuel (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 18, 2021. The Landlord's Legal Representative, Michael Ostroff and
the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from April 1, 2020 to October 31,
2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 7, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is
$1,100.00.
 
4.    
The Tenants
have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,100.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from April 1, 2015 to July 7, 2021.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 18, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$9,202.80*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 7, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $36.16 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 8, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January
18, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from January 19,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January
19, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 19, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 18, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $11,386.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
19, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
