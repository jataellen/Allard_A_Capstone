Review Order
 
King East Developments (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order requiring Rojda Ciyayi (the 'Tenant')
to pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque
charges and related administration charges.
 
This application was resolved
by order SOL-18755-20 issued on October
26, 2021.
 
On November 9, 2021, the Landlord
requested a review of the order alleging the order contained a serious error
because the presiding Member erred by not giving consideration to the lack of
notice of termination given by the Tenant. By not doing so, the Member is
claimed to have erred by not taking into account
subsection 88(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).
The claimed error impacts the resulting quantum of arrears, which then
allegedly renders the dollar amount ordered in the Board Order incorrect.
 
The request
was heard by way of video conference on January 21, 2022. The Landlord’s Legal Representative, Howard Levenson and the Tenant attended
the hearing. The Tenant spoke to Tenant Duty Counsel prior to the commencement of the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Landlord’s Request to Review
 
1.       
The Landlord’s Representative
submitted that the order contains a serious error because the Member never
considered the provisions of subsection 88(1) of the Act which requires the
Tenant to give 60 days notice to terminate the tenancy. If the Tenant fails to
give 60 days notice to the
Landlord, then the Landlord is entitled to seek arrears
of rent to the earliest possible termination
date, which in this matter would have been January 14, 2021. The Landlord’s Representative submitted
that he presented this evidence at the




 
hearing and the Member did not include this consideration in the order issued October 26, 2021.
 
2.       
The Tenant did not challenge the Landlord’s Representative’s evidence with respect
to the request to review the order based on the order containing a
serious error.
 
Findings
 
3.       
I
am satisfied on a balance
of probabilities that the order contains a serious error because
the Member did not include considerations and determinations with respect to
the Landlord’s Representative’s submissions on subsection 88(1) of the Act,
namely the Landlord entitlement to seek arrears of rent to the earliest
possible termination date. Given my finding, the Landlord’s request for review
is granted.
 
New Hearing of Landlord’s L9 Application.
 
Landlord’s Evidence
 
4.         
The Tenant was in possession of the rental
unit on the date the application was filed.
 
5.       
The Tenant rental period
was the 15th to the 14th of each month.
 
6.       
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on November
15, 2020.
 
7.       
The lawful monthly rent was $2,350.00.
 
8.       
The Landlord collected a last
month’s rent deposit in the amount of $2,350 which was collected on September 15, 2019. The tenancy agreement on file confirms
the Landlord collected a last
month’s rent deposit.
 
9.       
The Landlord incurred charges
of $5.00 for a cheque
tendered by or on behalf
of the Tenant, which was
returned NSF and $20.00 for related administration charges.
 
10.   
The Tenant did not pay the total
rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from October 15, 2020 to
November 14, 2020. It is the Landlord’s position that pursuant to subsection
88(1) of the Act, the Landlord is entitled for an order of arrears for the
rental period of October
15, 2020 to January 14, 2021 because
the Tenant did not give 60 days notice to end the tenancy as required
by the Act. The Landlord’s Representative submitted that the Tenant gave her
notice to move out of the rental unit on October 22, 2020 which means the
earliest possible termination date she could have given was January 14, 2021. Subsection 88(1) reads as follows:
 
If a tenant abandons or vacates
a rental unit without giving notice of termination in accordance with this Act
and no agreement to terminate has been made or the landlord has not given notice to terminate the tenancy, a determination of the
amount of arrears of rent owing by the tenant shall be made in accordance with
the following rules:




 
1.    
If the tenant vacated the rental
unit after giving notice that was not in accordance with this Act, arrears of rent are owing for the period
that ends on the earliest termination date that could have been specified in the notice,
had the notice been given in accordance with section 47, 96 or 145, as
the case may be.
11.   
The Landlord’s Representative
submitted that the Landlord did not try to mitigate loss by re-renting the unit
because the Landlord had plans to demolish the residential complex. In fact, the tenancy agreement on file
entered in evidence by Landlord’s Representative states that the tenancy
must terminate by September 14, 2020 because
the Landlord was going to demolish the rental property.
The Landlord’s Representative submitted that the rental property was demolished
in June 2021.
 
12.    The Landlord has also requested the cost ($201.00) of filing the application.
 
Tenant’s Evidence
 
13.   
The Tenant testified that she does
no owe arrears of rent because she had to move out of the rental unit. It is her position that her last month’s
rent deposit covered the rental owed for the rental period of October 15, 2020
to November 14, 2020. She does not
believe she owes rent for November 15, 2020 to January 14, 2021 because she had
no choice but to move out of the rental unit based on the provisions set out by
the Landlord in the rental agreement that she had to move out of the rental
unit by September 14, 2020 and that no extension of the rental
agreement would be considered as the Landlord is going to demolish the rental
property.
 
14.    The Tenant provided her notice to end the tenancy in
writing. A copy of the Tenant’s
notice was entered in evidence and is dated October 22, 2020. The written notices advised the Landlord
that she would be moving out of the rental unit on November 15, 2020. She also reminded
the Landlord that as per the tenancy
agreement, the tenancy was terminated. The Landlord
rejected the Tenant’s notice to terminate the tenancy because she did not give
60 days notice as required by the Act.
 
Findings
 
15.   
On a balance of probabilities I
find the Landlord is not entitled to arrears of rent for the rental period
ending January 14, 2021. In making my finding I considered the provisions of the Act under subsection 16 which requires
a landlord to mitigate their losses. Section 16 of the Act reads as follows:
 
When a landlord or a tenant
becomes liable to pay any amount as a result of a breach of a tenancy
agreement, the person
entitled to claim the
amount has a duty
to take reasonable steps to minimize the person’s losses.
 
16.   
In this circumstance, the
submissions of the Landlord’s Representative indicate that the Landlord never
tried to re-rent the unit to mitigate the loss of rent because the Landlord
planed on demolishing the residential complex.
The complex was not demolished until June 2021, which means the Landlord
had a period of time for which they could have re- rented the unit even on a short-term
basis in order to minimize the loss of rent.




 
17.   
Further, when considering the provisions
of the tenancy agreement which stipulates the Tenant must move out of the rental unit on September
14, 2020 and no
extension of the rental agreement would be granted,
the Landlord effectively gave the Tenant
a notice of termination. This means, the Tenant was not required to give the Landlord 60
days notice to vacate the rental unit. This
is in keeping with the Board’s Interpretation Guideline 11.
 
18.    Given my findings, I further find that the tenancy
terminated on November 15, 2020, being the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord. As such, arrears of rent owed to the Landlord
will be calculated for the period
of October 15, 2020 to November 15, 2020, less the
last month’s rent deposit and plus the NSF fee. Based on these calculations,
the amount owing to the Landlord is the pro-rated rent ($77.00) for November
15, 2020 plus the cost ($201.00) of the fling, plus the NSF fee ($25.00) for a
total of $303.00.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The Landlord’s request for review is granted.
 
2.       
Order SOL-18755-20 issued on October 26, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the
following:
 
3.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$78.00, which represents the amount
of rent owing up to November 15, 2020.
 
4.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$25.00, which represents the total charges related to an NSF cheque tendered
to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant.
 
6.       
If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before February
12, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 13, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
