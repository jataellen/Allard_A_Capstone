Tenant



 
On November 15, 2021 Dunbar
Property Holdings Ii Lp (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Archibald Anderson (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have
the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified in the order TSL-21770-21 issued by the Board on August 4, 2021
with respect to application .
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant
if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenant
failed to pay to the Landlord
$891.25 on or before November
1, 2021 towards rent.
 
3.       
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $1,661.00 for rent arrears in OrderTSL-21770-21. The amount that is still owing from that
order is $61.25 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order TSL-21770-21 is cancelled.
 
5.       
Since the date of the order,
the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from August 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.
 
6.       
Since the date of the order, the
Landlord incurred $40.00 for administration charges related to cheques tendered
by or on behalf of the Tenant,
which were returned
NSF.




 
7.       
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $900.53 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
8.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period from January
1, 2021 to January 7, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
Order TSL-21770-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 18, 2022.
 
3.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $732.56*. This amount represents the rent owing up
to November 30, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
4.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$29.30 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting December 1, 2021 to
the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
18, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January
19, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after January 19, 2022.

The tenant has until January 17, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
