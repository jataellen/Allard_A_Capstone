Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-25364-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1, 114 AVONDALE STREET HAMILTON ON L8L7B8


 




Between:


Jiangping Ding


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


James Howell


Tenant



 
 
Jiangping Ding (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict James Howell (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent.
 
This application was heard by
video conference on February 14, 2022. Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
The Tenant was to participate via a Public Access Terminal (‘PAT’). The notice
of hearing sent to the Landlord and the Tenant provided that the hearing would
begin at 1000. The Tenant was not in
attendance at 1000. The commencement
of the hearing was delayed until 1045, but the Tenant did not attend
to make use of the PAT and was not otherwise
in attendance at the hearing. As a
result, the hearing proceeded based only on the evidence of the Landlord.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
September 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective October 15, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant paid $2,000.00
after the application was filed.
 
3.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 5, 2022.
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$1,748.65*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 22, 2022.




 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord:
(a) $21.37 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 23, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit; and (b) $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before March 5, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 6, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 5, 2022, then starting
March 6, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 6, 2022.
 
7.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
 
i)                   
$2,086.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022, or
 
ii)                 
$2,736.00 if the payment
is made on or before
March 5, 2022**.
 
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after March 6, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make
this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
