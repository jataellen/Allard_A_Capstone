Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-05962-18



 


 


 



 
SI (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict DSW (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on July 12, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, BR and the Tenant’s
mother, (BW) attended the hearing on behalf of the Tenant.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from May 1, 2018 to
July 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective May 24, 2018.
2.     
The monthly rent as of the date of the hearing
is $1,050.00.
3.     
The Tenant moved into the unit in September
2017.
4.     
There was no dispute that the Tenant owes to the
Landlord the amount of $3,340.00, which represents the arrears of rent to July
31, 2018 and the application filing fee.
5.     
The Tenant’s mother, BW
testified that the Tenant fell into arrears because she has been off from work
for the past two months due to minor surgeries. The Tenant is returning to work
next week. 
6.     
The Tenant has a monthly
income of about $1,600.00 from her full time employment; and about $400.00 to
$500.00 from her part-time employment. 
7.     
The Tenant requested relief
and proposed a payment plan for the arrears and for August 2018 rent.
8.     
The Landlord requested a standard order and
submitted that the Tenant did not notify the Landlord about her medical issues
and has not paid rent in over three months.  
9.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. As I stated at the hearing, and over the Landlord’s objection, I
granted the Tenant’s payment plan. I considered the Tenant’s health issues and I
will give the Tenant an opportunity to continue the tenancy by paying the
arrears and rent according to her plan. I also considered that the Tenant’s
mother and uncle will assist the Tenant in making the payments.   
10.   At the hearing I explained to the Tenant’s representative, that the
Tenant must pay the arrears and the rent in accordance with the plan. I also
explained section 78 of the Act and the consequences if the Tenant failed to
make these payments. I was assured that the Tenant’s representative understood
the consequences if the Tenant fails to comply with the plan.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Tenant shall pay the Landlord $3,340.00, which
represents the arrears of rent to July 31, 2018 ($3,150.00), plus the
Landlord’s application filing fee ($190.00).
2.     
The Tenant shall pay the
amount set out in paragraph one, according to the following schedule:
 
                                                On or
before July 31, 2018                          $    700.00 
                                                On or
before August 7, 2018                       $ 2,640.00
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord the
monthly rent for August 2018 as follows: 
                      On or before August 15, 2018                     $   
525.00
                      On or before September 1, 2018                $   
525.00
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay the monthly rent for
September 2018 when it comes due on or before September 1, 2018.  
5.     
If the Tenant fails to make
any of the payments under paragraph two, above, in full, the Landlord may
collect the entire outstanding balance from the amount set out in paragraph
one, immediately. 
6.     
If the Tenant fails to make
the payments under paragraphs two, three, or four, above, in full and on time,
the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (‘the Act’) within 30 days of the breach, without notice to the
Tenant, for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant; and
requiring that the Tenant pays any new arrears and NSF fees and related charges
that become owing after July 31, 2018.
