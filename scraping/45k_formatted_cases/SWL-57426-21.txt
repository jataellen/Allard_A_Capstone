Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57426-21
 



In the matter
of:


310, 405 SUGARCREEK TRAIL LONDON ON N6H0C7


 




Between:


Old Oak Properties Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Taesik Jung Yeonhee Jung


Tenants



 
 
Old Oak
Properties Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Taesik Jung and Yeonhee Jung (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on August 26,
2021 with respect to application SWL-46728-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenants have not met the following
conditions specified in the order: the Tenants did not pay $1,253.66
on or before November 30, 2021 nor did they pay the lawful rent for December on
or before December 1, 2021.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order
required the Tenants
to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenants
were ordered to pay $10,475.71 for rent arrears
and the costs
related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
SWL-46728-20. The amount that is still owing from that order is $4,968.39
and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous
order SWL-46728-20 is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenants
have failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from November 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.




 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,232.86 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
1, 2021 to January 14, 2022.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The previous
order SWL-46728-20 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 25, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$6,241.61*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to December 31, 2021 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $41.22 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 1, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
25, 2022, the Tenants will start
to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from
January 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 25, 2022, then starting January
26, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 26, 2022.
 
 
January 14, 2022

The tenant has until January 24, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 24, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.




 
In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on July 26, 2022 if
the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
