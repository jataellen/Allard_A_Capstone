Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-03320-21



In the matter
of:


UPPER, 24 PROUSE DRIVE BRAMPTON ON L6V3A8


 




Between:


Jaswinder Pal
  Mokha


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Farhana Akther Chowdhury Mohammed Rashed


 
Tenants



 
 
Jaswinder Pal Mokha (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Mohammed Rashed and Farhana
Akther Chowdhury (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video
conference on February 7, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal
Representative, Jaswinder Pal Mokha, attended the hearing. As of 11:58 a.m., the Tenants
were not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the
Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 29, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
3.    
The lawful monthly rent is $2,300.00.
4.    
The Tenants have made no payments
since the application was filed.
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,300.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in
accordance with section 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord
attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.

6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before

the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:

is made on or before
February 28, 2022,
or
ii)  
$16,286.00 if the payment
is made on or before March 5, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not make full
payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline,
then the Landlord
may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March 6, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once
during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
