Margery Chapman
  Shawn Chapman


Tenants



 
 
 
Lady Brantford Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Shawn Chapman and Margery Chapman (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 1, 2022. Only
the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Jackie Struthers, attended the hearing. As
of 10:50 a.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from January 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective September 30, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,499.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant
paid all arrears
for the period ending
February 28, 2022, after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The only amount outstanding is the Landlord's cost of filing
the application. As a result, the order will be limited to costs
only and not eviction.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.




File Number: SOL-25392-21
 
2.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing on
or before February 19, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 20,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
