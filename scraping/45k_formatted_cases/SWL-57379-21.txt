Between:

and


 




 


Michael Thompson


Tenant



 
 
 
Watford Optimist Non-profit
Housing Cor (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Michael Thompson (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay
the costs related to the application fee for the previous application the
Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order
issued by the Board on January 22, 2021
with respect to application SWL-41173-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following condition
specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $289.00 (rent) on
or before November 1, 2021.
 
3.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $190.00
for the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order SWL-41173-20. The amount that is
still owing from that order is
$190.00 and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the
previous order SWL-41173-20 is cancelled.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
SWL-41173-20 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 17, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$190.00*. This amount
represents the costs related
to the application fee for the previous application.

4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$9.50 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 7, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
January 17, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
January 18, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January
18, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 18, 2022.

The tenant has until January 16, 2022 to file a motion with the Board

under
s. 77(6) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 16, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction

the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
