Order under Sections 69,
77 and 89
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-95457-18
 











 
 
 

S. M. and A. S. (the 'Landlords') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict D. L. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did
not pay the rent that the Tenant owes and because the Tenant entered into an
agreement to terminate the tenancy. 
 
The Landlords also applied for an order requiring the
Tenant to pay compensation for the damages caused by the Tenant or a person the
Tenant permitted in the residential complex
 
This application was heard in Toronto on November 16,
2018. 
 
The Landlords and the Tenant
attended the hearing. 
 
 
Determinations:
 
THE APPLICATION FOR DAMAGES
 
1.     
The Landlords applied for an
order pursuant to section 89 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') requiring the Tenant to pay compensation for
the damages caused by the Tenant. 
2.     
The portion of the
application relating to the alleged damage does not contain any dates, times or
details of the alleged damage. It is unclear from the application what areas of
the rental unit are damaged and how the Tenant allegedly caused those areas of
damage. 
3.     
As I pointed out at the
hearing, the application failed to contain specific dates, times or details
regarding the Tenant’s alleged behaviour it fails to comply with the applicable
legal principles contained in the Divisional Court’s decision in Ball v.
Metro Capital Property, [2002] O.J. No. 5931. This case stands for the
proposition that the kinds of particulars that should be contained in an
application notice which is about a tenant’s behaviour should include “dates
and times of the alleged offensive conduct together with a detailed description
of the alleged conduct engaged in by the tenant”. As I explained to the
Landlord, the application here does not meet this requirement.
4.     
I also explained that the
Tenant has the right to know the allegations before the hearing so they can be
prepared to defend the application. For these reasons, I find that the application
does not comply with the applicable legal principles and this portion of the
Landlord’s application is dismissed. 
THE APPLICATION BASED ON AN AGREEMENT TO
TERMINATE 
5.     
As the hearing progressed,
it became clear that the parties had reached an oral agreement to terminate the
tenancy effective October 31, 2018. The Tenant failed to move out of the unit
pursuant to the agreement she had with the Landlord. 
6.     
As I am satisfied that the
parties reached an agreement to terminate the tenancy, the Landlord’s
application must be granted. The only question before me is whether it would be
fair in all the circumstances pursuant to subsection 83(2) of the Act to delay
or deny the eviction. An analysis of this issue is contained below. 
THE APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
7.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from September 1, 2018
to December 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of
Termination effective September 24, 2018.
8.     
The outstanding arrears
owing for the period ending November 30, 2018, total $3,300.00. 
9.     
The Landlord paid $190.00
for the costs of filing the application and the Landlord is entitled to be
reimbursed for those costs. 
10.  
The Tenant is seeking relief
from eviction in the form of a delay until December 31, 2018. The Tenant lives
alone in the rental unit and did not disclose any reasons that would justify a
delay of that length. I have also considered that, due to the passage of time,
the Tenant has already experienced a lengthy delay from the date she originally
agreed to vacate the unit on October 31, 2018.
11.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that: 
1.   
The tenancy between the
Landlords and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before December 21, 2018.
2.   
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlords $2,542.41*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to December 10, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
3.   
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $36.16 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
December 11, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.   
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.   
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before December 21, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
December 22, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.   
If the unit is not vacated
on or before December 21, 2018, then starting December 22, 2018, the Landlords
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.   
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords,
on or after December 22, 2018.
