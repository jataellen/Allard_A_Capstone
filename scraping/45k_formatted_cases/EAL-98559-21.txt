Nsimba


Tenants




 
 
 
Capreit Limited Partnership (the
'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jean Bosco Bampembe
Ngilima Nsimba and Achilles Lukusa (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 18, 2022. Only the Landlords’ representative, Allan
Kouri, attended the hearing. As of 2:25 p.m.,
the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from October 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords
served a Notice of Termination effective October 31, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent for the unit is
$1,968.34.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants paid $2,850.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the
parties and whether the Landlord
attempted to negotiate
a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to
grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act




File Number: EAL-98559-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before February 8, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $4,953.34*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 28, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlords
$64.71 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 29, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before February
8, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 9, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 8, 2022, then starting February
9, 2022, the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 9, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenants
wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlords or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$5,139.34 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$7,107.68 if the payment
is made on or before February 8, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not make full
payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline,
then the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 9, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlords. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
