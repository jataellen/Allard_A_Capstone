On November 17, 2021,
351 Murray Street
Holdings Corp. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Julie Wray (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the
Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on

The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant
if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed to pay to the Landlord
$863.00 on or before November
1, 2021 towards rent.
 
3.       
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $186.00 for in Order SWL-48811-21. The amount has been paid in full. As a result, the

the Landlord incurred
charges of $25.00
for a cheque tendered by or on behalf of the Tenant which was
returned NSF.

The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $800.00 from the Tenant

is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 21, 2022.

by $869.52.
