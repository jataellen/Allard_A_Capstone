of:


1ST FLOOR, 158 ARDWICK BOULEVARD NORTH YORK ON M9M1W2

Prateek Aggarwal


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Nasir Warraich


Tenant



 
Prateek Aggarwal (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict Nasir Warraich (the 'Tenant') because the
Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard via video/teleconference on November 18, 2021.
 
The Landlord, the Tenant and the Tenant's Legal Representative Kimberley
Farrell attended the hearing.
 
Co-Landlord Pitjush
Aggarwal was also in attendance as was the Tenant’s son Shaukat Ibraham who provided interpretative
services to the Tenant.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     This is an application under
section 48(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act).
2.    
Subsection 48(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2006 (‘the Act’) which states in part:
“a landlord
may, by notice, terminate a tenancy if the landlord
in good faith requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation by
(a)  the landlord,
(b)  the landlord’s spouse, or
(c)  a child or parent
of the landlord or the landlord’s spouse.
 
3.     On May 29, 2021 a Co-Landlord gave the Tenant a (N12)
Notice to End the Tenancy setting out that a Landlord
requires possession of the rental
unit for the following reason.
•        
use by a
Landlord.
 
4.     The termination date in the (N12) notice
was July 31, 2021.
5.    
The Tenant did not move out of the rental unit in accordance with the termination date set out in the
notice given.




 
6.    
The Landlord intending to take possession of the rental
unit filed a declaration affirming his good faith intention to
take possession of the rental unit for personal use for a minimum of one year.
7.    
The Landlords submitted
documentation that the compensation was provided to the Tenant by the issuance
of a personal cheque payable
to the Tenant in an amount equal to
one month’s rent dated July 28, 2021 and was delivered to the Tenant
at the address of the rental unit by special courier on July 27, 2021.
 
8.     The technical requirements for granting an application under section 48 of the Act are
(a)  
The Notice:
 
48(2) The date for termination specified in a notice shall be at least 60
days after the notice is given and shall be the day a period of the tenancy ends or,
where the tenancy is for a fixed term, the end of the term.
(b)  
Declaration or Affidavit
 
Subsection 72(1) of the Act requires
the Landlord to file an affidavit/declaration sworn by
the person who personally requires the rental unit and that person certifying that they in good faith
requires the rental unit for his or her own personal use for at least one year.
(c)  
Compensation
 
Section 48.1 of the Act requires
a landlord who has served a tenant with an N12 notice pursuant to section 48 to pay
compensation to the tenants in an amount equal to one month’s rent.
Section 55.1 of
the Act requires the compensation must be paid no later than on the termination date specified in the N12 notice of termination given
by the Landlord under
section 48.
 
9.     On the face of the documents evidence
submitted, I find the Landlord
has met all the technical
requirements pursuant to section 48 of the Residential Tenancies Act.
✔ 
The N12 notice to end the tenancy was deemed properly
given.
 
✔ 
A
Declaration was filed
by the Landlord intending to take possession of the rental unit
 
✔ 
Compensation was deemed
provided to the Tenant, ableit
not yet tendered.
 
10.  The Landlord requested a standard order to termination of the tenancy.
 
11.  The Tenant testified that there was a previous proposed agreement to extend
termination of the tenancy up to June 30, 2022.
 
12.  The Landlord(s) acknowledged that there was an earlier
discussion on extending the termination date to June 30, 2022 but the Tenant
refused to extend a lease agreement to that end.




 
 
 
13.  The Landlord is requesting a standard order but was also amicable
to an extension/postponement
of time to end the tenancy to June 30, 2022.
 
14.  The Tenant's Legal Representative was not agreeable to
a determined termination date of June 30, 2022 and requested that the Landlord’s application be dismissed
on technical grounds, that in
my view were just that technical and would not have been fatal.
 
15.  In making findings on an application, I am mindful of
section 202 of the Act that empowers me to determine the real substance
of all transactions and activities pertaining to a rental unit with respect to this tenancy from
its onset.
 
16.  I was satisfied that overtime leading up to the issuance of the N12 notice, it was clear to the parties that Prateek
Aggarwal was the primary 'Landlord' and he fully intended at some point of time in the future to take possession of the rental unit for his own personal
use and occupant.
 
17.  All in all, after considering all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), I find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction
until April 30, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act to allow the
Tenant and his family additional time to find alternative accommodation.
 
18.  The order contains
all the reasons for the decision within
the order. No other reasons
will be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
April 30, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
April 30, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before April 30, 2022, then starting May 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after May 1, 2022.
