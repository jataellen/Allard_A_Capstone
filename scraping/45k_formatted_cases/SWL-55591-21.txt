Centurion Property Associates Inc
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kevin Deschenes
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This
application was heard by videoconference on January 20, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Robert Rose attended
the hearing. As of 2:15 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to December
31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 29, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on December
15, 2021. The Tenant was in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.      The lawful monthly
rent was $1,076.00.
 
4.      The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,076.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from September 16, 2020 to September 29, 2021.

3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.

the full amount
owing* on or before
