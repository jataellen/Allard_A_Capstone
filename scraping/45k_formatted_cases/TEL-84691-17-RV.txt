Order under Section 21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-84691-17-RV
 










 

Review Order
 
T.K.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict N.K.
and R.B. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
At
the hearing the Tenants applied pursuant to section 82 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order determining that the Landlord failed
to meet the Landlord's maintenance obligations under the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act') or failed to comply with health, safety, housing or
maintenance standards.
 
This
application was resolved by order TEL-84691-17 issued on December 19, 2017.
 
On
January 12, 2018, the Tenants requested a review of the order.
 
The
request was heard in Belleville on February 1, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenants attended the hearing.  S.B. (the
‘Witness’) also attended the hearing as a witness for the Landlord.
 
Determinations:
REQUEST
FOR REVIEW
1.     The
sole ground for the request for review is that the Tenants were not reasonably
able to participate in the hearing held on November 16, 2017.
2.     At
the hearing, the Landlord consented to the request for review; therefore, the
review is granted and the application is heard in full.
APPLICATION
FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
3.     The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from March 1, 2017 to November 30, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective September 26, 2017.
4.     The
Tenants paid $825.00 after the application was filed.
TENANTS
SECTION 82 ISSUES
5.     At
the hearing, the Tenants brought forward issues regarding the maintenance of
the road in the residential complex and the quality of the water.
Road
Maintenance
6.     The
Tenants testified that the gravel roads in the residential complex, which is a
trailer park, have pot holes and they believe the roadway should be paved.
7.     The
Landlord does not deny there have been pot holes in the road.
8.     The
Witness is the Superintendents significant other and lives on the property with
the Superintendent.  She corroborated the Landlord’s testimony and stated that
the Superintendent maintains the roadway on a continuous basis and puts gravel
in any pot holes he is aware of.  The Witness went on to say that the roadway
had also been graded in the spring of 2017.
9.     The
Tenants agreed the Superintendent fills the pot holes but they believe it is
not enough to fix the issue.  The Tenants claimed there was a very large pot
hole in front of the mailboxes.  The Witness did not validate this claim and
said she did not know of such a pot hole.
10.  The
Tenants submitted pictures of the road that show pot holes in the roadway
filled with gravel.  Some of the pot holes are muddy.  The Tenants did not
submit a photograph of the very large pot hole they claim to be in front of the
mailboxes.  I draw an adverse inference from the lack of this photograph and I
am not prepared to determine the pot hole is present and/or large as the
Tenants stated.
11.  Regarding
this issue, the Board must determine whether the Landlord is maintaining the
roadway.  The roadway is dirt and gravel and the parties agree the
Superintendent has been filling pot holes as they happen.  The Board is not
prepared to force the Landlord to undertake a major expenditure as they
Landlord has not failed to maintain the roadway.  
12.  As a
result, this item claimed by the Tenants is denied.
Water
Quality
13.  The
parties agree there was an issue with the drinking water in the trailer park.
14.  The
Landlord submitted a copy of the letters from the H.P.E.P.H. (‘Public Health’)
and an email from S.E.C.I. (‘Consulting Company’) regarding the drinking
water.  The email is dated September 19, 2017 and states the water is not
drinkable due to a high level of benzene.
15.  The first
letter from Public Health dated September 21, 2017 confirms the water is not
drinkable.  The Tenants submitted a copy of a letter from Public Health which
advises the Tenants not to drink this water.  The Tenants said they spoke to
someone and they were told they should not bathe or shower in the water
either.  The Tenants claim they had to go to a hotel during the water issue for
this reason.
16.  I find it
difficult to understand why Public Health would not include this restriction in
their Drinking Water Advisory letter to the Tenants if this were the
situation.  I am not satisfied the Tenants had to go to a hotel instead of
staying in their home.
17.  During
the drinking water restriction from Public Health the Landlord supplied bottled
water to all of the tenants at the trailer park.
18.  On
October 17, 2017 Public Health cleared the drinking water viable again and
lifted the drinking water advisory.
19.  At the
hearing, the Tenants asked when the water was tested.  The Landlord submitted a
summary of the sampling results for 2017 from the Consulting Company.  The
summary clearly shows regular testing of the water for various items throughout
the 2017 year as required under the Safe Drinking Water Act, 2002,
Ontario Regulation 170/03.
20.   In this
situation the Landlord mitigated the situation by having drinking water on hand
for all of the tenants during the Drinking Water Advisory.  The Landlord also
communicated with the Tenants directly after receiving a message from the
first-named Tenant.  the Landlord told the Tenants that if they required more
bottled water they are to ask the Superintendent at any time.  
21.  Given all
of the above, I am satisfied the Landlord maintained the water and performed
the necessary testing pursuant to the applicable legislation.  When the
Landlord found out of the deficiency of the drinking water the Landlord
provided the Tenants with bottled water.  
22.  As a
result of all of the above, the Tenants’ section 82 application is dismissed.
23.  The
Tenants requested 3 months to pay the amount outstanding or years to move.  The
Tenants did not elaborate on the reason for requiring 3 months to pay the
arrears of rent.  If the Tenants were simply withholding their rent, it would
be reasonable to believe the money is available to pay the rent.  The request
of ‘years to move’ is also unreasonable and would be highly prejudicial to the
Landlord.
24.  The first-named
Tenant testified to ailments she experiences and she provided a medical record
which lists the Tenant’s current medial problems.  She also stated she has a
high risk of aneurysm if she falls as her balance is off.  For these reasons,
an order shall issue delaying termination until April 30, 2018.  The Tenants
have the opportunity to pay the amount pursuant to this order and remain void
the order or vacate the property. 
25.  I have
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until April 30, 2018 pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
26.  This
order contains all of the reasons for my decision within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.  
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order
TEL-84691-17 issued on December 19, 2017 is cancelled and replaced by the
following: 
2.     Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before April 2, 2018.
3.     The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $1,955.53*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to March 22, 2018 and less the amount of the {abatement/rebate}
the Landlord owes the Tenants.
4.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $10.85 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting March 23, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
5.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
6.     If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 2, 2018, then starting April 3,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 3, 2018.
8.     If
the Tenants wish to void this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)       $2,253.00 if the payment is made on or before March 31, 2018, or
ii)      $2,583.00 if the payment is made on or before April 30, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after April 3, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
