This order has been amended to correct a typographical error.
 
New Hope Community Housing
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and
evict Brendon Barrault and Sarah Bachiu (the 'Tenants') because they, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or
another tenant.
The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained
in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653#
on January 5, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s Representative, Dale Skvereckas, the Tenants and the Tenants’
Representative, Jathusan Ratnakumaran attended the hearing. Joan Koob,
the Property Manager for the Landlord attended as a witness.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord issued the N5 Notice because the Tenants’
dogs were not secured in accordance with the JK’s instructions on June 30,
2021, and July 14, 2021. The N5 Notice informs the Tenants they have seven days
to void the order and that a further attempt to inspect and do maintenance in
the unit would be made on August 17, 2021. The
Landlord filed the L2 application because they believe the Tenants did not void the
N5 Notice in the seven-day voiding period from August 11, 2021 to August 17,
2021.
 
2.     JK testified and referred to email communication from
the Tenant that states the dogs don’t like her (July 10, 2021 at 6:45 pm.). The
dogs are a breed that are very territorial (email January 22, 20219 at 8:13 am)
and the Tenants do not dispute they have a sign posted warning people to beware
of dogs at the entrance of their unit. A Board
mediated agreement SOT-03487-19 dated
June 17, 2019 included a condition that the Tenants
will




File Number: SOL-24504-21-AM
 
“crate their dogs and one of the Tenants
will be present when the Landlord performs maintenance or inspection in the
unit”.
 
3.     On August 17, 2021, JK did not enter the unit because
the dogs were in the unit. The Tenants testified the dogs were in the spare
room behind a close door, chained, wearing a pinch collar, muzzled and were
accompanied by their dog walker. JK refused to enter when the Tenants confirmed
the dogs were in the unit. Although JK has
safety concerns, I find the Tenants adequately confined their dogs and voided
the N5 Notice. I do not find the Tenants substantially interfere with the Landlord’s rights
to inspect or do maintenance in the unit.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
