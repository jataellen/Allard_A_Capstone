Order under Section 87(1)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-03029-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


110 ATHABASKA ROAD BARRIE ON L4N8E6


 




Between:


Mauricio Higuera


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Amanda Kirton
  David Poole


Tenants



 
 
 
Mauricio Higuera
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Amanda
Kirton and David Poole (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 17, 2022. The Landlord and the Landlord’s
representative, Thomas Schoenleber, attended the hearing. As of 2:17 p.m., the
Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      
The Tenants were in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
2.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from April 1, 2020 to January 31,
2022.
 
3.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
4.     The monthly rent is $1,700.00.
 
5.     The Tenants have paid $11,900.00 since the application was filed.
 
6.    
Upon review of the Notice of
Termination (N4) it was determined amounts were improperly identified as rent for the months
of August and September 2021, rendering the N4 defective. Consequently, at the
request of the Landlord’s
representative, the only part of the application that proceeded was the claim
for rent arrears. As a result, the order will be limited to rent arrears and
costs only, not eviction.
