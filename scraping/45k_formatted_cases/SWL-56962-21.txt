In the matter of:


35 COUNTRY LANE LONDON ON N5Y2H4


 




Between:


Kipps Lane
Property Management Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kathrina Searson
  Natasha Searson


Tenants



 
 
 
Kipps Lane Property Management
Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kathrina
Searson and Natasha
Searson (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants, another occupant
of the rental unit or someone the Tenants permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the
Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard via video conference on February 17,
2022.
 
Only the Landlord’s legal
representative, Luisa Goncalves, attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s application is based on a second
N5 notice of termination. I am satisfied that both the first and second
N5 notices meet the mandatory requirements of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act') and are valid.
 
2.    
For the following reasons, I find
that the Tenants have substantially interfered with the Landlord’s lawful
right, privilege or interest. I say this because the Tenants have failed to maintain the rental unit in an ordinary
state of cleanliness and the debris throughout the rental unit could be
considered a fire hazard.
 
3.    
In support of their application, the Landlord provided the Board with several pictures of various rooms
in the rental unit taken over several
months. These pictures
confirm that the rental unit
was extremely cluttered with garbage, clothes, furniture and assorted
belongings beginning in December 2020. It appears from the pictures that the Tenants made some progress in cleaning unit after they were
served with the first N5 notice of termination. However, the unit has once
again deteriorated to such a state that the




 
Tenants’ belongings have filled
the basement and include bags of garbage,
clothes and other belongings.
 
4.    
Based on the evidence
before me, I am satisfied
that the Tenants’
inability to maintain
the unit in an ordinary state of cleanliness substantially interferes
with the Landlord’s lawful right, privilege or interest. The Landlord’s
application must therefore be granted.
 
5.    
I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'). In particular, I have considered the Landlord’s request
for a conditional order, subject to the Landlord’s right to file an application for eviction in the event of a breach
by the Tenants. For this reason,
I find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction
subject to the conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a)
and 204(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
For the period beginning March 1, 2022, to February
28, 2023, the Tenants shall adhere
to the following conditions as outlined on the second N5 notice of termination.
In particular, the Tenants shall:
 
a)  
Remove all garbage from the basement;
b)  
Regularly remove garbage from the rental
unit;
c)   
Wash the rental unit floors on a regular basis;
d) 
Reduce the amount of clothing and belongings on the floor of the rental unit such
that a normal path of egress can be accessed and the clutter is no longer
considered a fire hazard;
e)    
Ensure that any and all grease is cleaned
from behind the fridge, stove
and on the walls.
 
2.    
If the Tenants fail to adhere to
any of the conditions outlined in paragraph 1 of this order, the Landlord may,
without notice to the Tenants, apply to the Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants. The Landlord
must make this application no later than 30 days after the Tenants’ failure to
make a payment.
 
3.    
On or before March 7, 2022,
the Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the costs of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before March 7, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated
from March 8, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
