as Respondents)




 
 
On January 13, 2022, Osgoode
Properties (the 'Landlord') applied in L4 application (file number EAL-99223-22) for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Darlene
Huntley and Krystin Northmore (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified in the hearing order issued by the Board on
September 28, 2021 with respect to L2 application EAL-92191-20.
 
The L2 hearing order is currently under preliminary review.
The preliminary review hearing is scheduled for March 4,
2022.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The L2 hearing order provided in paragraph 3 that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without
notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants did not meet certain
condition(s) specified in that order.
 
2.       
On December 31, 2021, the Board
issued an Interim Order in the previous L2 application EAL-92191-20-RV-IN
because the Tenants alleged there was a serious error with the hearing order
with respect to the number
of tenants in the
tenancy. No stay was imposed on the
L2 hearing order because no eviction was contemplated by that order.
 
3.       
On January 13, 2022, the Landlord applied in this L4 application for an exparte
eviction order, claiming
that a behavioural breach occurred
of a condition in the L2 hearing order which warranted
eviction based on section 78. They
also




File Numbers: EAL-99223-22 & EAL-92191-20_RV_IN2
 
claimed an eviction order could be made since the preliminary review was only to
determine the limited
issue of which Tenant(s) should
be listed on the order.
 
4.       
Although the preliminary review
may be limited to the scope of the number of tenants, the fact remains that the
style of cause remains unknown at this time whether only 1 Tenant or both should remain on any
further orders made by
the Board with respect to this tenancy.
 
5.       
Rule 26.11 of the Board’s Rules of Procedure allow the Board to issue a
stay of an order, on its own
initiative, at any time during the review process. Rule 26 does not
differentiate or allow only certain portions or terms of an order to be stayed – it mentions
“the order” which
I interpret in the plain
and ordinary sense to mean an entire order, not
portions of it.
 
6.       
Although the Landlord claimed in
the Declaration to the L4 application that an eviction can be issued upon
breach of the hearing order since no stay of the hearing order was imposed by
the Interim Order in that matter, it would not be procedurally fair at this
stage (with the preliminary review pending) to issue any further final determinations with respect to the L2 matter while it is under review.
 
7.       
In accordance with Rule 26,11, I am staying
the L2 hearing order EAL-92191-20 until the Member hearing the
preliminary review either confirms or amends the order or makes any other
determinations.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The Landlord’s L4 application
under section 78 of the Act is dismissed. Any
alleged breach of the consent order will not be considered at this time since
the L4 application was filed after a preliminary review was already
granted of the L2
hearing order.
 
2.       
Order EAL-92191-20 is stayed until further determination by the Board.
