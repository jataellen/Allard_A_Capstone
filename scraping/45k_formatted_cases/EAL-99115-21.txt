Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-99115-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


502, 252 SACKVILLE STREET TORONTO ON M5A3E9


 




Between:


Toronto Community Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Eva Gabris


Tenant



 
 
 
Toronto
Community Housing Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Eva Gabris (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on February 12, 2021 with respect to application HOL- 07162-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the
following condition specified in the order: the Tenant agreed to maintain the unit in a safe clean and
reasonable living condition free of debris and clutter for the remainder of
their tenancy. On December 3, 2021, the Landlord completed an inspection of the
rental unit and observed that the
unit was in a hazardous, cluttered condition. As required by paragraph 15 of
the previous order, the Landlord issued a warning
letter to the Tenant on December 6, 2021 informing
them that they were
in breach of the previous order and that
they were provided 7 days to
rectify the situation. The same information was communicated via email to the
Tenant’s Legal representative on December 6, 2021. A follow up inspection on December 14, 2021 showed that the unit
remained in a hazardous, cluttered condition. In failing to maintain a safe
clean and reasonable living condition the Tenant has breached the conditions of
the previous order issued by the Board.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 25, 2022.




File Number: EAL-99115-21
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 25, 2022, then starting January
26, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 26, 2022.

The tenant has until January 24, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 24, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.
 
In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on July 26, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction
where the rental unit is located.
