and


 




 


Hussein Said


Tenant



 
Margoma Holdings c/o Briarlane
Rental (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy of Hussein Said (the
'Tenant'), and for compensation for the use of the rental unit.
 
This application
was heard via video/teleconference on November 25, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative David Ciobotaru attended
the hearing.
As of 1:07 p.m.,
neither the Tenant Hussein Said (HS) nor was the unauthorized occupant
Aden Farah (AF) present or represented at the hearing although properly
served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
1.    
The Landlord became aware that the
Tenant Hussein Said had moved out of the unit on or about June 30, 2020 when
the Landlord received a letter from Rexdale Community Legal Clinic
on July 8, 2020 that an Aden Farah remained
in possession of the rental
unit and was to be considered an implied Tenant of the unit.
 
2.     The Landlord's Legal
Representative submitted a copy of the tenancy
agreement entered into between
the Landlord and the Tenant Hussein Said (HS) as at July 14, 2016. The tenancy
agreement clearly identified Hussein Said as the Tenant and an Aden Farah as an
occupant.
3.    
The tenancy agreement also clearly set out
Under Clause 15: - the Tenant
acknowledges the right of the Landlord to consent to the assignment of the Rental
Premises. The Tenant covenants not to assign the Rented Premises
without first requesting, in writing, and receiving written leave of the
Landlord to do so.
 
Under Clause 16: - The Tenant
covenants not to sublet the Rented Premises without first requesting, in writing, and obtaining the Landlord’s written
consent to sublet
the Rented premises.
 
4.     Prior to vacating
the rental unit, the Tenant
at no time advised or made a request to the
Landlord to assign or sublet the unit to Aden Farah.




 
5.    
The Landlord's Legal Representative asserts that the Tenant transferred the occupancy of the
rental unit to ADEN FARAH (hereinafter called the 'Unauthorized Occupant') in a
manner that was not authorized by the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'). The Landlord did not enter into a tenancy agreement with this person.
 
6.     Based on the uncontested application, and after
considering all of the disclosed circumstances
I find that Aden Farah,
is an Unauthorized Occupant of the rental
unit.
 
7.     The Unauthorized Occupant
was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
8.     The Landlord is entitled to compensation for the use and occupation of the rental
unit by the Unauthorized
Occupant.
 
9.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated as of June 30, 2020, the date the Tenant moved out of the
rental unit.
 
2.    
The Unauthorized Occupant shall move out of
the rental unit on or before December
31, 2021.
 
3.     If the unit is not vacated by December 31, 2021, then
starting January 1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (the Sheriff), so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
4.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord after January 1, 2022.
 
5.     The Unauthorized Occupant shall also pay to the
Landlord $34.68 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from
July 1, 2020 to the date they move out of the unit.
 
6.     The Unauthorized Occupant
shall pay the Landlord the full amount
owing by December 31, 2021.
 
7.     If the Unauthorized Occupant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing by December 31, 2021, he will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 1,
2022 at 2.00% on the outstanding balance.




 
8.    
If the Unauthorized Occupant does
not pay the Landlord the full amount owing by December 31, 2021, the Landlord shall have the right, at any time, to collect from the Aden Farah, the Unauthorized Occupant the full amount owing
or any balance outstanding under this order.
