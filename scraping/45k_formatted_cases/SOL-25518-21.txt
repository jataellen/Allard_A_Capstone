VIP Investments Limited


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jason Robert Deiter


Tenant



 
 
 
 
VIP Investments Limited (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jason Robert Deiter (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 8, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative,
Julian Shumka, attended the hearing. As of 10:18 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from August 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective August 26, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on November
16, 2021. The Tenant was in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,095.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,095.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from January 1, 2020 to
August 26, 2021.




File Number: SOL-25518-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of November
16, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,068.13*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to November
16, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 25, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
