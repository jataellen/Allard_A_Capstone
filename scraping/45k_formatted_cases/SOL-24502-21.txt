Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24502-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


A, 23 CONROY
CRES GUELPH ON N1G2V5


 




Between:


Livia Basciano


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Shawn Beattie


Tenant



 
 
 
Livia Basciano
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Shawn
Beattie (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This
application was heard via videoconference on January 5, 2022. The Landlord’s
legal representative, A. Sweet, the Landlord and the Tenant attended the
hearing. The Tenant had an opportunity to speak with Tenant Duty Counsel before
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The N12 was served
on the Tenant on June 1, 2021.
The termination date on the notice is July 31, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord did not pay the
Tenant compensation equivalent of one month’s rent by the termination date or
offer an alternative unit. The Landlord submitted that $900.00 was offered to
the Tenant as compensation. However, the Tenant did not respond to the
Landlord’s offer and therefore $900.00 was not given. Further, the Tenant was
in arrears and therefore, the Landlord waived August 2021 rent as compensation.
The Landlord submitted that an L1 application was filed, bearing
file number SOL-26305-21, establishing that the Tenant is in arrears. In the L1
application, there is no claim for August 2021 rent.
 
3.    
Section 48.1 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
“Act’) states as follows:
 
A landlord
shall compensate a tenant in an amount
equal to one month’s rent or offer the tenant another rental
unit acceptable to the tenant
if the landlord gives the tenant
a notice of termination of the tenancy under section 48.




File Number: SOL-24502-21
 
4.    
Section 55.1 of the Act requires
this compensation to be paid no later than on the termination date specified in
the notice of termination of the tenancy.
 
5.    
The waiver of rent arrears
equivalent to one month’s rent meets the requirement of compensation pursuant
to section 48.1 of the Act. However,
the waiver of rent arrears
must be done no later than the termination date specified in the notice
of termination of the tenancy pursuant to section 55.1 of the Act. The
Landlords waived August 2021 rent as evidenced
by the L1 application. August
2021 is after the termination date of July 31, 2021. As compensation was not paid by the
termination date, I am unable to terminate the tenancy. The Landlord’s
application is dismissed, and my order will issue accordingly.
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.    
The Landlord's application is dismissed.
