Review Order
 
1717068 Ontario
Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Steven Blake (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent he
owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on June 14, 2021
with respect to application SOL-19410-21.
 
This application was resolved by order SOL-23293-21 issued on August
13, 2021. On September 9,
2021, the Tenant requested a review of the order.
The request
was heard by videoconference on December 17, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s
personal representative, Roger Kanthiah, the Landlord’s legal representative,
Curtis Begg, the Tenant, and the Tenant’s
legal representative, Kimberley Farrell, attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
Order SOL-19410-21 required the Tenant
to pay the Landlord $300.00
on the 20th of each month starting June 20, 2021 and the monthly rent on the first
of each month starting July 1, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord
filed an ex parte application on July 21, 2021 at approximately 1:00 p.m.
on the basis that the Tenant breached order SOL-19410-21 by not making the
payment due on July 20, 2021. The
Tenant had made this payment at
approximately 9:00 a.m. on July 21, 2021.
 
3.    
The Tenant paid the rent for August 2021.




 
4.    
Ex parte order SOL-23293-21, issued on August
13, 2021, terminated the tenancy.
 
5.    
The Tenant
paid $300.00 on August 20, 2021 and the rent for September on September 1, 2021.
 
6.    
Ex parte order SOL-23293-21 was enforced on September 8, 2021.
 
7.    
On September 9, 2021, the Tenant filed a motion
to set aside an ex parte order and a
request to review an order.
 
8.    
The Tenant
states that he did not receive ex parte order SOL-23293-21.
 
9.    
I find the fact that
the Tenant made the payments on August 20, 2021 and September 1, 2021 to be
persuasive evidence that the Tenant did not receive the ex parte order. It is
unlikely that the Tenant would have continued trying to preserve his tenancy by
making payments in accordance with order SOL-19410-21 issued on the June 14,
2021 had he already received order SOL-23293-21 terminating his tenancy.
Similarly, under the circumstances noted above (i.e. where the Tenant remedied
the breach immediately the next day and prior to the ex parte application being filed), I expect the Tenant
would have filed a motion to set
aside the ex parte order had he received it.
 
10.  I find the Tenant’s failure to receive the
ex parte order to be a serious error in the proceedings. I find that it would
be an abuse of process to allow order SOL-23293-21 to remain in place under
these circumstances. As a result,
order SOL-23293-21 is cancelled. Given the change in circumstances, order SOL-19410-21 is also cancelled
and replaced by this order.
 
11.  In accordance with my oral direction at the hearing,
the tenancy was reinstated as of December 17,
2021 and the Tenant was put back into possession on that date.
 
12.  The parties disputed whether the Tenant
should be responsible for rent payments between September 8, 2021 when the order was enforced and December 17, 2021
when the tenancy was reinstated.
 
13.  I find that the Tenant is not responsible
for rent payments during this period. Order SOL- 23293-21 was lawfully
enforced, the Tenant evicted, and possession of the rental unit returned to the Landlord
on September 8, 2021.
Although interim order SOL-23293-21-IN
prohibited the Landlord from renting the unit to anyone else and required the
Landlord to preserve the Tenant’s possessions, the Tenant was not in possession
of the rental unit until the tenancy was reinstated on December 17, 2021. I
find that the Tenant is only responsible for rent payments for the period the
Tenant is in actual possession of the rental
unit. In light of this finding,
the parties agreed
that the total arrears and costs owing up to December 31, 2021 would be
$1,842.57.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order SOL-23293-21 issued on August 13, 2021 is cancelled.




 
2.    
Order SOL-19410-21 issued on June 14, 2021 is cancelled.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall pay the Landlord
$1,842.57, representing all arrears and costs owing
up to December 31, 2021.
 
4.    
The Landlord’s application for eviction
of the Tenant is denied
on the condition that:
 
a)

paragraph three of this order:

b)    
The Tenant
shall also pay the Landlord
the rent for the months
of January 2022 to July 2022 in full on the first
business day of each corresponding month.
 
5.    
If the Tenant fails
to make any of the payments in accordance with paragraph
four, and by the dates required,
then:
 
a)    
The Landlord
may, without notice
to the Tenant apply to the Board
pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order
terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant and requiring that the Tenant
pay any new arrears, NSF fees and related charges not accounted for in this
order. The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a breach of a
condition set out in paragraph four of this order.
 
b)    
The outstanding balance
owing under paragraph three of this order shall become payable on the day following the date of default. The monies owing
shall bear interest at the post-judgment interest
rate determined under subsection 207(7) of the Act.
