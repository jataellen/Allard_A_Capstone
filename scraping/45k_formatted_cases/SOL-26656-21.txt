Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26656-21
 
 
In the matter of:      21, 113 EMERALD
STREET S
HAMILTON ON L8N2V4
 
Between:                  D.D. Acquisitions Partnership                                    Landlord
 
 
and
 




Dana Pothier Margaret Robinson


Tenants




 
 
 
D.D. Acquisitions Partnership (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dana Pothier
and Margaret Robinson
(the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants
pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the Board on August 10, 2021 with respect to application
SOL-21610-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.       
I find that the Tenants have not
met the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenants failed to pay the lawful monthly rent in full, on or before November 1, 2021. The Tenants also failed to pay $75.00
towards the arrears, on or before November 1, 2021. These were breaches of the
previous order.
 
3.       
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenants were ordered to pay
$819.70 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application
fee in Order SOL-21610-21. The amount that is still owing from that order
is $660.80 and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous
order SOL-21610-21 is cancelled.
 
5.       
Since the date of the order,
the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from November 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.




 
6.       
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $257.28 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2021 to January 17, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
Order SOL-21610-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move
out of the rental
unit on or before
January 28, 2022 (standard 11 days from the
issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $2,303.73*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 17, 2022 and the costs
related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$30.10 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting January 18, 2022 to the date the Tenants actually move out of the
rental unit or get evicted.
 
5.       
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
28, 2022, the Tenants will
start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 29, 2022.
 
 
January 17, 2022

The tenant has until January 27, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 27, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on July 29, 2022 if the order has not been
filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that
has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
