Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24668-21
 



In the matter
of:


24, 77 PURNELL DRIVE HAMILTON ON L9C4Y4


 




Between:


Cityhousing Hamilton Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Jolan Sztojka Szabolcs Fitos


 
Tenants



 
 
Cityhousing Hamilton Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Szabolcs Fitos and Jolan
Sztojka (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 14, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Sharon Churcher, attended the hearing. As
of 2:41 p.m. the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from March
1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective April 30,
2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $845.00.
4.     The Tenants paid $3,528.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord spoke with
the Tenants on the necessity of a repayment agreement. The Landlord’s attempts
at negotiating a repayment agreement were unsuccessful.
 
6.    
The Landlord
is not holding a last month's rent deposit.
7.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until January 29, 2022 pursuant to subsection
83(1)(b) of the Act. Additional time given to the Tenants to pay the
outstanding amount.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated. The
Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before January 29, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $1,262.22*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 4, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $27.78 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 5, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 29, 2022, the
Tenants will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 30, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 29, 2022, then starting January 30, 2022, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
January 30, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 29, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $2,136.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenants
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or
after January 30, 2022 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant
possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
