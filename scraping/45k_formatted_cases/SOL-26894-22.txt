Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26894-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


110, 60 FIFE ROAD GUELPH ON N1H6Y2


 




Between:


Upbuilding Non
Profit Homes (guelph) Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Tessara Reyes


Tenant



 
 
 
Upbuilding Non Profit Homes
(guelph) Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tessara
Reyes (the 'Tenant')
and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on
January 18, 2022 with respect to application SOL-19351-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following condition
specified in the order: On
January 17, it was observed
that the Tenants
guest’s vehicle was parked
in another Tenants reserved
parking spot. Between January 19-22,
2022, the Tenants guest
parked in another Tenant’s reserved parking spot, resulting
in it being towed.
 
3.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $186.00 for and the
costs related to the Landlord's application
fee in Order SOL-19351-21. The amount that is still owing from that order
is
$186.00 and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous order SOL-
19351-21 is cancelled.
 
4.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenant has
failed to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from January 1, 2022
to January 31, 2022.
 
5.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $442.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 15, 2016 to
February 15, 2022.




File Number: SOL-26894-22
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     Order SOL-19351-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 26, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord -$474.74*. This amount represents the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $25.08
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 16, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
26, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 27, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 26, 2022, then starting
February 27, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 27, 2022.
