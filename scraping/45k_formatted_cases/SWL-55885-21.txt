Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55885-21
 
 



In the matter of:


2, 977 MARENTETTE AVENUE WINDSOR ON N9A2A2


 




Between:


Marda Management Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Don Bell


Tenant



 
 
 
Marda Management Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Don Bell (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 27, 2022. The Landlord's Legal Representative, Kira Passell, and
the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from March 1, 2018 to January 31, 2022.
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective October 15, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $707.47.
 
4.    
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant paid $2,122.35 after the application was filed.
 
6.     The Tenant testified
that they are on a fixed income on ODSP and CPP and old age
security. The Tenant has lived in the
rental unit for 6 years.
 
7.     The Landlord did not want to agree to any payment plan because they indicated that they
have other applications pending at the Board.
 
8.     Based on the limited income
of the Tenant and the long standing
tenancy, I would grant
relief with conditions in order for the Tenant to preserve the tenancy by
paying rent on time and catching up on the arrears.




 
9.    
I have considered
all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find
that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the
conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of
the Act.
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$5,073.76, which represents the arrears of rent
($4,887.76) and costs ($186.00) outstanding for the period ending January 31,
2022.
 
2.     The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant is denied
on the condition that:
 
(a) 
The Tenant shall make the following
payments to the Landlord in respect of the
monies owing under paragraph 1 of this order:
