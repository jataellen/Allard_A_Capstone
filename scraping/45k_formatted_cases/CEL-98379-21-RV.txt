Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-98379-21-RV
 
 



In the matter
of:


MAIN & 2ND FLOOR, 664 KAISER DRIVE MISSISSAUGA ON L5W1T6


 




Between:


Jagroop Mangat Harshdeep Mangat


Landlords




 


and


 




 


Abhinav Sharma


Tenant



 
 
 
Jagroop Mangat and Harshdeep
Mangat (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Abhinav
Sharma (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes (L1). The Landlords also applied for an order terminating the
tenancy and evicting the Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in
the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlords or another tenant. The Landlords
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after
the termination date (L2).
 
This application was resolved
by order CEL-98379-21 issued
on September 7, 2021.
 
On October 7, 2021, the Tenant requested a review of the order.
This request was heard by videoconference on December 8, 2021.
 
The Landlords and the Tenant attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord consented
to the Tenant’s request to review the order on the basis that he was unable to reasonably participate in
the original hearing; therefore, the request is granted.
 
2.     At the hearing,
the Landlords requested the consent of the Board
to withdraw their
L2 application.
 
3.     In accordance with subsection 200(4)
of the Act, I consent
to the withdrawal of the L2
application.
 
4.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
May 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective December
29, 2020.




 
 
 
5.    
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on January
31, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
 
6.     The monthly rent is $2,650.00.
 
7.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $2,650.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
8.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from February 24, 2020
to December 31, 2020.
 
9.     The Tenant testified
that Landlord Jagroop
Mangat agreed to reduce the rent $150.00
per month, from $2,650.00 to $2,500.00, effective May 2020 because of a
water leak. The agreement was verbal. Proof of the agreement is that the
Landlords accepted the
$2,500.00 since
May 2020. Proof of the Tenant’s e-transfers were entered into evidence.
 
10.  The Landlords testified that the they did not agree to lower the rent. They waited to serve
the N4 notice because they got busy, plus they thought the Tenant would catch up; come
December 2020 they realized the Tenant was not going to pay the arrears
therefore they filed at that time.
 
11.  For the reasons
that follow, based on the evidence and testimony before
me, I find there is
insufficient evidence to support the Tenant’s claim that the rent was reduced
to
$2,500.00 from May 2020. The fact
that the Landlords accepted the e-transfers for this amount is not proof they agreed to lower the rent; they have a right to accept that money, and a right to pursue any
difference owing. Further, Landlord Jagroop Mangat testified that she did not
agree to lower the rent and the Tenant was told in April 2020 that it was to
remain at the $2,650.00. Also, the only evidence tendered with respect to a
lower amount being accepted was in regard to the water bill, which is separate
from the rent and not applicable to the issue at hand.
 
12.  This order contains
all the reasons for the decision within
it. No further reasons shall be
issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order CEL-98379-21 dated September 7 2021
is cancelled and replaced by the following:
 
2.     The Landlords L2 application is withdrawn.
 
3.    
The tenancy is terminated as of January
31, 2021 the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlords.
 
4.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $3,650.49*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 31, 2021, less the rent deposit and
applicable interest.




 
 
 
5.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before
February 28, 2022, the Tenant will
start to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
