Review
Order
 
A.C.C. (the 'Landlord') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict M.D. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes and has been persistently late paying
the rent.
 
This application was resolved by order
TEL-89192-18 issued on May 28, 2018.
 
On July 12, 2018, the Tenant requested a
review of the order.
 
The request was heard in Toronto on July
20, 2018. 
 
The Landlord and the
Tenant attended the hearing. The Landlord was represented by S.H.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant’s request for
review alleges the Tenant was not reasonably able to participate in the hearing
of this application held on May 10, 2018. I am satisfied that is true. The
Board’s Notice of Hearing package which includes the application was returned
to the Board by Canada Post. 
2.     
The Tenant says he received
the notices of termination because they were placed through a mail slot in his
door. But mail to his unit goes to a community mail box that he does not use.
He has never been to the Board before and did not know mail would be sent to
him at the address of the rental unit. So he did not get the notice of hearing,
the Board’s order, or the Sheriff’s notice to vacate. Instead, he went home
from work one day to discover the Sheriff had executed an eviction order. 
3.     
Now the Tenant is aware the
Board communicates by mail he should ensure he checks his mail box regularly.
But as the Board’s Notice of Hearing was returned by Canada Post I accept the
Tenant could not reasonably participate in the hearing and the review must be
granted. 
4.     
After announcing the above
decision I instructed the Landlord’s representative to confirm that the
Landlord would put the Tenant back into possession. The unit has not been
re-rented and the Tenant’s things are still inside. She confirmed she spoke
with the Landlord and the superintendent would meet the Tenant and ensure he
had a key to get back into the rental unit. 
5.     
I then proceeded to re-hear
the Landlord’s application. 
6.     
There is no dispute the
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from December 1, 2017 to July 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective March 2, 2018.
7.     
The Tenant paid $2,800.00
after the application was filed.
8.     
The arrears of rent owing
for the period ending July 31, 2018 total $4,710.09. 
9.     
The Tenant has also been
persistently late paying the rent. The tenancy started in February of 2017 and
the Tenant has never paid rent on time. 
10.   The Landlord incurred costs of $190.00 for filing
the application and is entitled to reimbursement of those costs.
11.   The Landlord also incurred costs of $330.00
enforcing the eviction order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff). As
the Tenant had no opportunity to move out voluntarily to avoid this cost being
incurred I am not prepared to order the Tenant to reimburse the Landlord this
cost. 
12.   The Landlord collected a rent deposit of
$1,059.00 from the Tenant and this deposit shall be applied to the last month
of the tenancy pursuant to s. 106(10) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the ‘Act’).
13.   Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenant for the period from January 1, 2018 to March 2, 2018 totalling $3.18.
That amount shall also be offset against the rent arrears owing. 
14.   I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act. 
15.   The Tenant is a plumber. He lives alone but he
has four children and visitation rights so they are in the unit weekly. 
16.   He fell behind in the rent when he did a job and
did not get paid. The Tenant says when he found out about the legal proceedings
he tried to pay the arrears to the Landlord but the Landlord would not accept
partial payment. 
17.   The Tenant initially stated at the hearing that
he has $4,000.00 right now and an additional $2,000.00 coming very soon. But he
then showed me his account balance on his cell phone which only shows he has
$2,300.00 He then stated his girlfriend was willing to provide him with
$2,200.00. 
18.   The Tenant cannot really explain why he was persistently
late paying the rent the entirety of his tenancy. He says he is forgetful
sometimes and he would often find the office closed when he went after hours to
pay by debit.
19.   In March of 2018 the Tenant made a consumer
proposal in bankruptcy. For some unknown reason the Landlord was not identified
as a creditor and was unaware of the bankruptcy proceedings. 
20.   Given all of the above, I find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
Even if the Tenant were able to pay off the rent arrears, his behaviour
indicates it is highly unlikely he will start paying rent on time. The Tenant
seems to have more difficulties with his financial situation than he can
explain and his evidence is simply insufficient to support the assertion that he
can or will pay rent on time in the future. As a result, it would be unfair to
grant relief from eviction and the Board’s standard eviction order shall be
issued. 
21.   This order contains all of the reasons for the
decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.
It is ordered that:
1.     
Order TEL-89192-18 issued on
May 28, 2018 is cancelled and replaced by the following:
2.     
The Landlord shall forthwith
put the Tenant back into possession of the rental unit. 
3.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before August 10, 2018.
4.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $3,633.14, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to July 30, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
5.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $35.44 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
July 31, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
6.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
7.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before August 10, 2018, then starting August 11, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
8.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after August 11, 2018.
