Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-29884-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


# 3, 2189
WESTON ROAD YORK ON M9N1X9


 




Between:


Momen Chowdhury


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Bozik Dzenifer Lazar Robert Tibur


Tenants



 
 
Momen Chowdhury (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Bozik Dzenifer and Lazar Robert
Tibur (the 'Tenants') because they, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the
residential complex have wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the
premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenants to
compensate the Landlord for the damage.
 
The hearing was held by
videoconference on January 6, 2022. A
previous hearing for this application was adjourned
on September 2, 2021 as a result
of the Tenants requiring the services
of a translator. As of 1:39 pm,
neither the Landlord nor the Tenants were present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    Since the Landlord did not appear at the hearing to support
his application, I find that this application has been abandoned.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord's application is dismissed.
