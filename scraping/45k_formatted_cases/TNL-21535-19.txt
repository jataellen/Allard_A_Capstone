Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-21535-19
 











 
 
 

PM (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict VS (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on January 23,
2020.
 
The Landlord’s agent, AG, the
Tenant, and the Tenant’s legal representative, RH, attended the hearing.
 
 
It is determined that:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid
$4,072.20 of the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
September 1, 2019 to January 31, 2020. Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination.
 
2.     
The Tenant also owes the Landlord
$175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     
The total amount owing is
$4,247.20 ($4,072.20 + $175.00).
 
4.     
The Landlord is seeking a
standard termination order. The Landlord’s agent said that the Tenant has
failed to meet the terms of previous payment plans agreed with the Landlord. 
He said that there have been a number of issues with the Tenant, and the
Landlord has attempted to be helpful and accommodating, but it has not improved
the situation.  He also said that the Tenant has only made one payment towards
the rent since October, 2019, and it is prejudicial to the Landlord to continue
the tenancy.
 
5.     
The Tenant proposed a
payment plan of paying $500.00 per month towards the arrears, in addition to
the full rent, on time, going forward.  She said that she receives $2,182.00
per month from ODSP, and that she has no other large regular expenses.
 
6.     
The Tenant said that she has
lived in the residential complex for 27 years, with her son, who is 21 years
old.  She said that she has suffered a number of health issues for the last
five years, including stroke and heart attack, and she has recently spent a
lengthy period in the hospital.
 
7.     
The Tenant said that she
fell behind in the rent because of her stay in hospital in November, 2019.
 
8.     
The Tenant said that it was
seizures and memory loss that contributed to her delinquency in paying the
rent.  She said that she is not aware of her son’s exact financial situation. 
She said that he usually drives a truck, but she believes that he is currently
collecting unemployment insurance.  The Tenant said that she has not demanded
that her son contribute to the rent, but she will work towards ensuring that
her son contributes to the rent, and that he reminds her to pay the rent on
time, going forward.
 
9.     
The Tenant said that, in
addition to her health issues, she has recently had a large bill from CRA for
back taxes, as well as a few major expenses.  The Tenant also said that she
will be applying to various agencies for help with the rent arrears.
 
10.  
The Tenant submits that it
is appropriate and fair to be granted her payment plan because she is not in
good health, and because she has lived in the residential complex for such a
long time.  
 
11.   I find that it is appropriate to give the Tenant
an opportunity to meet her payment plan proposal.  The Tenant has been a
resident of the residential complex for 27 years, and her son grew up there. 
She has testified that she had a medical setback in November, 2019.  She also
said that she will ensure that her son contributes to the rent, and with his
contribution she should have sufficient funds to pay the full rent, going
forward.  Consequently, she should have the opportunity to preserve her
tenancy.
 
12.   I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to  the conditions set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Tenant shall pay the
Landlord $4,247.20 arrears and costs as
follows:                                                      
 
a)   
$500.00 on or before
February 29, 2020,
b)   
$500.00 payments on or
before the 30th of each of the following months: March, April, May,
June, July, August and September, 2020,
c)   
$247.20 on or before October
30, 2020.
 
2.     
The Tenant shall also pay
the Landlord rent owing for the months of February, March, April, May, June,
July, August, September, and October, 2020, no later than the first business
day of each of those months, respectively.
 
3.     
If the Tenant fails to make
any one of the payments in accordance with this order, the outstanding balance
of any arrears of rent and costs to be paid by the Tenant to the Landlord
pursuant to paragraph 1 of this order shall become immediately due and owing
and the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant apply to the Board pursuant
to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenant and requiring that the Tenant pay any new arrears, NSF fees and related
charges that became owing after January 31, 2020.  The Landlord must make the
application no later than 30 days after the Tenant fails to make a payment.
