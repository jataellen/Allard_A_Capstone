Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Numbers: SWL-12547-18 and
SWL-12548-18
DF (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict ADS (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (L1
application SWL-12547-18).
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant has been persistently late
in paying the Tenant's rent (L2 application SWL-12548-18).
 
This application was heard in Waterloo on March 13,
2018.  The Landlord attended the hearing.  As of
10:58 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board. 
 
Determinations:
            L1 application – Arrears of Rent 
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from January 1, 2018
to March 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective January 17, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant is in possession
of the rental unit.
3.     
The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit. 
4.     
As of December 1, 2017, the monthly
rent is $967.10.  However, on the Notice to End a Tenancy Early for Non-payment
of Rent (Form N4), the Landlord claimed the previous rent amount, $950.00, for
the month of January 2018.  As notices cannot be amended, the Landlord was
advised that his options were to seek an eviction order using the arrears set
out in the N4, or to seek an order for payment only and no eviction.  The
Landlord chose to seek the amount of arrears set out in the N4 and L1
application.  Therefore, even though the rent may have increased effective
December 1, 2017, the first month for which the Landlord is seeking the new
rent amount is February 2018. 
5.     
The Tenant paid $450.00
after the application was filed.  The Tenant is also credited with $17.10 that
he paid for rent for January 2018 that was not properly set out in the N4
notice.  The total credited to the Tenant is $467.10.
     L2
application – Persistent Late Rent Payment
6.     
The Tenant has been in the
rental unit for eight years.  At this time, the tenancy is month-to-month and
the rent is due on the first of the month.
7.     
Due to previous issues with
the Tenant paying rent on time, the Landlord obtained an order in 2016
requiring the Tenant to pay his rent on time for one year.  The last month that
was covered by that order was August 2017.  The Tenant paid rent on time for
two months, and then began paying late once again.  In the past seven months,
the rent has been late (or was not received at all) five times.  The rent was
late November 2017 through January 2018, and as of the hearing date, the Tenant
had not paid any rent for the months of February or March 2018.
8.     
I accept the uncontested
testimony of the Landlord and find that the Tenant has persistently failed to
pay the rent on the date it was due.
Two Applications
Filed by the Landlord 
9.     
As the successful applicant,
the Landlord is entitled to seek the application fees for his applications.  In
this case, the Landlord filed two applications on the same day.  Had the
Landlord filed his applications in person, they would have been processed as a
combined application, and the Landlord would have been charged only one filing
fee.  
10.  
Applicants are not allowed
to use the e-file system if they have a combined application.  Despite this
restriction, the Landlord chose to e-file both his applications and he was
charged both filing fees.  I do not think it is fair for the Tenant to pay for
the second application filing fee, as the Landlord made a choice to incur this
fee.  Therefore, I am awarding the Landlord only one of the two application
filing fees.   
Relief from
Eviction
11.  
Having considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), I find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.  
12.  
The Landlord asserted he is
seeking termination of the tenancy.  Given that the Tenant has been in the
rental unit for a long time, and a previous “pay on time” order was successful,
I asked the Landlord why he felt another similar order would not be appropriate
in these circumstances, if the Tenant repaid the outstanding arrears prior to
the termination date.  The Landlord testified that it has been financially and
administratively challenging to deal with the Tenant’s persistent late rent
payments.  In addition, the Tenant has stopped communicating with the
Landlord.  The Landlord has sent emails and text messages to the Tenant, and
has not received any reply.  The Landlord has also dropped by the rental unit
on two occasions with the intent of speaking with the Tenant, but even though
the Tenant’s vehicle was there, the Tenant did not answer his door.  In the
absence of submissions from the Tenant, and considering the negative impact the
Tenant’s actions have had on the Landlord, I am satisfied that it would be
unfair to the Landlord to allow the tenancy to continue.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before March 31, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $1,375.20*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to March 16, 2018.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $31.23 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
March 17, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing one of the applications.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March 31, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from April
1, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 31, 2018, then starting April 1, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 1, 2018.
