Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55348-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


1, 3875
TECUMSEH EAST ROAD
E WINDSOR ON N8W1J1


 




Between:


Marda Management Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


John Patterson


Tenant



 
 
 
Marda Management Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
John Patterson (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 20, 2022.
 
The Landlord, Rouhan Kang, the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Kira Russell, and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from November 1, 2020 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective November 29, 2020.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $767.86.
 
4.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $725.00
from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from June 1, 2020 to
November 29, 2020.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $1,535.72 since the application was filed.
 
7.     The amount outstanding to January 31, 2022, inclusive of rent arrears,
and costs, is
$6,665.76.




 
8.    
At the hearing, the Tenant submitted
that he did not have the income sufficient to pay the monthly rent as well as make payments
towards the outstanding arrears.
 
9.     The Landlord’s Legal Representative offered to waive
$3,000.00 of rent arrears if the Tenant agreed to end the tenancy by February
28, 2022. The Landlord’s Legal Representative also agreed that the last month's
rent deposit would count towards the rent for February
2022 even though the rent is higher than the last month's
rent deposit.
 
10.  Although the Tenant
did not accept the Landlord’s Legal Representative’s offer,
I find that given the current
state of this tenancy, the offer is more than fair. Therefore, I am ordering that the Tenant must move out on
or before February 28, 2022.
 
11.  This order contains
all of the reasons in this matter
and no further reasons will be issued.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 28, 2022.
 
2.     The last month’s
rent deposit of $725.00 will
be applied to the rent for February
2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay the remaining balance of $
3,665.76 to the Landlord, which represents
the remaining amount
of rent owing
and compensation outstanding for the period ending
January 31, 2022.
 
4.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
February 28, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
