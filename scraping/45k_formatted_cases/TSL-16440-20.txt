In the matter
of:


BASEMENT, 3 SCARBOROUGH ROAD TORONTO ON M4E3M4


 




Between:


Shenmin Yang
  Scott Lau


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Gordon
Wills Richard Wills


Tenants



 
 
Shenmin Yang and Scott
Lau (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Gordon Wills and Richard Wills
(the 'Sub Tenants') because the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit
for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on March 16, 2021 at 11:00 a.m.
 
The Landlords, represented by David Rubin, a licensed Paralegal, and the Sub Tenants
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The application is dismissed because
the Landlord did not meet the requirements for this
application under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”).
 
2.    
The Landlord
served the Tenants
an N12 Notice of Termination under section 48 of the Act because the Landlord’s parent
wants to move into the rental unit.
 
3.    
Section 72 (1) of the Act states
 
“The Board shall not make an order terminating a tenancy and evicting
the tenant in an application under section
69 based on, (a)
a notice of termination given
under section 48 on or after the day section 13 of the
Rental Fairness Act, 2017 comes into force, unless the landlord has filed with
the Board an affidavit sworn by the person who personally requires the rental
unit certifying that the person in good faith requires the rental unit for his
or her own personal use for a period of at least one year.”
 
4.    
The Declaration filed with the Board does not certify
that the Landlord’s parent requires the
rental unit for his or her own personal use “for at least one year”.




File Number: TSL-16440-20
 
5.    
Therefore, I find that the Landlord
has not satisfied a
statutory requirement for this
application and the application must therefore be dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlords' application is dismissed.
