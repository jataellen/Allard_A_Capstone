Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55896-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


505, 666 CHIPPAWA STREET WINDSOR ON N9C4B9


 




Between:


Skyline Living


Landlord




 


and


 




 


George Weldon George Weldon Sr


Tenants



 
Skyline Living (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict George Weldon Sr and George Weldon (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 27, 2022. As
of 2:18 p.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board. The Landlord’s Agent, Candise Moore
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period
from October 1, 2020 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective September 3, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful monthly rent is $849.85.
 
4.     The Tenants made no payments
after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $849.85 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from September 1, 2021 to September 3, 2021.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 21, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $6,386.41*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
10, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$27.94 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 11, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
21, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 22, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 21, 2022, then starting February
22, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 22, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 21, 2022,
the Tenants pay the amount of $7,967.15** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants
could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on
time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 22, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.

South West-RO
150 Dufferin Avenue, Suite
