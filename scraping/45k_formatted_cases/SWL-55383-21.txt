Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55383-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


2, 433 WATERLOO STREET LONDON ON N6B2P1


 




Between:


Elleyr Investments Limited Frances Shapiro Realty


Landlords




 


and


 




 


Charles Davis Randy
Counter


Tenants



 
 
Elleyr Investments Limited and Frances
Shapiro Realty (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Charles Davis and Randy Counter (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 27, 2022. As
of 1:56 p.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board. The Landlord’s Agent, Adam Rogers attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlords
served a Notice of Termination effective August 31, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful monthly rent is $1,200.00.
 
4.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,200.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from November 1, 2020 to August 31, 2021.
 
6.    
The Tenants paid $1,600.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the




 
Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 21, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $6,429.35*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 10, 2022,
less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $39.45 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 11,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before
February 21, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 21, 2022, then starting February
22, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 22, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before February 21, 2022, the
Tenants pay the amount of $7,386.00**
to the Landlords or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be
void. This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenants
could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on
time, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 22, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during
the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
