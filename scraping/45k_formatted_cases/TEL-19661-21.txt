Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: TEL-19661-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


UPPER UNIT,
519 HARMONY ROAD S
  OSHAWA ON L1H6V4


 




Between:


Jason Luke


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jermaine Robinson


Tenant



 
 
Jason Luke (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jermaine Robinson (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 5, 2022. Only the Landlord
attended the hearing. As of 2:09 p.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
May 1, 2019 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
21, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,800.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant paid $2,150.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 6, 2022.

2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $18,208.60*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 26, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $59.18 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 27, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
6, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 7, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 6, 2022, then starting
February 7, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 7, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$18,636.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$20,436.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 6, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 7, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
