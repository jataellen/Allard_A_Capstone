Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-21421-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


BASEMENT, 57 ADAMS
DRIVE AJAX ON L1S5W6


 




Between:


Zuhua Luo


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Annette Earls Henry Shane Earls


Tenants



 
 
 
Zuhua Luo (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Annette
Earls Henry and Shane Earls (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants entered
into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
I had previously issued an
endorsement dated February 14, 2022, directing this matter to a hearing, based
on uncertainty over whether both Tenants had signed the agreement to terminate
the tenancy. Based upon a
post-endorsement submission by the Landlord, I am satisfied on the evidence
before me that both Tenants have executed the agreement to terminate the
tenancy, and an order
can issue without
the need for a hearing.
Despite the foregoing, this order is without
prejudice to the Tenants’ statutory right to bring a set-aside motion under s.
77(6) of the Act, should they elect to do so.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord and the Tenants
signed an agreement
to terminate the tenancy as of March 31, 2022.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before March 31, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 31, 2022, then starting
April 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.




File Number: TEL-21421-22
 
3.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after April 1, 2022.
