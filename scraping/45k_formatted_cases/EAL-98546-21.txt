Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-98546-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


903, 10 BLOORVIEW PLACE NORTH YORK ON M2J0B1


 




Between:


Dai Hoe Puah


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Everton Henry


Tenant



 
 
 
Dai Hoe Puah (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Everton Henry (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 15, 2022. The Landlord
and the Tenant attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has
not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay
for the period from November 27, 2020 to February
26, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective October 17, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $2,500.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,000.00 from the
Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from December 2, 2015
to October 17, 2021.
 
S83 Determinations
 
7.    
The Tenant gave oral testimony at the hearing
that he had been in Jamaica since August
2021 for a family member’s funeral and not working which is why he had made no
rent payments.




 
8.    
The Tenant has remained in Jamaica
since that time and has been in contact with the Landlord stating
over several months he will be returning “soon”
and submits he is waiting on an estate settlement in order
to pay the arrears.
 
9.    
The Tenant
submitted at the hearing that he intends to return to Canada sometime in May 2022 and
was asking for an extension
until that time in order to
pay all the arrears.
 
10.  The Tenant has
sons, aged 16 and 18 living at
the rental unit while he is in
Jamaica. The Landlord submitted that
he had no knowledge of the Tenant’s sons living in the unit and was only made aware of their presence sometime
in November 2021 in a discussion with the Tenant.
 
11.  The Landlord submits that he has been patient and
afforded the Tenant ample opportunity to make some arrangement for rent. The Tenant
has been stating he will be returning soon, on several occasions
and still remains in Jamaica.
 
12.  The Landlord submits
that because the Tenant has not made any payment on rent since the application it has caused financial hardship and he has had to borrow
money in order to pay the mortgage and the
property taxes.
 
13.  The Landlord submitted given the high amount of the
rent arrears to date and that the Tenant has made no
payment or attempt at payment since the application was filed,
the Landlord was further
financially burdened, due to the fact that his wife passed away and
he has had to stop working to take care of his special needs child.
 
14.  I find that the landlord has demonstrated his
financial hardship given the quantum of the arrears, and has taken on additional
financial obligations in order to offset the Tenant’s absence of rent payment
and would be prejudicial to the Landlord
to grant the Tenant the time until May 2022 to pay arrears
while paying no rent to the Landlord.
 
15.  I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
16.  The request by the Tenant for an extended order until May 2022 is
denied.
 
 
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 7, 2022.




 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $21,060.54*, which represents
the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
24, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $65.75
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 25, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before March 7, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 8, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 7, 2022, then starting
March 8, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord, on or after March 8, 2022.
 
8.     If
the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$24,701.00 if the payment
is made on or before February 26, 2022, or
ii)             
$27,201.00 if the payment
is made on or before
March 7, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph
and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after March
8, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
