Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-43499-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1107 O'BRIEN STREET NORTH BAY ON P1B5X5


 




Between:


Victoria Bakker


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Laura-lee Bakker


Tenant



 
 
 
Victoria Bakker
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Laura-lee Bakker (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord
requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose
of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 22, 2021.
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.   
The Landlord served the
Tenant with an N12 notice of termination seeking termination of the tenancy for
the purpose of residential occupation by the Landlord.
 
2.   
As a preliminary matter, the Tenant raised
the issue of non-payment by the Landlord to the Tenant of one month’s compensation.
 
3.   
Section 48.1 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the “Act”)
states that, “a
landlord shall compensate a
tenant in an amount equal to one month’s rent or offer the tenant another
rental unit acceptable to the tenant if the landlord
gives the tenant a notice of termination of the tenancy under section 48”. Section 55.1 of the Act
further requires that compensation under section 48.1 be paid to the tenant no
later than on the termination date specified in the notice of termination.
 
4.   
The termination date set out in the N12 notice
is September 30, 2021.
 
5.   
The Landlord testified
that the Tenant is currently in arrears of rent, and thus she did not provide
rent compensation to the Tenant. I
advised the Landlord that I would be prepared to accept a rent credit as
satisfying s. 48.1’s compensation requirement if the rent abatement was for a
period of time prior to the termination date set out in the N12 notice, and if the Landlord
communicated prior to the termination date her intention
to provide a




File Number: NOL-43499-21
 
rent abatement in satisfaction of the one month’s compensation requirement under section
48.1. The Landlord confirmed
that she did not advise
the Tenant of any specific
month that would be rebated in satisfaction of the rent compensation
requirement.
 
6.   
I find the Landlord
has not paid compensation as required by the Act.    The Landlord’s application fails for lack of required compensation.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord's application is dismissed
without prejudice.
