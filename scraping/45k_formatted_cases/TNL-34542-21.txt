In the
  matter of:


BASEMENT, 61 SIR SANFORD FLEMING WAY MAPLE ON L6A0T4


 




Between:


Amapola Salome Ayala
Sotelo


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Juan Carlos Villegas Lecona


Tenant



 
 
 
Amapola Salome
Ayala Sotelo (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Juan Carlos Villegas Lecona (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay
the rent that the Tenant owes and because the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the
residential complex has substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after
the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 988 4914 7021# on January
6, 2022. The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from April 15, 2021 to January 14, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective July 28,
2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,000.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
3.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from August 31, 2019 to July 28, 2021.
 
4.    
The Tenant
has made no rent payments
for ten months.
 
5.    
The Tenant had no evidence to support allegations the Landlord is in serious
beach of the Landlord’s
obligations.
 
6.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.

It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 21, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $7,435.11*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
10, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$32.88 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 11, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.

the full amount owing* on or before

will start to owe interest. This will

balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 21, 2022, then starting January
22, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.

Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 22, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)          
$9,201.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 14, 2022, or
ii)         
$10,201.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 21, 2022**.
If the Tenant
does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after January
22, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
