Order under Section

Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-02754-21-SA



In the matter
of:


43 JULES AVENUE VAUGHAN ON L4Y1Y2


 




Between:


Vincenzo Gagliardi


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jeff Rivett


Tenant



 
 
Vincenzo Gagliardi (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Jeff Rivett (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant entered into an agreement to terminate the tenancy. That application was
resolved by order CEl-02754-21 issued on September 24, 2021.
 
The Tenant
filed a motion
to set aside order CEL-02754-21.
 
This motion was heard by video conference on December 21, 2021.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s employee
C. Lucas, and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
The Tenant spoke to Tenant Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord
filed an L3 application for eviction based
on a letter allegedly signed
by the Tenant on July 21, 2021,
that said the Tenant would vacate the rental unit on August 31, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant did not
understand why he had been issued an eviction order because he said he had no knowledge of the letter
dated July 21, 2021, that read “I, the Tenant,
Jeff Rivet, agree to vacate the premises known as 43 Jules Ave, Vaughan
ON, on or before August 31, 2021. Furthermore, I will leave the premise in
broom swept condition and remove all garbage and debris inside and outside of
the property.” The letter was
typewritten, except for the Tenant’s surname “Rivet”, and
it was signed by the
Landlord, and purportedly initialed by the Tenant, written as “JR”.
 
3.    
The Tenant said that in
June, he paid four months rent in advance for July through October, 2021. He said that he was unaware
of any letter signed by both him and the Landlord.
 
4.    
The Tenant said that he
would like to remain in the rental unit. He
said that he has a roommate, and a 13
year old daughter that live with him. He said that it is difficult
to find an alternative two
bedroom accommodation that is within his budget.

5.    
The Landlord’s
employee, C. Lucas (CL), said that it was not the Landlord, but a real estate
agent, V. Montesanto (VM), who brought the agreement to the Tenant to sign. She said that she had no knowledge
of the circumstances of why or when the agreement was brought to the Tenant. She said that VM asked him to sign the
agreement because he believed there was a verbal agreement for the Tenant to
leave. CL said that VM has been
collecting the rent on behalf of the Landlord.
VM was not at the hearing to testify.
 
6.    
CL said that the Tenant has promised to leave the rental unit for some time, and the
Landlord never had anything in writing.
 
7.    
I found the Tenant’s
evidence credible, i.e. that he had no knowledge of an agreement to terminate
the tenancy. The alleged signature on
the agreement to terminate was not a signature, rather it had the Tenant’s
initials. It did not at all match the
Tenant’s signature on his set aside motion
submitted to the Board. The Landlord did not bring
the document to the Tenant
personally. The Landlord’s employee,
CL, said that a third party, VM, who was not at the hearing, had brought the
document to the Tenant to sign. CL
was very vague and evasive about the circumstances of why or when VM, who
collected rent on behalf of the Landlord, had brought this agreement to the
Tenant to sign. CL was also very
anxious about how the Landlord is going to be able to evict the Tenant because
he refuses to leave. The Landlord’s
Declaration, attached to the L3 application, stated that the Tenant “submitted
a letter stating his intentions of vacating.”
The Landlord’s own evidence at the hearing was that the letter had been brought
to the Tenant to sign by VM, and it was therefore not submitted to
the Landlord by the Tenant.
 
8.    
Based on the above evidence and testimony, I am not satisfied that there was ever an agreement to terminate concluded
between the parties.
 
9.    
Consequently, I grant the Tenant’s set aside motion.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order CEL-02754-21 is set aside;
and
 
2.    
The Landlord's application is dismissed.
