File Number: SOL-26608-21
 
 
 
Landlord
 
 
 
Tenant




 
On November
19, 2021, Jennifer Van Houten (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict Victor Osai (the 'Tenant') and for an order to
have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on October
26, 2021 with respect to application
SOL-23037-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The
order provided that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of
the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without
notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if
the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following condition
specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed
to pay to the Landlord
$181.00 on or before November
15, 2021 towards arrears of
rent.
 
3.    
The previous application included a request for an order for the payment
of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction,
the Landlord is entitled
to request an order for
the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $1,086.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the
Landlord's application fee in Order
SOL-23037-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $1,086.00 and that amount is included
in this order.
As a result, the previous order SOL-23037-21 is cancelled.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order
SOL-23037-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy
between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 21, 2022.

3.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$1,086.00*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to November 30, 2021 and the costs related to the application fee for the previous application.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $14.79 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting December 1, 2021 to
the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
January 21, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January
22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 21, 2022,
then starting January 22, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after
January 22, 2022.
 
8.     
The tenant has until January 20, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the
order under s. 78(9) of
the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 20, 2022 the order will be stayed, and the Board will schedule a hearing.
 
9.    
In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part
of this order relating to the eviction
expires on July 22, 2022 if the
order has not been filed on or before this date with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
