Order under Section

Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-16751-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


203, 20 EMERALD STREET
NORTH HAMILTON ON L8L8A4


 




Between:


Dms (formerly Fengate) Unknown


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Donald Echlin Jason
Sheldon


Tenants



 
 
 
Dms (formerly Fengate) Unknown
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Donald Echlin
and Jason Sheldon
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the
rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 12, 2021. The Landlord's Legal Representative, Frank Calgani , the
Tenant Jason Sheldon and the Tenant's Legal Representative Joseph Kazubk
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required
to pay for the period from April 1, 2020 to October 31,
2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 24, 2020.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $998.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is holding a last month’s
rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant paid $1,792.00 after the application was filed.
 
 
Tenant's Legal Representative’s Submissions
 
6.     The Tenant's Legal Representative gave oral
testimony that the N4 was
flawed due to incorrect amount
indicated as the Tenant had not
been informed that the Tenant’s RGI had been removed.




 
7.    
The Tenant's
Legal Representative gave oral testimony that the N4 was flawed,
due to the fact that the N4
listed 2 Tenants, and one of the Tenants was deceased.
8.    
The Tenant
gave oral testimony
that the Landlord
made 3 attempts to move
the Tenant to a smaller, more affordable unit, and
the Tenant turned down the units offered by the Landlord.
 
Landlord's Legal Representative’s Submissoins
 
9.    
Landlord's Legal Representative
gave oral testimony that he consented to a previous adjournment, in order to give the
Tenant time to resolve his RGI application.
10. 
The Landlord's
Legal Representative gave submission that the Tenant’s RGI had been reviewed and turned down for the third time,
and as such the Tenant
was obligated to pay the full market rent for the rental
unit, since the Tenant was not eligible for RGI.
11. 
The Landlord's
Legal Representative gave oral testimony that the Landlord made reasonable attempts
to move the Tenant to a smaller
more affordable unit, however
the Tenant was not satisfied with the units that were offered.
 
 
Findings and
Analysis
 
12. 
I find the N4 submitted by the
Landlord’s Legal Representative is valid. RGI is not a matter for the board to consider and I
find the lawful monthly rent identified in the application for the arrears is
correct.
 
13. 
I find that the
N4 submitted by the Landlord’s Legal Representative is valid with both Tenant’s named on the N4. The Landlord had served the N4 prior to finding
out that one of the Tenant’s
was deceased. The name of the deceased Tenant on the application does not make it invalid and the tenancy
is considered a joint tenancy, therefore making the remaining Tenant responsible for the lawful monthly
rent.
 
14. 
I have considered
the oral testimony of the Tenant and the Landlord’s Legal Representative about the offer to move the Tenant to a smaller, 1 bedroom
unit, and I find the Landlord made appropriate attempts to move the Tenant
to a smaller unit.
 
15. 
I find that the application filed by the Landlord
accurately reflects the arrears owed by the Tenant
and all the paperwork satisfies the requirements of the Board.
16. 
have considered
all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
 
 
 
 
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 8, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$19,574.28*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 28, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $32.81 per day for compensation for the use of the
unit starting January 29, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing*
on or before February 8, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 9,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or
before February 8, 2022, then starting February
9, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 9, 2022.
 
8.     If
the Tenants wish to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$19,825.00 if the payment
is made on or before January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$20,823.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 8, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not
make full payment in
accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act
to set aside this order if they pay
the amount required under that subsection on or after February 9, 2022 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
