and


 




 


Diana Palma Natasha

Tenants



 
 
Hazelview Property
Services Inc (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Diana Palma and Natasha Alfeche
(the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe. The Landlord
also claimed NSF cheque charges
and related administration charges.
 
This
application was heard by videoconference on January 13, 2022. The Landlord’s
Legal Representative, John Edlund, and one of the Tenants, Natasha
Alfeche, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay
for the period from March 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective August 30, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord
incurred charges of $5.00 for a
cheque tendered by or on behalf of the
Tenants, which was returned NSF and $20.00 for related administration charges.
 
3.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
4.     The monthly rent is $1,360.00.
 
5.    
The Tenant
paid all arrears
for the period ending
January 31, 2022 after the application
was filed.
 
6.    
The only amount outstanding is part of the Landlord's cost of filing
the application. As a
result, the order will be limited to costs only and not eviction.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$136.00 for the remaining cost of filing the application.




File Number: SWL-55403-21
 
2.    
If the Tenants do not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March 31, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from April 1, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
