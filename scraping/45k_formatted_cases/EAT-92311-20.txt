In the matter
of:


2, 466 CATHERINE STREET HAWKESBURY ON K6A1Z9


 




Between:


Marc-Olivier Parisien


Tenant




 


 
and


 




 


Dilara Ferdous


Landlord



 
 
 
Marc-olivier Parisien (the
'Tenant') applied for an order determining that Dilara Ferdous (the 'Landlord') failed
to meet the Landlord's maintenance obligations under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') or failed to comply with
health, safety, housing or maintenance standards (the ‘T6’ application).
 
The Tenant also applied
for an order determining the Landlord
interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenant or by a
member of their household (the ‘T2’ application).
 
These applications were heard together by videoconference on January 12, 2022.
 
The Tenant and the Landlord attended
the hearing. The Landlord
was represented by his
paralegal Daniel Moak.
 
 
Determinations:
 
The T6 Application
 
1.    
The Tenant’s T6 alleges several
maintenance and safety concerns with the rental unit. For the following reasons,
I find that the Landlord
failed to meet the Landlord's obligations under subsection 20(1) of the Act.
 
2.     On August 25, 2020 an inspection of the rental unit
took place by municipal officials. Following
the inspection, the Landlord received
an Order to Comply pursuant
to s. 12(2) of the Building
Code Act 1992. The order was
dated September 14, 2020 and alleged the following contraventions:
 
•        
The apartment had no ventilation




 
•        
The gap under the fire door is more than 6 mm
and the door closer is missing
•        
The handrail is missing
from the entrance stair
•        
A
cooking stove fan is not installed
•        
An inspection was required
to witness 2 5/8 type X drywall
on the ceiling
•        
The membrane was not installed on the leaking
foundation wall
•        
A
door viewer was required for the entrance
wall
 
3.     After receiving the Order to Comply, the Landlord offered
to pay the Tenant $850.00
and provide him with a new rental unit located approximately 10 minutes
away. The Tenant accepted the $850.00 and was expected move out for October 31,
2020.
 
4.     The Tenant subsequently changed his mind and remained
in the unit. The Landlord applied the $850.00.00 to rent for month of November 2020. The Landlord
discounted the rent for
December 2020 and January 2021 by $100.00.
 
5.     The Landlord served the Tenant with an N13 notice
of termination, November
10, 2020. As a result of the
notice of termination the Tenant moved out April 02, 2021.
 
6.     The Landlord gave the Tenant
a rent credit for February
2021 for compensation as required by s. 49.1 of the Act
 
7.     The Tenant’s last month rent deposit was applied to the rent for the month of March 2021.
 
8.     According to the Board’s Interpretation Guideline 5,
if a work order is issued in relation to the residential unit and the Tenant
files the order with the Board, a Member is entitled to accept this as evidence
of non-compliance with a standard, subject to the landlord’s right to dispute
the order before the Board and have the Board decide the issue. I see no reason
to depart from the guideline in these circumstances. The Landlord did not
seriously dispute the work order, and thus I find the Landlord failed to comply
with housing and maintenance standards outlined in s. 20(1) of the Act, as outlined in the work order.
 
Remedy
 
9.    
In Onyskiw v. CJM Property
Management Ltd., 2016 ONCA 477 (CanLII) the Court of Appeal rejected
the idea that any service
interruption or maintenance issue
amounts to an automatic
breach of the Act. Instead,
the Court held that the Board must make a “contextual analysis” in each case,
looking at all the facts
before finding that a
landlord breached the Act. As
part of this analysis, the Court directed the Board to look at the essential
nature of a tenant’s complaints and what steps, if any, were taken by the landlord.
 
10.  Subsection 30(2) of the Act states: “In determining
the remedy under this section, the Board shall consider whether the tenant or
former tenant advised the landlord of the alleged breaches before applying to
the Board.” This section of the Act was intended to reflect the case law in the area that basically states that if a landlord
does not know about




 
a particular disrepair problem
then the landlord
cannot and should
not be held financially
liable for failing to address it.
 
11.  Additionally, in accordance with section 16 of the Act,
when a landlord becomes liable to pay any amount as a result
of a
breach of subsection 20(1), the tenant has a duty to take
reasonable steps to minimize the loss.
 
12.  On August 12, 2020 the Tenant sent the Landlord a text
message with a list of maintenance issues. The Landlord acknowledged receiving
this request. Although the extent of the issues was not confirmed until the
Order to Comply was issued, I find the Landlord was aware of problems with the rental
unit beginning August 12, 2020. As
noted above, the Landlord offered the Tenant a new rental unit as well
as $1050.0.
 
13.  The Tenant seeks a 100% rent abatement for the entire
time he lived in the rental unit. The Landlord submits if an abatement is
awarded it should be no more than 25%. It further submits that any abatement ought
to be offset by the $1050.00 that the Landlord provided the Tenant after the
compliance order was issued.
 
14.  An abatement is a contractual remedy. It reflects the
idea that rent is for a bundle of goods and services
and if a tenant is not
receiving everything he or she bargained for, they
are entitled to an abatement proportional to the difference. Assessing quantum is something
of an art and will vary based on several factors including the nature of the
problem, the length of time or frequency of the breach, and the impact on the
Tenant.
 
15.  I have considered the fact that Tenant was forced
to live in a rental
unit with
multiple maintenance issues. While
most of the issues may have had little impact
on the Tenant’s ability to
normally reside or enjoy the rental unit, the Tenant was nonetheless entitled
to live in a unit that meets the Act’s maintenance standards. Considering the totality
of the circumstances, including the nature of the issues and the Landlord’s
response, in my view a 20% abatement in rent would be appropriate. However, I
agree with the Landlord that the amount of the abatement ought to be offset by
the amounts already paid to the Tenant.
 
16.  Accordingly, I
find the Tenant is entitled
to a 20% for the period of August 12,
2020 until March 31, 2021. The Tenant did not pay rent for the two days he lived in the unit in April
2021. The Tenant is not entitled to a rent abatement for this period.
 
17.  In their T6 application the Tenant claims $350.00 for
additional hydro costs and also seeks compensation for breathing problems that
resulted from mould in the rental unit. The Tenant further claims the impact of
these issues on his life have caused to him develop anxiety issues. Consequently, the Tenant has needed therapy.
However, at the hearing the Tenant did not lead
any evidence to support any of these claims, and
thus I decline to award a remedy.
 
18.  The Tenant also sought an order requiring the Landlord
to comply with the order under the Building Code Act 1992, and an order
terminating the tenancy. Since the Tenant has already moved out of the unit, it is not necessary
to consider these requests and I decline to make the
requested orders.




 
 
 
 
The T2 application
 
19.  The T2 application alleges a number
of illegal entries
by the Landlord. At the hearing the Tenant did not lead any evidence to
expand on these allegations. Accordingly, the T2 application is dismissed.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     Application EAT-92311-20 is dismissed.
 
2.     Respecting EAT-92312-20, the Landlord shall pay to the Tenant a rent abatement of
$1297.67 This represents a 20% rent abatement for the period
of August 12, 2020 until
March 31, 2021.
 
3.     $1050.00 shall be deducted from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenant.
As a result, the Landlord
owes the Tenant $247.67
 
4.     The Landlord shall also pay the Tenant $48.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     The total amount the Landlord
owes the Tenant
is $295.67.
 
6.     The Landlord shall pay the Tenant the full amount
owing by February 28, 2022. If the Landlord does not pay the Tenant the full
amount owing by February 28, 2022 the Landlord
will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 1,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the
outstanding balance.
 
7.     The Tenant has the right to enforce
this order anytime
beginning March 01, 2022.
