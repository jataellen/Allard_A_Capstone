Between:


Durdana Sohail

Tenants




 


 
and


 




 


Karamjit
Dhaliwal


Landlord



 
 
Durdana Sohail
and Syed Ahmed (the 'Tenants') applied for an order determining that Karamjit
Dhaliwal (the 'Landlord') has collected or retained money illegally.
 
This application
was heard by way of video conference on October 28, 2021. The Tenants attended the hearing. As of 10:36am
the Landlord was not present
despite being served
with notice of hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
The Tenant’s
T1 application was filed on June 11, 2020 and alleges that the Landlord charged an illegal rent and that
the Tenants paid an illegal charge to the Landlord.
 
Tenant’s uncontested evidence:
 
Illegal rent:
 
2.   
The Tenant’s
testified that they moved into the rental unit on April 1, 2018 and vacated on March 21, 2020.
 
3.   
The Tenant’s
submitted into evidence
a copy of the lease agreement signed
by the parties on February 4, 2018 (TT exhibit #1). The lease agreement states that the
monthly rent is
$1,900.00 per month. The lease agreement
further goes on to state
that the Tenants
shall pay an extra $100.00 per month for any additional guests or
occupants residing in the rental unit.
 
4.   
During the months of September and October 2019, the Tenant Durdana had her parents visiting from Pakistan and temporarily residing
in the rental unit. The Landlord demanded that the Tenant’s pay an
additional $200.00 for each month as there were two temporary occupants
residing in the unit. The Tenant’s
paid the additional $400.00 to the Landlord for these months.




 
 
 
Illegal charges:
 
5.   
The Tenant’s
testified that as per their
lease agreement, the Tenants were required to pay
70% of all utility charges to the Landlord. Upon
review of the utility bills and discussion with the Landlord, the Tenant’s
discovered that they had in fact been paying to the Landlord 75% of the utility
charges.
 
6.   
The Tenants
submitted into evidence
a spreadsheet created
by the Tenant’s outlining the charges and additional payments for
the utilities. (TT exhibit #2). The
spreadsheet consists of all utility charges from April 2018 to September 2019. The total amount the
Tenant’s allege
was overcharged for this period
was $414.46.
 
7.   
The Tenant’s
were unable to provide any evidence of being overcharged for the period
of October 2019 to March 2020 as the Landlord did not provide the
Tenant’s with a copy of the utility bills to review.
 
8.   
The Tenant’s
testified that the Landlord agreed
via email in March
2020 that he would refund the
Tenant all overcharged utility payments upon vacating the rental unit. The
Tenant’s did not provide a copy of this email in their evidence.
 
9.   
As of the date of the hearing, the Landlord had not refunded
the Tenant’s the overcharged
utility payments and has further ignored the Tenant’s phone callas and follow
emails.
 
 
Analysis:
 
10.
Sections 116, 120(1) and 135 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the Act) state
in part
 
116. (1) A landlord shall not increase
the rent charged to a tenant for a rental unit without first giving the tenant at least 90 days written
notice of the landlord’s
intention to do so.
 
(2)  
Subsection (1) applies even if the rent charged
is increased in accordance with an order under section 126.
 
(3)  
The notice shall be in a form approved
by the Board and shall set out the
landlord’s intention to increase the rent and the amount of the new rent.
 
 
120 (1) No landlord
may increase the rent charged
to a tenant, or to an assignee
under section 95, during the term of their tenancy by more than the
guideline, except in accordance with section 126 or 127 or an agreement under
section 121 or 123.




 
135. (1) A tenant or former tenant of a
rental unit may apply to the Board for an order that the landlord,
superintendent or agent of the landlord pay to the tenant any money the person collected or retained in contravention of this Act or the Tenant Protection Act, 1997.
 
(4)  
No order
shall be made under this section with respect to an application filed more than one year after the person collected or retained
money in contravention of this Act or the Tenant Protection Act, 1997.
 
11. Based on the evidence before the Board, I
am satisfied that the Landlord charged the Tenant’s illegal rent during
the months of September and October 2019. The Landlord
increased the rent without
complying with any of the requirements set out in section 116 of
Act. The increase amount of $200.00
per month is also well in excess of the 1.8% guideline increase which was
permitted for the year 2019.
 
12. Although I find that the Tenant’s signed a
lease agreement agreeing to the $100.00 increase per additional occupant
or guest, the Landlord and the
Tenant cannot contract outside the provisions
of the Act. This is explicitly stated in sections 3 and 4
of the Act:
 
3 
(1) This Act, except Part V.1, applies with
respect to rental units in residential complexes, despite any other
Act and despite any agreement
or waiver to the
contrary.
 
 
4  (1) Subject to subsection 12.1 (11) and section 194, a provision
in a tenancy agreement that is inconsistent with this Act or the
regulations is void.
 
13.
As
such, I find that the Tenants are
entitled to a rebate in the amount of $400.00.
This amount includes $200.00
in illegal rent for the months of September and October 2019.
 
14.
Based
on the evidence before the Board, I am satisfied that the Tenant’s have
overpaid the utility charges
to the Landlord and were not reimbursed. The Tenant’s testimony
was consistent throughout the proceedings and the Landlord
was not present
to challenge the testimony of the Tenants.
 
15.
The Tenant
is requesting a rebate of $414.46 which
is the overpayments for the period of April 2018 to September 2019.
 
16.
Section
135(4) explicitly states that the Tenant must file their application to the
Board within one-year of paying the illegal
charge to the Landlord.
The Tenant’s application was filed on June 11, 2020. Pursuant to Ontario Regulation 73/20 –
Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act, limitation periods
were stayed from March 16, 2020 to September 14, 2020.




 
17.
The
issue of when the one year limitation period starts to run and the meaning of
the phrase “collected or retained” has been considered in at least two
decisions of the Divisional Court: Dollimore v. Azuria Group
Inc., [2001] O.J. No. 4408; and Pasternak v. 3011650 Nova Scotia Limited, 2014 ONSC
1012.
 
18.
Dollimore
is a
decision with respect to the Tenant Protection Act, 1997 but the wording
of the relevant limitation period is identical to the current Act. In Dollimore
the landlord collected 12 months of rent in advance of when it was due, and
the tenants filed their application more than one year after the payment was
made. The Court determined that
moneys that have been collected improperly were still seen to have been
retained improperly and therefore since the funds
remain retained by the Landlord,
these funds are seen to be within the one year
limitation and were therefore awarded.
 
19.
Pasternak
is a
decision where the landlord was collecting an illegal rent amount each month. In Pasternak the Court found that
the landlord collecting an illegal charge on an ongoing monthly basis to not be same as “retaining” an illegal charge
or amount as set out in Dollimore, but rather
collecting an illegal charge. In Pasternak,
the Court determined that the one-year limitation period commences the date the
landlord collects the illegal charge or amount.
 
20.
In my
view, I find that the facts in this case relate to Pasternak. This is not a situation where the Landlord
has collected an illegal deposit or charge that was intended to be retained and applied
to an obligation that comes due in the future.
Rather, the Landlord was collecting an excess amount
of funds to be applied to the Tenant’s portion of utility payments.
 
21.
As such, I find that the Landlord had collected and not retained
an illegal charge
from the Tenants. The Board
only has the jurisdiction to order a remedy for the Tenant starting from March
16, 2019.
 
22.
The Tenant’s
shall be awarded
a rebate of $221.23 which
consists of the overpaid utility charges for the period of March
16, 2019 to September 30, 2019.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord
shall pay to the Tenants
the sum of $621.23. This amount represents
$221.23 collected in illegal charges
and $400.00 in excess rent.
 
2.    
The Landlord
shall also pay to the Tenants $50.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
The total
amount the Landlord
owes to the Tenants is $671.23




 
4.    
If the Landlord does
not pay the Tenants the full amount owing by January 21, 2022, the Landlord will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January
22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the outstanding
balance.
 
5.    
The Tenants
have the right, at any time, to collect the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
