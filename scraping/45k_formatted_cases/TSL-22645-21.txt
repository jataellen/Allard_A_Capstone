Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-22645-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


517, 806 LANSDOWNE AVENUE TORONTO ON M6H4K2


 




Between:


Ridgevest Delelopments Limited


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Geza Buri Klaudia Maka


Tenants



 
 
 
Ridgevest Delelopments Limited (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Klaudia Maka and Geza Buri (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard via videoconference September
22, 2021 at 1:00 p.m.
 
The Landlord, represented by Bryan Rubin, a licensed Paralegal, and the Tenants
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from June 1, 2021 to September
30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective June 19, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
were in possession of the rental
unit when the application
was filed.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is
$1,800.00
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,800.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from March 1, 2021 to
June 19, 2021.
 
6.    
The Tenants
paid $300.00 after
the application was filed.
 
7.    
As of the hearing
date, the Tenant owed the Landlord, $7.086.00
including arrears of rent
to September 30, 2021 of $6,900.00 and the application fee of $186.00. Since
the




 
hearing, another
three rental periods have begun, and three more month’s rent have become due.
Therefore, the amount in this order includes October 2021, November 2021,
December 2021, and January 2022’s rent. If the Tenant has paid the Landlord
October 2021, November 2021, December
2021 and January
2022’s rent, and /or made any payments to the Landlord since
the hearing, the Landlord shall deduct those payments from the amount owing
in this order.
 
8.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until October 10, 2021 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. The
Tenants have requested the additional 18 days in order to allow receipt of funds that will enable them to pay all outstanding arrears. The
Landlord’s Representative sought a Standard Order. At the hearing, the
Landlord’s Legal Representative was amenable to extending the eviction date to October
10, 2021. As this order is being
issued on January 12, 2021, this extension has
effectively already been granted.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 23, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$11,274.10*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 12, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $59.18
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 13, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
23, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 24,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 23, 2022, then starting January
24, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 24, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 23, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $14,286.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.




 
9.    
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after January
24, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
