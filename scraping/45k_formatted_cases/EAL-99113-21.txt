In the matter
of:


1003, 120 AUGUSTUS STREET CORNWALL ON K6J3W1


 




Between:


Cornwall & Area
Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Ronald
Carriere


Tenant



 
 
 
Cornwall &
Area Housing Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Ronald Carriere (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant failed to
meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board
on November 23, 2021 with respect to application EAL- 90427-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant
has not met the following condition specified in the order: the Tenant agreed
that arrangements would be made to rehome their dog no later then December 1, 2021. An inspection of the unit on December
14, 2021, found that the dog
was still present in the unit.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 25, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 25, 2022, then starting
January 26, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.

3.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 26, 2022.

The tenant has until January 24, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 24, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on July 26, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date
