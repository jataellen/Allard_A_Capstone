Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44519-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


168 SYLVAN CRESCENT
  NORTH BAY ON P1A2Y8


 




Between:


Turret Management Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Boyladd Chum Shania
Koostachin


Tenants



 
 
 
Turret Management Inc (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Shania Koostachin and Boyladd Chum (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on February 3, 2022.
Only the Landlord’s Agent,
Martha Maciuk, attended the hearing. As of 1:30 p.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the
total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from November 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective November 23, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent for
the unit is $1,072.90.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,060.18 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from September 1, 2020 to November 23, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenants paid $3,465.24 after
the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until February 22, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.




 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before February 22, 2022.
 
2.    
As of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the Landlord is entitled to by $906.55*.
 
3.     However, the Landlord
is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenants: $35.27 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 12, 2022 to the date the Tenants
move out of the
unit, and $186.00 for the cost
of filing the application.
 
4.    
The Landlord
or the Tenants shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February
22, 2022, then starting February
23, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 23, 2022.
 
7.     If, on or before February 22, 2022, the Tenants pay the
amount of $986.92** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
8.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 23, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
