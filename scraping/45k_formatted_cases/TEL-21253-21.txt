Rajwinder Singh
Dhaliwal (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Camille Lewis and Glen Albert Simon (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on July 9, 2021 with
respect to application HOL-09199-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could
apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenants
have not met the following condition specified in the order: the Tenant did not pay the lawful rent for December on or before December 1, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 28, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January
28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
