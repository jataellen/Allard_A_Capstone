Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-21362-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


308, 50 ADELAIDE AVENUE E OSHAWA ON
  L1G1Y9


 




Between:


CAMSTA (no
1) LP


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Douglas West


Tenant



 
 
 
CAMSTA (no 1) LP (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Douglas West (the 'Tenant')
and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes
because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by
the Board on December 15, 2021 with respect to application TEL-19132-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenant
failed to pay the lawful
monthly rent in full, on or before
January 1, 2022. The
Tenant failed to pay $526.00 towards the arrears, on or before January 15,
2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $6,322.62 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order TEL-19132-21. The amount that is still owing from that
order is $6,322.62 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order TEL-19132-21 is cancelled.

5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed
to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order TEL-19132-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 12, 2022.
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$7,549.02*. This amount represents the rent owing up to February 1, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$40.32 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 2, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before
February 12, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
February 13, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 12, 2022, then starting
February 13, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 13, 2022.

The tenant has until February 11, 2022 to file
a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by February 11, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of

Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
