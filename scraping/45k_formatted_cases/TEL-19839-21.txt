Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19839-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


914, 75 SILVER
SPRINGS BOULEVARD TORONTO
  ON M1V1W2


 




Between:


IMH POOL XV LP


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Nicola Geer


Tenant



 
 
IMH POOL XV LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Nicola Geer (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 19, 2022. The
Landlord's Legal Representative, Sara Mathew,
and the Tenant attended the hearing. The Tenant declined
the opportunity to speak with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
29, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $2,164.33.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,190.64 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit has been paid to the Tenant for the period
from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 20202.
 
6.    
The Tenant paid $6,155.00
after the application was filed.
 
7.    
I have considered
all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would not be
unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection
83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.




 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$4,852.65, which represents the arrears of rent
($4,666.65) and costs ($186.00) outstanding for the period ending January 31,
2022.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant
is denied on the condition
that:

(b) 
The Tenant shall also pay the Landlord the rent for the months of
February 2022 up to and including December
2022 in full,
on or before the first day
of each corresponding month.
 
3.     If the Tenant fails to make any of the payments in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates required, then:
 
(a)  
The Landlord may apply under section
78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
(the ‘Act’) for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, and for




 
the payment
of any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not already ordered under paragraph
1 of this order. The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a
breach of a condition set out in paragraph 2 of this order.
 
(b)
