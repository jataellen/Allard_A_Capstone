Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-21435-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


14, 3785
LAWRENCE AVENUE E TORONTO ON M1G1R2


 




Between:


1385002 Ontario Ltd


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Nevia Davis


Tenant



 
 
 
1385002 Ontario Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Nevia Davis (the 'Tenant') and for an
order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on January 26,
2022 with respect to application TEL-19711-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy
and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $400.00 arrears
in full on or before February
1, 2022. The Tenant
did not pay $1504.89 rent on or before February 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of
the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in
addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $3,215.23 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order TEL-19711-21. The amount that is still owing from that
order is $1,315.12 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order TEL-19711-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,504.89 from the
Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.




File Number: TEL-21435-22
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from November 1, 2020
to February 28, 2022.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     Order TEL-19711-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before March 11, 2022.
 
3.     As of the date of this order, the Tenant owes no money
to the Landlord because the amount of the rent deposit
and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit exceeds the
arrears of rent, that the Landlord is entitled to under this order by $191.27.
 
4.    
The Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenant: $49.48
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting
March 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit;
 
5.     The Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 11, 2022, then starting
March 12, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 12, 2022.
