Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-36474-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


UPPER UNIT, 511 MALVERN CRESCENT NEWMARKET ON L3Y7L7


 




Between:


Soghra Kouchaki-Ramezan Seyed Reza Mazloom Farzaghy


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Melanie McDonald
  Shawn Swales


Tenants



 
 
 
On December 31, 2021, Soghra Kouchaki-Ramezan and Seyed Reza
Mazloom Farzaghy (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Melanie
McDonald and Shawn Swales (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants entered into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlords and the Tenants
signed an agreement to terminate the tenancy as of April 30, 2022.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault basis,
before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenants to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before April 30, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated on or before
April 30, 2022, then starting May 1, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.




File Number: TNL-36474-22
 
 
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after May 1, 2022.

the order will be stayed and the
Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction

the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
