Order under Sections 68
and 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-16668-18
 
GP
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict AP
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (L1
application).
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant.  The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the
termination date (L2 application).
 
This application was heard in [CITY] on July 4, 2018. 
The Landlord’s Agent, NC, attended the hearing.  As of 11:39 a.m., the Tenant
was not present or represented at the hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.  
 
The Landlord called one witness, WM.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 application – Arrears of Rent
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from April 1, 2018 to
July 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective April 28, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant is in possession
of the rental unit. 
3.     
The monthly rent is $1,150.00.
4.     
The Tenant has made no
payments since the application was filed. 
5.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,150.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from October 1, 2017 to April 28, 2018.
7.     
Section 59 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (‘the Act’) sets out that a landlord may give a tenant
notice of termination of their tenancy if the tenant fails to pay rent lawfully
owing under a tenancy agreement (N4 notice).  In this case, because the Tenant
was in arrears of rent, the Landlord served an N4 effective April 28, 2018.  I
accept the uncontested testimony and evidence of the Landlord and am satisfied
that the Tenant has not paid the total rent he was required to pay for the
period from April 1, 2018 to July 31, 2018.  
L2 application – Tenant has Substantially
Interfered with Reasonable Enjoyment
     
Incidents Detailed in the First N5 Notice
 
8.     
A Notice to End the
Tenancy for Interfering with Others (Form N5) was served on the Tenant on
March 20, 2018.  The notice alleges that the Tenant has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege
or interest of the Landlord or another tenant.  The Landlord’s
witness testified to the incidents outlined in the first N5 Notice.  
9.     
The residential complex is
comprised of two apartment buildings:  the Tenant lives in one of the buildings
and the Landlord lives in the other.  The Landlord's witness acts as an
informal superintendent for the Landlord.  On March 12, 2018, she testified
that she received complaints from other residents of the Tenant’s building that
the Tenant had been engaged in a loud argument with his girlfriend which
started at approximately 7:30 a.m. and woke up other residents.  The Landlord's
witness delivered a warning letter to the Tenant after this incident.  When the
Landlord's witness spoke to the Tenant, he apologized for the incident and said
he would refrain from unreasonably noisy behaviour in the future.  The very
next day, on March 13, 2018, there was another very loud argument between the
Tenant and his girlfriend, and during that argument the Tenant called the police. 
On March 18, 2018 and March 20, 2018 during the middle of the night, the
Landlord's witness received complaints from other residents about the Tenant
and his girlfriend yelling and screaming at each other, disrupting the sleep of
other residents. 
Incidents Detailed in the Second N5 Notice 
 
10.  
The second Notice to End
the Tenancy for Interfering with Others (Form N5) was served on the Tenant
on May 6, 2018.  The notice alleges that the Tenant has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. 
The Landlord’s witness also testified to the incidents outlined in the second
N5 Notice.  
11.  
On April 22 and 23, 2018, in
the middle of the night on both nights, the Landlord's witness received
complaints from several neighbours about the Tenant and his girlfriend creating
more disturbances with loud arguing, screaming and fighting.
12.  
The Landlord's witness
testified she had personally heard the Tenant and his girlfriend fighting
sometime in May 2018 after service of the second N5 notice.  The Landlord's
witness received yet another complaint about the Tenant and his girlfriend
loudly fighting in the rental unit.  The Landlord's witness attended the
apartment building and heard the Tenant and his girlfriend screaming and
swearing at each other in the rental unit.  The Landlord's witness found pieces
of a broken remote control in the hallway outside the Tenant’s rental unit. 
The Landlord's witness knocked on the door of the rental unit and the Tenant
answered.  The Tenant said he was sorry and promised to keep the noise down.
13.  
The Landlord submitted a
hand-written letter from a resident of the Tenant’s apartment building as
Exhibit # 1.  In the letter, which is dated April 23, 2018, the writer sets out
that he lives a few door down from the Tenant, and says the fighting between
the Tenant and his girlfriend has been disturbing him for months.  The letter
writer describes being disturbed by noises from the Tenant’s rental unit such
as yelling, name-calling, door slamming, kicking doors, and people coming in
and out of the rental unit at all times of the day and night.  The letter is
unsigned.  The Landlord’s Agent said the letter writer was fearful of reprisal
from the Tenant, and did not want to identify himself.  The letter writer was
not present at the hearing to testify.  
Analysis:
 
14.  
The first N5 notice was
served pursuant to section 64 the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (‘the
Act’).  That section sets out that a landlord can give a notice of termination
if the conduct of the tenant is such that it substantially interferes with the
reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex for all usual purposes by the
landlord or another resident.  That section also provides that the notice of
termination is voided if the tenant stops the offending conduct during the
seven days following the service of the notice; in this case from March 21 –
27, 2018.  The testimony of the Landlord's witness was vague as to whether the
Tenant voided the first notice.  The Landlord's witness said the noise from the
rental unit was reduced “for a little while” after service of the first N5
notice, but started back up again.  The recent amendments to the Act have
removed the requirement for a landlord to prove the first N5 notice was voided
before they can serve a second N5 notice, therefore it is irrelevant whether
the first N5 notice was voided in this case. 
15.  
The second N5 notice was
served pursuant to section 68 of the Act. That section entitles the Landlord to
serve a non-voidable N5 if there is another incident that occurs more than
seven days but less than six months after the Landlord served the first N5
notice.  As there is no ability to void second N5 notices, the Landlord was
entitled to file the application to evict the Tenant.
16.  
I accept the uncontested
testimony of the Landlord’s witness, and find that the Landlord proved, on a
balance of probabilities, that the Tenant and his guest(s) have substantially
interfered with the Landlord's and the other tenants' reasonable enjoyment of
the residential complex by repeatedly engaging in loud and disruptive fights in
the rental unit when other residents are trying to sleep.  
17.  
The bulk of the Landlord’s
evidence in this case is hearsay.  The Landlord's witness provided direct
testimony about only one instance where she personally heard the noise from the
Tenant’s rental unit; and this occurred after the service of the second N5
notice.  While hearsay evidence is permitted in Board proceedings, it is given
less weight than direct testimony.  The hearsay evidence that other residents
are negatively impacted by the excessively noisy arguments in the Tenant’s
rental unit supports the direct evidence from the Landlord’s witness.  I find
no reason to question the reliability or accuracy of the Landlord’s witness’ testimony.
Relief from Eviction:
 
18.  
Having found the Landlord
has proven the allegations in its application, I will turn my mind to relief
from eviction, as required under section 83 of the Act.  
19.  
The Landlord’s witness testified
that the Landlord has addressed the issue of the Tenant’s loud and disturbing
conduct in the residential complex with the Tenant on a number of occasions. 
The Tenant has apologized and promised to keep the noise down, but ultimately
has been unable or unwilling to stop his disruptive behaviour.  The Tenant’s
actions are preventing the Landlord from meeting its obligations to ensure
other residents can reasonably enjoy the residential complex, as the fighting
and noise from the Tenant’s rental unit is repeatedly disturbing others. 
Considering this and all other disclosed circumstances, I find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.  
20.  
This order contains all of
the reasons for this matter, and no other reasons will issue.
It
is ordered that:
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before July 22, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $2,694.66*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to July 11, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $37.81 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
July 12, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before July 22, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from July 23,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before July 22, 2018, then starting July 23, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 23, 2018.
