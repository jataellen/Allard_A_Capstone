Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-36044-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


807, 2292 WESTON
ROAD TORONTO ON M9N1Z2


 




Between:


Services &
  Housing In The Province


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Melina
Pavlovic


Tenant



 
 
 
Services &
Housing In The Province (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Melina Pavlovic (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay compensation for damage the Tenant owes because the
Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on
February 12, 2021 with respect to application TNL-24238-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant has not met the
following conditions specified in the order:
The Tenant failed to pay $300.00 towards damages on or before
November 1, 2021
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for compensation for damage caused by the Tenant and the resulting order required the Tenant to pay an amount for damage. Accordingly, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for
compensation for damage.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $7,175.00 for compensation for damage and the costs related to the Landlord's
application fee in Order TNL-24238-20. The amount that is
still owing from that order is $6,275.00 and that amount
is included in this
order. As a result, the previous
order TNL-24238-20 is cancelled.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TNL-24238-20 is cancelled.

2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 17, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $6,275.00*. This amount represents the unpaid compensation for damage and the costs
related to the application fee for the previous
application.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $25.68
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 7, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
17, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 18, 2022 at .00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January
18, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 18, 2022.

The tenant has until January 16, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 16, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on July 18, 2022 if
the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
