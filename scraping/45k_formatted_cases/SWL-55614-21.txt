Craig Peter John Lock


Tenants




 
 
 
Homestead Land Holdings Limited
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Craig Peter and John Lock (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 20, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Crystal Sankey,
attended the hearing. As of 2:25 p.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the
Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 30, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,821.60.
 
4.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,867.40 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from April
1, 2021 to January 1, 2022.
 
6.     The Tenants paid $1,807.20 after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the

parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 11, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $6,557.10*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 31, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$59.89 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 1, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
11, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 12, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 11, 2022, then starting
February 12, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 12, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)   $8,635.40 if the payment is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)  
$10,457.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 11, 2022**.
If the Tenants
do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act
to set aside this order if they pay
the amount required under that subsection on or after February 12, 2022 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
