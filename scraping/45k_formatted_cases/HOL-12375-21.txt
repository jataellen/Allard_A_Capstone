Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12375-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


19 MAJESTIC STREET WHITBY ON L1N0H3


 




Between:


Yanmeng Zhang


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kevon Houlder


Tenant



 
 
 
Yanmeng Zhang (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kevon Houlder (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's
rent
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 956 0593 7653# on January
25, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s representative Yicheng Zhang attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has persistently failed
to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
2.     The Tenant did not pay December rent until January
24, 2022 and has not paid Jenuary rent.
 
3.    
The Tenant was not present to
request relief and the Landlord is seeking termination of the tenancy. I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from
eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of February
8, 2022. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 8, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
February 8, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 9, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.




File Number: HOL-12375-21
 
4.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 8, 2022, then starting February
9, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
5.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 9, 2022.
