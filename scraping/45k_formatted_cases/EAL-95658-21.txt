of the arrears, the Landlords
served a Notice of Termination effective May 15, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants vacated the rental unit on
December 12, 2021.
The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $2,250.00.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.

of $2,250.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.

is owing to the Tenants
for the period from August
30, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
