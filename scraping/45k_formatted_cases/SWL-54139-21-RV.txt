Review Order
 
2675586
Ontario Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Kevin Champagne
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved by order SWL-54139-21 issued on December
17, 2021.
 
On December
30, 2021, the Landlord requested a review of the order and that the order be
stayed until the request to review the order is resolved.
 
On January 6,
2022, interim order SWL-54139-21 -IN was issued, staying the order issued on
December 17, 2021. The Landlord
alleged that they were not
reasonably able to participate in the proceeding.
 
The request
was heard by video conference on January 25, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal
Representative, J. Kulikowski, attended the hearing. As of 9:39 a.m., the
Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
The Request
 
1.    
The Landlord
alleged that they were not reasonably able to participate in the original
proceedings of December 2, 2021, which resulted in order SWL-54139-21
dismissing the Landlord’s application.
2.    
In support of the
request to review the order, the Landlord stated that on the date of the
hearing, his mother was hospitalized and due to his involvement with her care,
forgot about the hearing.




 
3.    
Based on the uncontested
submissions made in the request, I am satisfied that the Landlord was not
reasonably able to participate in the proceeding. Therefore, the Landlord’s
application was heard afresh.
 
The L1 Application
4.    
The Tenant has not paid the total
rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to
December 31, 2021. Because of the
arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 21, 2021.
 
5.     The Tenant vacated the rental unit on November 30,
2021. The Tenant was in possession of
the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
6.    
The lawful monthly rent is $1,250.00.
 
7.    
The Tenant made no payments after the application was filed.
 
8.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,250.00
from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
9.     Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period from April 20, 2020 to August 21, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The request to
review order SWL-54139-21 issued on December 17, 2021 is granted. The order cannot be enforced.
 
2.    
The interim order issued
on January 6, 2022, is cancelled, and replaced with this order.
 
3.     The tenancy is terminated as of November 30, 2021, the
date the Tenant gave vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
4.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $3,137.45*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to November 30, 2021,
less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
5.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before March 3, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe
interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 4, 2022 at 2.00%
annually on the balance outstanding.
