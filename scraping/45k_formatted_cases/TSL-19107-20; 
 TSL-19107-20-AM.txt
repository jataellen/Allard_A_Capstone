AMENDED ORDER
 
This
order is amended
to correct a clerical error. The amendments are bolded for ease of
reference.
Centurion Property Associates Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Chowdhury Kaniz and Mahboob Chowdhury (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard via
videoconference on June 23, 2021
at 9:00 a.m.
 
The Landlord, represented by
Faith MacGregor, a licensed Paralegal, and the Tenants, Chowdhury Kaniz,
representing herself and Mahboob Chowdhury, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2019 to June 30,
2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October 28, 2020.
 
2.     The Tenant were in possession of the rental
unit when the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,787.11 $1,630.22
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,372.47 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
1, 2020 to October 28, 2020.




 
 
 
6.    
The Tenants paid $9,229.32
after the application was filed.
 
7.    
As of the hearing
date, the Tenant
owed the Landlord, $2,525.11including arrears
of rent to June 30, 2021
($2,339.11) and the application fee of $186.00. Since the hearing, another two rental periods
have begun, and another
two month’s rent have become
due. Therefore, the amount in this order includes July 2021 and August
2021’s rent. If the Tenant has paid the Landlord July 2021, and August 2021’s
rent, and /or made any payments to the Landlord since the hearing, the Landlord
shall deduct those payments from the amount owing in this order.
 
8.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenants attend the hearing to present evidence
or submissions in support of granting relief from eviction
and no circumstances were disclosed at the hearing or appeared in the
Board file. The Landlord sought a Standard Order. At the hearing, the
Landlord’s Legal Representative was amenable to extending the eviction date to
July 31, 2021. As this order is being issued on August 16, 2021, this extension
has effectively already been granted.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
August 27, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$4,643.45*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to August 16, 2021, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $53.09
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting August 17, 2021
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before August 27, 2021, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from August 28,
2021 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
August 27, 2021, then starting
August 28, 2021, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after August 28, 2021.




 
8.    
If, on or before August 27, 2021,
the Tenants pay the amount of $5,785.55** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after August 28, 2021 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
