File Number: TSL-25989-22
 



In the matter
of:


611, 470 GEORGE
STREET SOUTH PETERBOROUGH
  ON K9J3E4


 




Between:


Cobblestone Property Management Ltd


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Terence McRae


Tenant



 
 
On January 10, 2022, Cobblestone Property
Management Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Terence McRae (the
'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes
because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by
the Board on November 30, 2021 with respect to application TEL-19004-21.
 
The Board received email
correspondence from the Landlord on January 13, 2022 which requested an amendment to amend the L4 application to reflect the postal code as K9J3E4. The L4 application is amended to reflect
the postal code as K9J3E4.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed
to pay to the Landlord
$500.00 on or before December
15, 2021 towards arrears of
rent.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the
payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $9,870.18 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order TEL-19004-21. The amount that is still owing from that
order is $9,870.18 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order TEL-19004-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant
has also failed to pay the full rent that
became owing for the period from December 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,125.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January
1, 2021 to January 20, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TEL-19004-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 31, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$10,607.45*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to January 20, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $36.96
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 21, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before
January 31, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
February 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022, then starting February
1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 1, 2022.
 
 
January 20, 2022                                                                                 Date Issued                                                                       Kimberly

The tenant has until January
30, 2022 to file a motion
with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 30, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.




 
In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on August 1, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before
this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
