Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: SWL-55302-21



In the matter
of:


UNIT B, 3483 PETER
STREET WINDSOR ON N9C1J4


 




Between:


Gurbax Wahid


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Linda Rounding Ronald Rounding


Tenants



 
 
Gurbax Wahid (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ronald Rounding and Linda Rounding
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on January 13, 2022.
Only the Landlord attended
the hearing. As of 10:47 a.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at
the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from January 1, 2020 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective September 28, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in
possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,500.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants paid $7,386.00 after
the application was filed.
 
6.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before February 1, 2022.




File Number: SWL-55302-21
 
2.     The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $2,866.62*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 21, 2022.
 
3.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$49.32 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 22, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing*
on or before February 1,
2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 2,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 1, 2022, then starting February
2, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 2, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$3,500.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$5,000.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 1, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not
make full payment in
accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 2, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
