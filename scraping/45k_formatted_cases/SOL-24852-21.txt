Tenants




 


Brenden Mullin Crystal Robichaud


 



 
 
 
Tammy Franzen
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Brenden Mullin and Crystal Robichaud (the 'Tenants') because they, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential
complex have wilfully caused undue damage to the premises and/or used the
rental unit or the residential complex in a manner that is inconsistent with
use as a residential premises and that has caused or can be expected to cause
significant damage; and seriously impaired the safety of any person. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date and for the damage caused to the unit.
 
This
application was heard by video conference on January 18, 2022. The Landlord’s
Agent, Raymond Desmarais attended the hearing. As of 1:22 p.m., the Tenants
were not present or represented at the hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord filed with the Board a Certificate of
Service indicating that on December 20, 2021, the Landlord served the Tenants
with a Notice to End your Tenancy for Causing Serious Problems in the Rental
Unit or Residential Complex (N7).
 
2.     At the hearing, the Landlord contradicted the
information in their Certificate of Service by stating that the Tenants were
served with the notice on September 21, 2021.
 
3.     Irrespective of when the
notice was served, given that the
termination date in the notice is September 30, 2021, the Landlord did
not give the Tenants the notice at least 10 days prior to the termination date
as mandated by subsection 62 (2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006. This
makes the notice invalid.
 
4.     The Board cannot issue an order terminating the
tenancy without a valid notice of termination.
