Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44011-21



In the matter
of:


310, 625
FULTON BOULEVARD THUNDER
  BAY ON P7B6A8


 




Between:


Skyline Living


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Shujian Liu Yizhong
Cui


Tenants



 
 
Skyline Living
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Shujian
Liu and Yizhong Cui (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe. The Landlord also claimed administration charges related to
NSF cheques.
 
This application
was heard by video conference on January 13, 2022. Only the Landlord's Agent,
David Sager, attended the hearing.
As of 11:26 a.m. the Tenants
were not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the
total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 6, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
3.    
The lawful monthly rent is $873.39.
4.    
The Tenants have made no payments
since the application was filed.
5.    
The Landlord incurred charges
of $40.00 for administration charges
related to 2 cheques tendered by or on behalf of the
Tenants, which were returned NSF.
 
6.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $899.58 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit has been paid to the Tenants
up to April 30, 2021.
 
8.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with section
83 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord
attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenants, and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
the Act.




File Number: NOL-44011-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 4, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $5,095.51*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
24, 2022 and the total charges related
to the NSF cheques tendered to
the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenants, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $28.71
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 25, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or
before February 4, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 5,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 4, 2022, then starting
February 5, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 5, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)   $6,339.73 if the payment is made on or before
January 31, 2022,
or
ii)   $7,213.12 if the payment is made on or before
February 4, 2022**.
If the Tenants
do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 5, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
