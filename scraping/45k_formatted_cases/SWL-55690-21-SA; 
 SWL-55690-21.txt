Order under Section
78(11)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55690-21-SA
 
 



In the matter
of:


120 MYRTLE STREET
ST THOMAS ON N5R2G3


 




Between:


Jeremy Hill


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Angela
Mcclain


Tenant



 
 
 
Jeremy Hill (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Angela
Mcclain (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent
the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the
mediated settlement issued by the Board on October 4, 2021 with respect to
application SWL-50392-21.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved
by order SWL-55690-21, issued on November 3, 2021.
The Tenant filed a motion to set aside order SWL-55690-21.
 
This motion
was heard by videoconference on January 6,
2022.
 
The Landlord
and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
The Landlord was represented by Susana
Pereira.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The first issue before
the Board is whether or not there was a breach of order SWL- 50392-21 as
alleged by the Landlord. The Tenant
agrees that she breached by failing to pay $500.00 towards the arrears on each
of the following dates: August 24, 2021 and September 15, 2021; and by failing
to pay the rent for September 2021 in
full on or before September
1, 2021.
 
2.    
The second issue is
whether the Board is satisfied, having regard to all the circumstances, that it would
not be unfair to set aside the eviction order. (See: s. 78(11)(b) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').)
 
3.    
This tenancy
began two years ago. The monthly rent is $1,500.00 and is due on the first
of each month.
 
4.    
The Tenant testified
that the reason she breached the order was due to a change in her financial circumstances; in the past she was receiving the Canada Emergency Response




 
Benefit but that changed
to social services
benefits. However, she was able to pay
$3,000.00 on
September 20, 2021 for the missed payments and another $300.00 payment after that. Since then, she continued to breach the order by not making
any further payments to the Landlord.
 
5.    
The Tenant testified that she attempted
to reach the Landlord recently
to pay money, but the
Landlord was not responsive; however, the Tenant did not attempt to reach out
the Landlord’s representative.
 
6.    
Going forward,
the Tenant seeks a chance
to preserve her tenancy and proposes a thirty-
two-month repayment plan whereby the Tenant would pay the rent on time and
$500.00 on the 20th of each month until the
balance is paid in full.
 
7.    
The Tenant testified that she is a single parent with two children
ages 9 and 17. She is
currently unemployed and has been having a hard time paying the rent and
utilities.
 
8.    
On cross-examination,
the Tenant confirmed that she paid rent and arrears to the Landlord by electronic money
transfers and that there was no interference with her ability to pay the Landlord. She also
clarified that at the last hearing, the job she said she was going to start,
fell through. The Tenant further confirmed
that between July 14, 2021 and September 19, 2021, she made no payments to the
Landlord. The Tenant indicated that her mother had moved in mid-December 2021
and would be helping with the financial expenses but could not explain why the
rent nor the arrears payment was made for December 2021.
 
9.    
The Landlord seeks that the Tenant’s motion
to set aside be denied and the stay be
lifted immediately. The Landlord
submits that by consenting to a repayment
plan at the hearing held in
August 2021, the Landlord provided the Tenant with the opportunity to preserve
her tenancy instead of seeking eviction. However, the Tenant breached on the
very first payment and has since then, accrued further arrears.
 
ANALYSIS
 
10.  The Board’s expectation is that mediated
agreements will be complied with by
the parties. The parties appeared
before the Board in August 2021 and consented to an order for a repayment plan.
 
11.  There is no evidence before me suggesting
that something unexpected happened between the day of the hearing and the day
the first payment was due that prevented the Tenant from make the agreed
upon payment. While the Tenant testified that her source of income changed 18 days after the hearing, there was no
documentary evidence submitted to the Board in support of this assertion
nor was there any mention
of a change in the amount of benefits she received.
 
12.  Even if what the Tenant
is saying is true that her source of income changed to different
benefits, it is unclear why the Tenant continued to breach after the Tenant
received support from other government benefits, had her mother move in and
share expenses with her, etc.




 
13.  Given all the above, I find that it would
be unfair to set aside the eviction order. The evidence is insufficient to
establish the Tenant’s default was reasonable. Rather the evidence supports
the conclusion that the Tenant is either unwilling or unable to pay the rent.
 
14. 
As a result, the Tenant’s motion
is denied. As the motion is denied,
I must then consider when to
lift the stay of the order so the eviction can proceed.
15.  When I canvassed
this with the Tenant, she requested a delay in eviction of 30 days, so
that she could save for first and last month’s rent and make alternative living
arrangements. The Landlord opposed this request.
 
16.  With respect to the Tenant ’s request for
relief, given the Tenant’s personal circumstances and the length
of this tenancy,
I find a further delay to January
31, 2022 is appropriate.
 
17.  This order contains
all the reasons
for the decision within it. No further
reasons shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The motion
to set aside Order SWL-55690-21, issued on November
3, 2021 is denied.
 
2.    
The stay of order SWL-55690-21 is lifted January
31, 2022.
