Review Order
 
Raf Properties Inc (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Thomas Beauchamp (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved
by order SOL-17529-20 issued on May 4, 2021.
 
On June 6, 2021, the Landlord
requested a review of the order because
they believe they were
not reasonably able to participate in the hearing.
 
The request was heard by way of video conference on January 7, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Nilo Grabar attended the hearing. As of 2:11 pm, the Tenant was not present or represented at the
hearing although properly served notice of the hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
Landlord’s Request to Review
 
1.       
The Landlord’s Representative submitted that they never received the Notice of Hearing
for the hearing held on April 27, 2021. The Landlord’s Representative further
submitted that he religiously checks his email, including his junk folder for
emails from the Board and no Notice of Hearing was ever received. The Landlord’s Representative submitted
that the Landlord had no intentions of abandoning this application.
 
2.       
I am satisfied based on the
uncontested submissions of the Landlord’s Representative that the Landlord never
received the Notice
of Hearing and as such was not reasonably
able to participate in the Board hearing held on April 27, 2021.
 
3.       
The Landlord’s request to review the order is granted.




 
New Hearing
of Landlord’s L1 Application
 
4.       
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period from
July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
29, 2020.
 
5.       
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
6.       
The monthly rent is $895.00.
 
7.       
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $895.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
8.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenant for the period from August 15, 2019 to September 29, 2020.
 
9.       
The Tenant paid $5,900.00 after the application was filed.
 
10.   
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including he impact of
COVID-19 and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate repayment of the
arrears, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. In making this finding, I considered
the uncontested submissions of the Landlord’s Representative that he and the
Landlord have reached out to the Tenant on several occasions about repayment of
the arrears and the Tenant never responded.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.       
The Landlord’s request to review is granted.
 
2.       
Order SOL-17529-20 issued on April 28, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the following:
 
3.       
Unless the Tenant voids the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 29, 2022.
 
4.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $9,405.03*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
18, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
5.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$29.42 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 19, 2022 to
the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
6.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 29, 2022, then starting January
30, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.




 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 30, 2022.
 
9.       
If, on or before January 29, 2022,
the Tenant pays the amount of $10,866.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in
trust, this order for eviction will be void.
This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
10.    The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this
order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after January 30, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make
this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
