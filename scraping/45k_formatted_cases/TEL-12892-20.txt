In the matter
of:


UPPER, 627 RAPIDS
ROAD TWEED ON K0K3J0


 




Between:


Teah Vanderwey


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Tanya Crowe Troy
Macgregor


Tenants



 
 
 
Teah Vanderwey (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Troy Macgregor and
Tanya Crowe (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord requires possession of the
rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on August 3, 2021.
 
The Landlord, the Tenant,
Tanya Crowe, and the Tenants’
Legal Representative, Paula Stevens,
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord in good faith requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
2.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,375.00
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
3.     The Landlord paid the Tenant
compensation equal to one
month's rent on October 27, 2020. The Tenant acknowledge receipt
of this payment at the hearing.
 
4.     The Landlord testified
that she had a marriage
breakdown and that she is separating from her husband. A copy of the
separation agreement dated was provided dated August 28, 2020. I found the
Landlord to be credible as a witness. I am persuaded that the Landlord needs
the unit for residential occupation. The Landlord testified that the situation
is getting difficult for her and her
husband to continue residing in the same house.
 
5.     At the hearing, the Tenant raised several repair
issues under section 82. However, section 82 of the Act
state that a Tenant can raise repair
issues under section
82 only for




 
notice of termination given
under section 59 (Non-Payment of rent). This application was not
submitted under section
59; therefore, the Board cannot
consider these repair issues
in this application. If the Tenants wishes to have these repair issues address,
they must bring a separate Tenant application.
 
6.    
The Tenant submitted that she was
harassed by the Landlord, because she received several N5 notices in 2018 and
2019. However, at the hearing the Tenant testified that she signed a mediation
agreement with the Landlord on October 21, 2019. The Tenant failed to prove any
harassment on the part of the Landlord after signing the mediation agreement.
Once parties sign a mediation agreement, either party cannot rely on the facts leading
to the mediation agreement to prove harassment. The conduct of the parties after the mediation agreement was
signed is of utmost relevance to prove harassment. Parties are not held
indefinitely liable for their actions or inactions after a mediation agreement
is signed between them.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until
July 1, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. The Tenant stated that
she had young children and particularly her daughter who has been attending
school near the rental unit. The Tenant stated that it would be devastating for
her daughter to have to change school. I am mindful of the difficulty of having
to adapt to another school in the middle of the school year, especially given
the numerous interruptions that students had in the past couple of years as a
result of the pandemic. Consequently, I find it
reasonable to postpone
the eviction date until July 1, 2022 after the 2021-2022 school year.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated, as of
July 1, 2022. The Tenants
must move out of the rental unit on or before July 1, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$21,155.02, which represents compensation for the
use of the unit from October 31, 2020 to January 31, 2022, less the rent
deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$46.19 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from February 1, 2022 to
the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February 11, 2022, they will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February
12, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 11, 2022, then starting
February 12, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.




 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 12, 2022.
