Janice Goguen


Tenant



 
 
 
On November 5, 2021, B.P.M. (Mill
St) Development Limited (the 'Landlord') applied in this L4 application for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict Janice Goguen (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant failed to meet a
condition specified in the mediated
order issued by the
Board on April 22, 2021 with respect to L2 application SWL-46654-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The mediated order provided
that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section
78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy
and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following condition specified in the order: On or
about October 8, 2021, a guest of the Tenant interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment of the unit by swearing at another tenant regarding
the elevator. This was a breach of paragraph 1 of the mediated order.
This L4 application was filed within 30 days of the breach.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January
15, 2022 (standard 11 days from the issuance date of this order).
 
2.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.




File Number: SWL-57019-21
 
3.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 16, 2022.

The tenant has until January 14, 2022 to file a motion with the Board

and the Board will schedule a hearing.

to the eviction expires on July 16, 2022 if the order has not been
