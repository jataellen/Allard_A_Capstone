Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19585-21



In the matter
of:


154 DURHAM
STREET WEST LINDSAY ON
  K9V2R5


 




Between:


Peter Trofimov


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Cyantal Carriere
  Daniel Walton


 
Tenants



 
 
Peter Trofimov (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Daniel Walton and Cyantal Carriere
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video
conference on January
5, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord attended
the hearing. As of 11:16 a.m. the Tenants were not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 18, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
3.    
The lawful monthly rent is $2,400.00.
4.    
The Tenants have made no payments
since the application was filed.
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,400.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with section 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact
of COVID-19 on the parties and
whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the
Tenants, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.

It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 6, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$9,277.27*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 26, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $78.90
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 27, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or
before February 6, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 7,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 6, 2022, then starting
February 7, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 7, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenants
wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)  
$12,186.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022,
or
ii)  
$14,586.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 6, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not make full
payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline,
then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 7, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
