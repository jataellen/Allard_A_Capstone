Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-02876-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1601, 8 SILVER
MAPLE COURT BRAMPTON ON
  L6T4N6


 




Between:


BCIMC Realty Corporation c/o Quadreal Residential Properties G.P. Inc.


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Meenakshi Sethi


Tenant



 
 
 
BCIMC Realty Corporation c/o Quadreal Residential Properties G.P. Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Meenakshi Sethi (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has been persistently late in
paying the Tenant's rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 6,
2022.
 
Only the
Landlord's Legal Representative, Bryan Rubin, attended the hearing. As of 10:24
a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
Based on the particulars contained in the N8 Notice
of Eviction served
to the Tenants on September 15, 2021, I find that from
August 2020 to September 15, 2021, the Tenant were late paying the rent 14
months out of the 14-month period.
 
2.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,671.98 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
3.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from August 1, 2020 to November 30, 2021.
 
4.    
The Landlord’s Legal
Representative submitted that the Landlord is seeking a standard 11-day eviction
order. The Tenant has only paid the rent on time once since the N8 notice was served, and this payment was
the only one made; the Tenant owes in excess of
$13,000.00 in rental arrears.
 
5.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant




File Number: CEL-02876-21
 
relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1)
of the Act. The Tenant did not attend
to present any section 83 issues to consider with respect to how this
tenancy could be preserved and the Representative is not aware of any section
83 considerations.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
January 21, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 21, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $695.58,
which represents compensation for the use of the
unit from December 1, 2021 to January 10, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord
owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $57.80
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from January 11, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
January 21, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from January 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 21, 2022, then starting
January 22, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 22, 2022.
