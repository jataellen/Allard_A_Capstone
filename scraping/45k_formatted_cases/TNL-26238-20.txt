1351895 Ontario
Ltd O/a Elmpark Manor (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Ross Hamilton (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently
caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage;
and because the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the
residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 14, 2021. The Landlord was represented by David Strashin. The Tenant was represented by Hanson Sone.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
This application is based on a nonvoidable
Notice of Termination (form ‘N5’) served on the
Tenant on May 5, 2020 with a termination dater
of May 30, 2020 because
a person permitted in the
residential complex by the Tenant has substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment or lawful rights,
privileges or interests
of the Landlord or another tenant by causing a disturbance at
the rental office.
 
2.    
The application was filed pursuant
to s. 68 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) which states:
 
(1)   A landlord may give a tenant notice
of termination of the tenancy
if,
 
(a)         
a notice
of termination was given to the tenant
under section 62, 64 or 67;
and
 
(b)         
more than seven days but less than six months after the notice
mentioned in clause (a) was given to the tenant,
an activity takes place, conduct
occurs or




File Number: TNL-26238-20
 
a situation
arises that constitutes grounds for a notice of termination under section 60, 61, 62, 64 or 67, other than an activity, conduct
or a situation that is
described in a subsection 61(1) and that involves an illegal act, trade,
business or occupation described in clause 61(2)(a).
 
3.    
In this case the Tenant
was served the first notice of termination N5 at 9 a.m. on May 5, 2020,
according to the Certificate of Service filed with the application. The second N5 was served on the Tenant at
3:03 p.m. of May 5, 2020, according to the Certificate of Service. The
application was filed May 6, 2020. Both notices relate to the behaviour of the
Tenant’s guest, James Yong. The
Tenant was not afforded the opportunity to void the first notice as required by s. 70 of the Act which says “A landlord may not apply to the Board for an order terminating a
tenancy and evicting the tenant based on a notice of termination under sec. 62,
62 or 67 before the seven-day remedy period specified in the notice expires.” In this case the voiding period of the
first notice is May 6, 2020 to May 12, 2020.
 
4.    
Notwithstanding my comments made at the hearing, the application is dismissed because the Landlord did not have a right
to file the application during the voiding period afforded by the original
Notice of Termination as required by s. 70.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The application is dismissed.
