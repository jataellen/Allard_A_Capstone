Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-04395-22
 
 



In the
  matter of:


11 FAIR OAKS PLACE BRAMPTON ON L6Y4X1


 




Between:


Peel Housing Corp O/A Peel
Living


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Keisha Smith


Tenant



 
 
 
Peel Housing Corp O/A Peel Living
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Keisha Smith (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued
by the Board on June 21,
2021 with respect to application CEL-97164-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order: the Tenant
did not pay $265.29 on or before
December 1, 2021, nor did they pay the lawful rent for December also due on or
before December 1, 2021.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $2,122.33 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order CEL-97164-20. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $1,775.33 and that amount
is included in this order. As a result, the previous order CEL-97164-20 is
cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from July 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $298.02 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from January 1, 2021 to
January 18, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order CEL-97164-20 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 29, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
pay to the Landlord $2,213.69*. This amount represents the rent owing up to December 31, 2021 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $9.99 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
January 29, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
January 30, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before January 29, 2022, then starting January
30, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 30, 2022.
 
 
January 18, 2022

The tenant has until January 28, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 28, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction

the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
