Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Numbers: SWL-18712-18 and
SWL-18713-18
 
CG
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict DD and
PM (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe (SWL-18712-18).
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenants because they have been persistently late in
paying their rent.  The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date (SWL-18713-18).
 
This application was heard in [CITY] on July 18, 2018. 
The Landlord’s Legal Representative, TE, attended the hearing.  As of 11:39
a.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board. 
 
Determinations:
 
SWL-18712-18 – Arrears of Rent 
 
1.     
Section 59 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (‘the Act’) sets out that a landlord may give a tenant
notice of termination of their tenancy if the tenant fails to pay rent lawfully
owing under a tenancy agreement (N4 notice).  In this case, because the Tenants
were in arrears of rent, the Landlord served an N4 effective June 26, 2018.  I
accept the uncontested testimony and evidence of the Landlord and am satisfied
that the Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the
period from June 1, 2018 to July 31, 2018.   
2.     
The Tenants are in
possession of the rental unit. 
3.     
The monthly rent is $2,100.00.
4.     
The Tenants have made no
payments since the application was filed.  
5.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $2,100.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from September 1, 2017 to June 26, 2018.
SWL-18713-18 – Persistent Late Payment of Rent 
 
7.     
The Tenants moved into the
rental unit in September 2017.  They signed a one year lease, which ends August
31, 2018.  Rent is due on the first of the month.
8.     
The Tenants have persistently
failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.  In the past ten months, the
Tenants have paid rent late seven times.  The rent payments ranged from seven
days to one month late.  
9.     
Section 58 of the Act sets
out that a landlord may give a tenant notice of termination of their tenancy if
the tenant has persistently failed to pay rent on the date it becomes due and
payable (N8 notice).  The Landlord served the Tenants with an N8 notice on June
29, 2018 that is effective August 31, 2018. I accept the uncontested testimony
and evidence of the Landlord and am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities,
that the Tenants have persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was
due.
Two Applications
Filed by the Landlord 
10.  
As the successful applicant,
the Landlord is entitled to seek the application fees for the applications.  In
this case, the Landlord filed two applications on the same day.  Had the
Landlord filed his applications in person, they would have been processed as a
combined application, and the Landlord would have been charged only one filing
fee.  
11.  
Applicants are not allowed
to use the e-file system to file a combined application.  In this case, the
Landlord chose to e-file the applications separately and was charged both
filing fees.  I do not think it is fair for the Tenants to pay for the second
application filing fee, as the Landlord made a choice to incur this fee for the
convenience of e-filing both applications.  Therefore, I am awarding the
Landlord only one of the two application filing fees.   
Relief from Eviction
12.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
13.  
This order contains all of
the reasons for this matter, and no other reasons will issue.


 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenants void the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before August
3, 2018.
2.     
As of the date of this
order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the Landlord is
entitled to by $96.83*.
3.     
However, the Landlord is
authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the Landlord owes
the Tenants:
a)   
$69.04 per day for
compensation for the use of the unit starting July 24, 2018 to the date the
Tenants move out of the unit, and;
b)   
$175.00 for the cost of
filing the application.
4.     
The Landlord or the Tenants
shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
5.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before August 3, 2018, then starting August 4, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
6.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after August 4, 2018.
7.     
If the Tenants wish to
void this order and continue the tenancy to August 31, 2018, they must pay to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
a)   
$2,750.00 if the payment is
made on or before July 31, 2018, or
b)   
$4,850.00 if the payment is
made on or before August 3, 2018**.
If
the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by
the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.


8.     
If the Tenants comply
with paragraph 7, then:
a)   
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental
unit on or before August 31, 2018.
b)   
If the unit is not vacated
on or before August 31, 2018, then starting September 1, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
c)   
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after September 1, 2018.
d)   
The Tenants have no right to
void this part of the Order under subsection 74(4) of the Act.
