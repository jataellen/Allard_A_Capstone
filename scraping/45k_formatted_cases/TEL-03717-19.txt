Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-03717-19
 
 
 
 
PPIL (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
HNM and MJ (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 19, 2021 at 10:45am.
 
Only the Landlord
attended the hearing.
The Landlord was represented by DC.
Also in attendance was the Landlord’s witness, DL.
Determinations:
 
PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
1.    
This application first
came before the Board on September 18, 2019 where it was adjourned as additional time was required
to hear the matter. Both the Landlord
and the Tenant were in
attendance.
 
2.    
The next time the application came before
the Board was on January
15, 2020 where the
matter was adjourned at the Landlord’s request as they had changed their legal
representation firm who were unavailable on the day of the hearing. This adjournment was peremptory on the
Landlord. At this hearing, the Landlord’s former representative and the Tenants
were present.
 
3.    
At the hearing on March
12, 2021, only the Landlord’s representative, BR, was present; I adjourned the matter on
this day as it was apparent that the Landlord’s representative had not reviewed
the hearing recording and out of an abundance of caution due to the possibility that the Tenants
were not served
with the notice
of hearing since they moved
out of the rental unit on November 30, 2020.




 
4.    
At the hearing on
October 19, 2021, once again, only the Landlord’s representative was present. I heard evidence
of his personal efforts to reach the Tenants such as calling
the last known phone number for the Tenant which was disconnected, no
email address provided by the Tenant, sending the disclosure to the rental unit
with the hope that it would be forward to the Tenant (the Landlord rep advises
this was not returned back to
the Landlord’s
office) and looking up the Tenants’ information on 411 but not finding anything there.
I am satisfied the Landlord
has complied with the interim
order issued on March 17, 2021 to make best efforts in
connecting with the Tenants.
 
5.    
I proceeded to hear the Landlord’s claim for rent arrears and the Landlord’s response to the
issues raised by the Tenants at the hearing on September 18, 2019.
 
L1 APPLICATION
 
6.    
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from October 1, 2018 to October
31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective July 26, 2019.
 
7.    
The Tenants
were in possession of the rental
unit.
 
8.    
The Landlord’s
uncontested evidence was the Tenants vacated the rental unit on November 30, 2020. As such, the request for eviction under this application was no longer
necessary.
 
9.    
According to the Landlord’s ledger, the Tenants
paid $17,773.00 after the application was filed.
 
10. 
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,280.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
11.  Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
1, 2019 to July 26, 2019.
 
12. 
The Landlord
seeks an order for the arrears and costs owing. TENANT’S EVIDENCE
13.  At the hearing
on September 18, 2019,
the Tenants dispute
the following:
 
a)    
The second-named Tenant, MJ, was a co-signor
and not a Tenant of the
rental unit;
 
b)    
The Tenants
did not receive a notice of rent increase
for April 2020;
 
c)     
The lawful
monthly rent is incorrect as the Tenants
cancelled a locker
effective July 1, 2019; and
 
d)    
The amount claimed on the notice
of termination is
incorrect.




 
Is MJ a
Tenant?
 
14.  At the hearing on September 18, 2019, the
second-named Tenant, MJ, testified that he was
not a Tenant of the rental unit, rather, a co-signor. MJ presented a letter dated March
26, 2018 listing him as a co-tenant in support of his assertion. He testified that he resided in the rental unit as an
occupant.
 
15.  The Landlord maintained the position that
MJ was listed as a Tenant on the lease; there were no guarantors in the file with respect
to this tenancy; any correspondence including notices of rent increase were addressed to both
Tenants and the occupants section did not list MJ as a named individual.
 
16.  I permitted the Landlord
to submit a copy of the lease
agreement by September
20, 2019 as a post-hearing
submission. The lease agreement shows the second-named Tenant listed as a
Tenant on the lease with co-tenant beside his name; the lease was also signed
by both Tenants. Under the occupants section of the lease, MJ’s name was not listed.
 
17.  Based on the evidence before
the Board, I find that MJ
is a
Tenant of the rental unit and both the N4 notice of
termination and the L1 application name him properly.
 
Notice of Rent Increase
for April 2020
 
18.  The Tenants testified
that they did not receive
the notice of rent increase
that was to take
effect April 2020. As such, the rent claimed by the Landlord is incorrect as it
is based on an increased amount. The Tenants maintained that the rent was
$1,302.50 before they cancelled the locker effective July 1, 2019.
 
19.  At the hearing on October 19, 2021, the
Landlord’s witness, DL, who is the property administrator testified
that the server of the notice of rent increase
that was to take effect April 2020 was not available;
further, the superintendent of the property was no longer employed by the
Landlord.
 
20.  DL testified that the Tenants rent increased every April and that the general process with respect to these notices was either the superintendent or the property
administrator hand delivered
them or put them through the mail slot of each unit. Furthermore, the building
had 52 units and no other tenants complained about not receiving the notice of
rent increase during that period.
 
21.  Aside from the notice of rent increase
dated December 2, 2019 to take effect April 1, 2020, the Landlord did not produce
any evidence confirming service of this notice to the
Tenants. Given the above, based on the evidence before the Board, I am not
satisfied that the notice of rent increase for April 2020 was served to the Tenants.
 
22.  While other tenants may not have complained
about not receiving the notice of rent increase, I find that to be irrelevant as this is a separate
tenancy. Absent anything
more, I find the lawful
monthly rent continued to be $1,302.50 effective April 2020 onwards.




 
Locker Cancellation effective July 2019
 
23.  The Tenants testified that they cancelled
one of their lockers in July 2019 after they moved back into the rental unit.
The Tenants confirmed that while they did not provide a written notice to the Landlord, they spoke to the superintendent R, advising her of
such.
 
24.  The Landlord submits
that the Tenants
rented two lockers
in February 2019, after the fire
in their unit; since then, the Landlord has not received any notice of
cancellation for this tenancy and as previously mentioned, R is no longer at the building
and could not be present to testify. Furthermore,
the building policy has always been to put such requests in writing and
document these requests in the requestor’s file.
 
25.   Based on the
evidence before the Board, I find the evidence is insufficient to establish
that the Tenants cancelled a locker effective July 1, 2019. I say this as there
was no documentation before me nor did the Tenants
produce the superintendent, R, to confirm their
assertion. Thus, I find the rent remained $1,302.50 effective July 2019 onwards.
 
Amount on the
N4 Notice of Termination
 
26.  The Landlord’s L1 application is based on a N4 notice of termination served the Tenants on July 12, 2019 with a
termination date of July 26, 2019. This N4 claims rent for the period October
2018 and July 2019.
 
27. 
The Tenants testified
that between October 6, 2018 and May 31, 2019, the Tenants did not reside in
the rental unit because there was a
fire in their unit and the Tenants
had to move out for the Landlord
to conduct repairs.
During this period,
the insurance company paid the rent as reflected on the
Landlord’s ledger.
 
28.  The Tenants testified that they received
keys to the rental unit on June 1, 2019 after they complained to the Rental
Housing Enforcement Unit; however, because they had to provide notice to their
landlord, they could not move into the unit until July 1, 2019. Thus, they do not believe
they should be responsible for the rent for June 2019. This is because the Landlord had previously told
them the unit was ready for move in effective April 2019 and they had provided
their current landlord with a notice to move out, only to find out that they could not move in, due to
insurance issues in April 2019.
 
29.  The Landlord’s evidence was the rent for
the period October 6, 2018 to March 2019 was paid by the insurance company. The
Landlord waived the rent for the months of April 2019 and May 2019 as a unit inspection was required to obtain an occupancy permit
from the Building Code department before it was turned over to the
Tenants. The Tenants received keys to the rental unit on June 1, 2019 and were
entitled to move into it as of that date; they had possession of the rental
unit as of that date and should be held responsible for the rent for June 2019.
 
30. 
Based on the evidence
before the Board,
I find the Tenants are responsible for the rent for
June 2019. I say this based on the Tenants’
own evidence that they had keys to the




 
unit effective
that date and were able to have possession as of that date but chose not to
do so.
 
31.  Subsection
13(2) of the Act states:
 
(2) A tenancy agreement
takes effect when the tenant
is entitled to occupy the rental unit, whether or not the
tenant actually occupies it.
 
32.  As such, I find that between the period of
October 2018 to July 2019, the Tenants owed the Landlord $73.11 for the two
lockers that were in use for the months of March 2019 – May 2019 - that was not
paid by insurance or waived by the Landlord, less the interest credit on their
account for the year 2018 ($16.89)
plus the rent for June 2019 ($1,302.50) and the balance of the rent that was
not paid for July 2019 ($52.50) and the rent for the period October 1 – 6, 2018
($246.60 – which is not a deductible as claimed by the Tenants). In other words,
I find the amounts claimed
on the N4 notice of termination to be
correct.
 
33.  Furthermore, contrary to the Tenants’ assertion, the amount owing for the period October 1-6, 2018 was not paid by
insurance and remains outstanding.
 
34.  For ease of reference for all parties
I find the rent for the following
periods to be as
follows:
 
a)    
Between October
2018 – January 2019, the rent was $1,250.00;
 
b)    
Between February
2019 – March 2019, the rent was $1,280.00 (addition
of 2 lockers x $15.00); and
 
c)     
Between April 2019 – November 2020 the rent was $1,302.50.
 
35.  Thus, I find the arrears
and costs owing to November
30, 2020 less the
last month's rent deposit totals $3,448.65.
 
36.  The Landlord incurred
costs of filing the application and is entitled
to its reimbursement in the
amount of $175.00.
 
37.  As the Tenants
have moved out of the rental unit and were not present
at the hearing to provide
submissions with respect to repayment of the arrears outstanding, a standard
order shall issue.
 
38.  This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated as of November 30, 2020.




 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $3,448.65*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to
November 30, 2020, less the rent deposit
and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
The total amount owing under this order is $3,623.65.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before
January 18, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 19,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
