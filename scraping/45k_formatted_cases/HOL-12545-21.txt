Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12545-21
 
 
In the matter of:      4 BEEBALM LANE
HOLLAND LANDING
ON L9N0T4
 




Between:                  Qiang Sun Anni Li


Landlords




 
 
and
 




Alena Liashkevich Siarhei Tchilievich


Tenants




 
 
 
Qiang Sun and Anni Li (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Alena Liashkevich and Siarhei Tchilievich (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February
17, 2022. The Landlord,
Anni Li, the Landlord's Legal Representative, Yun
Tao Li, and the Tenant, Siarhei Tchilievich, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective November 2, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $2,800.00.
 
4.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $2,800.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from August
31, 2020 to November 2, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed. The Tenants
state that they have attempted to make payments to the Landlords but the
Landlords have refused to pick up the cheque. Accordingly, the Tenants dispute
the filing fee. The obligation is on the Tenants to send the payment to the
Landlords. The Tenants could




 
have sent the Landlords the rent
cheques rather than them waiting for the Landlord to pick up the cheque.
The Landlords are entitled to the filing
fee because the Tenants are in arrears.
 
7.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
8.     The Tenants state that they have the funds required to
pay the arrears and void this order. The Tenants further state they can make
the payment on February 18, 2022. Therefore,
the parties agreed
to a standard order with the termination date below. If the
Tenants pay the amount required to void the order, they will be able to remain
in the rental unit.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $12,922.21*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 18, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlords
$92.05 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 19, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before February
28, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 28, 2022, then starting
March 1, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 28, 2022, the Tenants pay
the amount of $16,986.00** to the Landlords or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after March




 
1, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
