In the matter
of:


ONE BEDROOM (UPPER), 62 AVANDALE BLVD BRAMPTON ON L6T1H4


 




Between:


Mandip Singh
Thind


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Sanjeev Sehgal


Tenant



 
Mandip Singh Thind (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sanjeev Sehgal
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant entered
into an agreement to terminate
the tenancy.       (L3 application)
 
This L3 application was sent by a Duty Member to a Board
hearing so that the merits
of the L3 application could be heard.
 
The L3 application was heard by videoconference on February 9,
2022.
 
Only the Landlord’s Legal
Representative, Shahbaz Vardag,
attended the hearing.
As of 9:58 am, the Tenant was not present or represented, although the
Tenant was sent a Notice of Hearing by the Board. The hearing commenced on an uncontested basis at 9:58 am.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s Legal Representative (‘LLR’) submitted that the Landlord
became the new landlord when the rental unit was
purchased on or about March 3, 2021. The
LLR further submitted that the
tenancy with the Tenant was assumed by the Landlord. Subsequently the Landlord and the Tenant entered into an
agreement which was executed on April 20, 2021 and that agreement terminated
the tenancy on October 31, 2021. The
April 20, 2021 agreement and the Landlord’s declaration attesting to these
facts form part of the L3
application.
 
2.     The LLR then submitted that once October
31, 2021 had passed and the tenancy
had not terminated, the Landlord and Tenant were able to enter
into another agreement, this time in the form of an N11 agreement,
which was executed on January 29, 2022. The
LLR stated the termination date in the N11 is February 28, 2022, and the
Landlord requests a Board order to order that exact termination date.
 
3.    
I
asked for any circumstances that the Landlord
or LLR may be aware of in respect of the
termination date being requested. The
LLR provided me with his submissions on this.




 
4.    
In the interim period,
the Landlord filed
the current L3 application on December 6, 2021,
which I understood was done to preserve the Landlord’s rights.
 
5.    
The LLR affirmed he had provided
the Board with a copy of the signed N11 but at the time of the hearing, I
indicated that the Board’s legal records did not show anything. I acknowledged that sometimes there are delays
in time between
clients filing documents with the Board and when a Board
customer service officer actually appends the documents formally to the record. I therefore requested the LLR to submit
the signed N11 post-hearing, which I confirm was dutifully done by the LLR.
 
6.     I have reviewed
the signed N11 (exhibit
LL#1) and I find the agreement is in order
with a termination date of
February 28, 2022.
 
7.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated in a final (non-remedial) way as of February 28,
2022.
 
2.     The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before February
28, 2022.
 
3.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1,
2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
4.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 1, 2022.
 
5.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before February
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
