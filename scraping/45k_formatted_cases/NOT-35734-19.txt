Order under Sections 30 and 31
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOT-35734-19
 
 
 (‘RC’) and LP (the 'Tenants') applied for an order determining that RVPI, HD and JD (the 'Landlords') failed to meet the
Landlords' maintenance obligations under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') that the Landlords substantially interfered
with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by them
and that the Landlords withheld or deliberately interfered with the reasonable
supply of a vital service that the Landlords are obligated to supply under the
tenancy agreement.
 
This application was heard on
June 2, 2021 in Passcode 250 828 208 VC76 and on July 22, 2021in Passcode
215 965 491 VC 75. Only the Tenant
RC and the Tenants’ representative, (‘AB-S’), attended the hearing on June 2, 2021 and only the
Tenants’ representative, AB-S, attended the hearing on July 22, 2021.
 
This application is one of 16
related tenant applications against the Landlords concerning the effective shut down of a mobile
home park (the ‘Park’)
and certain maintenance and repair issues leading up to the time of the
effective shut down.
 
Refer to order NOT-33990-18-HR (the ‘Base Order’)
issued February 1, 2022, concurrently with this and the other 14 related individual Tenant
applications. That order sets out my determinations on the liability of the
Landlords pertaining to events leading up to the Park’s closure and the
availability of remedies related to the closure itself.
 
The application under file number NOT-33990-18 was a
multi-tenant T2 application brought
on behalf of fifteen
tenants identified in Schedule 1 to that order (‘Park
Tenants’), seeking relief for
the discontinuance of power to the Park. A
separate T6 application and/or T2 application was brought by each of the
fifteen Park Tenants, seeking relief for the Landlords’ actions and inactions
pertaining to the Park’s water supply, the Park’s sewage system and the
effective closure of the Park. This application under file NOT-35734-19 is one
of those applications.




 
 
 
The hearing of issues common to
all of the applications, meaning common to the application under file number NOT-33990-18 and the fifteen
individual applications, proceeded
to completion on July 22,
2022 in Passcode 215 965 491 VC 75 following a number of earlier appearances.
The hearing of the Tenant’s individual issues under file number
NOT-35734-19 proceeded on June 2, 2019. The procedural history
is set out in the Base Order.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
As set out in the
Base Order I find that that:
 
a)    
The Landlords withheld or interfered with the provision
of electricity, a vital service;
 
b)    
The Landlords failed to repair or maintain the Park’s sewage
system, allowing problems with sewage discharges and
significant odours over a period that extends back prior to one year prior to
the Tenant’s application filing in March 2019;
 
c)      The Landlords failed
to repair or maintain the Park’s water
system such that the supply of potable water was compromised
for roughly two weeks at the beginning of March 2018 and throughout the period
June through October 2018;
 
d)     The Landlords’ failures
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the units and the Park by the Tenants,
both prior to and after October 2018; and
 
e)    
The above failures, combined with
the Landlords’ decision to cease providing all services at the Park as of
October, 2018, attract various remedies, some pertaining to events leading
up to the October 2018 effective closure
and others pertaining to events
following that effective closure.
 
2.   
The Tenants claim for two classes
of remedies: first,
those attributable to the wrongdoing of the Landlords prior
to the Park’s effective
closure in October
2018;; and second;
those attributable to the Park’s closure.
 
3.    I find the following facts on the basis of the
uncontroverted testimony of the Tenant RC and,
where indicated, on certain documents filed with the Board as Tab
G of the Tenants’ productions;
 
a)     The Tenants paid rent of $267.70 per month at the Park beginning January 2018;
 
b)    
The Tenants stopped paying
rent at the Park following the receipt, in July 2018, of the Landlords’ notice
of Park closure.
The Tenants did not pay rent for the months
of July, August, September or
October 2018;
 
c)     
The water in the Park was shut off
every second night from the time the Landlords took ownership of the Park. The Tenants were without drinking
water from time to time throughout the period in which I have
found that the drinking water supply was compromised;




 
d)    
The Tenants enjoyment of their unit and the Park was impacted by the presence
of raw sewage, from time to time, under their unit and on the road in
the Park;
 
e)     The Tenants contributed $100.00 to the $1,000.00 cost of repairing an electric
transformer in the Park during the summer of 2018;
 
f)      
The Tenants were forced
to stay at the Park following its closure as they had nowhere
else to go until they managed to arrange new accommodation for the end of
January 2019;
 
g)     The Tenants ran a generator for power. They spent $150.00 per month for fuel from
November 2018 through January 2019;
 
h)    
The Tenants’ occupancy of the Park during the winter months following the Park’s effective
closure, living without running
water and supplying their own power, was difficult;
 
i)       
The Tenants vacated the Park on January 31,
2019;
 
j)       
The Tenants incurred $250.00
in moving costs;
 
k)     
The Tenants were unable to move or sell their mobile home such that its value, which the Tenant RC estimated at
$15,000.00; and
 
l)       
The Tenants paid rent of $750.00
per month for their new accommodation (The Tenant RC testified that the new rent was $775.00 but I
note that the communication
from Social Service to the Tenants dated December 28, 2018 states that he rent
for the new unit would be $750.00. I
find that it is more likely than not that the rent was
$750.00).
 
First Type of Remedies - for the Period
Prior to October 30 2018
 
4.   
For the first type of remedies, I
have considered compensation for events occurring between March
12 2018, being one year prior to the
date on this application was filed, and October 30, 2018, when the Park was
effectively closed.
 
5.   
I find that the Tenants are
entitled to a rebate of $13.39, being 5% of the $267.70 rent which they paid in
June 2018. This was the only month in
which the Tenants paid rent during the five period June through October
2018, when potable
water was compromised.
 
6.   
I
find that the Tenants are entitled to a rebate
of $93.70, being 10% of the
of the $267.70 monthly rent which they paid at the Park for the 3 ½
month period from mid-March 2018 (being one year before the filing of the Tenants’
application with the Board) through June 2018 (being the last month
they paid rent) for the impacts of the Landlords’ failure to maintain or repair
the sewage system.




 
7.   
I
find that the Tenants are entitled to compensation in the amount of $100.00
for their contribution to the
cost of the transformer repair in 2018.
 
Second Type of Remedies - Pursuant to the Park Closure
 
8.   
For the second type of remedies, as et out in the Base Order,
I find the following:
 
a)    
The Tenants are not entitled to compensation for the lost value of the mobile
home;
 
b)     The Tenants are entitled to compensation for the
increased cost of rent from the time they vacated the Park up to July 31, 2019 (being twelve months from the July 31, 2018 notice of Park closure);
 
c)     
The Tenants are entitled
to compensation for moving costs;
 
d)    
The Tenants are entitled
to compensation for their out of pocket
costs associated with living at the Park without water,
sewage or power services;
 
e)    
The Tenants may be entitled to damages for interference with reasonable enjoyment.
 
9.    The Tenants are entitled to compensation for the
$482.30 increased cost of rent for the 6 month
period following January
31, 2019, when they vacated
the Park, up to
July 31, 2019. I note, however, that the Tenants did not pay rent for
four months leading up to the Park’s effective closure. I find that the Tenants’ rental savings for that period should
properly be deducted from the amount payable by the Landlords for the rental
increase. I find that the Tenants are entitled to $1,823.00, comprised of rent
increase of $2,893.80 ($482.30 x 6) less $1,070.80 ($267.70 x 4).
 
10. The Tenants are entitled to compensation for their out of pocket cost of fuel to run their generator at the Park following the
effective closure of the Park. They
are entitled to
$450.00 ($150.00 x 3).
 
11. The Tenants are entitled to $250.00 in compensation for moving costs.
 
12. I find that the Tenants’ continued occupancy of the
Park in the face of its effective closure was reasonable in circumstances where they had no other place to go. That circumstance was directly linked to the inadequate notice given by the Landlords
for the Park’s closure. I find that the Tenants suffered
difficulties attributable to the expedited closure of the Park. I find that a damages award of $1,500.00
is appropriate in the circumstances.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlords shall pay to the Tenants a total of $4,230.09, representing payment for the following:
 
a)     rent abatement of $107.09 for the impacts
of the compromised water supply
and problems with the sewage system;




 
 
 
b)     $100.00 compensation for the costs of the transformer repair;
 
c)      $450.00 for the costs of fuel from November 2018 through January
2019;
 
d)     $250.00 for moving
costs;
 
e)     $1,823.00 for the increase in rent over 6 months
following the Tenants’ departure
from the Park (net of the rent withheld by the Tenants prior to the
closure); and
 
f)       $1,500.00 for damages.
 
2.    
The Landlords shall pay the Tenants
the full amount
owing by March 31, 2022.
 
3.    
If the Landlords do not pay the
Tenants the full amount owing by March 31, 2022 the Landlords will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from April 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
