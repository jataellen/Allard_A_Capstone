Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number:
TSL-21101-21




 
In the matter
  of:


 
407, 80 MARINE PARADE
DRIVE TORONTO ON M8V0A3


 




Between:


Victor Vieira


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kristy Darbishire


Tenant



 
 
 
Victor Vieira (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kristy Darbishire (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant
of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently
caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage.
 
This application was heard
by video conference on July 13, 2021, beginning
at 9:00 a.m..
 
The Landlord attended the hearing. As of 10:15 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at this
hearing although properly served with a notice of the hearing by the Board.
Maria Viera also attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Landlord seeks an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because
the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused undue
damage to the premises.
 
2.       
On March 3, 2021, the Landlord
served a voidable N5 Notice
to End Your Tenancy with a termination date of March 10, 2021. In this instance,
the N5 Notice provided a termination
date 7 days later, which did not permit the Tenant the full 7 days to void the
notice.
 
3.       
Pursuant to subsection 62(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, an N5 Notice
must provide a termination date no earlier than the 20th day after the notice is served.
 
4.       
Subsection 63(1)
states that, despite section 62, a landlord may give a notice of termination
with a termination date not earlier
than the 10th day after N5 Notice is served, if the landlord claims that the tenant, an occupant or a guest of the
tenant wilfully causes undue
damage to the rental unit or to the residential complex.




File Number: TSL-21101-21
 
5.       
The Landlord’s application appears
to rely upon section 63 of the Act. The earliest
termination date in this case would be March 12, 2021.
 
6.       
The Landlord’s application must be dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The Landlord’s application is dismissed, without
prejudice.
