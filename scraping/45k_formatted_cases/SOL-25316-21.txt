Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-25316-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


62, 50 HAYHURST ROAD BRANTFORD ON N3R2Z5


 




Between:


City Of Brantford Housing


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jaclynne Cainey
  Jayde Hotvedt


Tenants



 
 
City Of Brantford Housing (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jayde Hotvedt
and Jaclynne Cainey
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 1, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Jennifer Nichols, attended the hearing. As of 10:52 a.m.,
the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing although properly
served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period
from August 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective September 27, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent is $990.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants paid $284.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenants, and find
that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 18, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlord $2,363.84*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 7, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$32.55 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 8, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
18, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 19, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 18, 2022, then starting February
19, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 19, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 18, 2022, the Tenants pay
the amount of $3,293.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 19, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
