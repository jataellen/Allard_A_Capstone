Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
File Number: EAL-71135-18
 
 
ZA (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict MK and DM (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay
the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by telephone on April 6,
2018.  The Landlord and the Tenant, MK attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from January 1,
2018 to April 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice
of Termination.
2.  
The Tenants were in possession of the rental unit.
3.  
The monthly rent is $1,500.00.
4.  
The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
5.   The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,500.00
from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
6.   Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from December 1, 2014 o January 31, 2018.
7.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenants void the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before April
21, 2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $2,641.90*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to April 10, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $49.32 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting April 11, 2018 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before April 21, 2018, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from April
22, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before April 21, 2018, then starting April 22, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 22, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before April
21, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $5,510.00** to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy would not be
terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If this payment is not
made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after April 22,
2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants
are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
