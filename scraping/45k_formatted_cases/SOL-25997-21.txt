In the matter
of:


238 BLACKBURN DRIVE BRANTFORD ON N3T6S7


 




Between:


Jarabaculley Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Alexander Hauley
  Haylie Eady


Tenants



 
 
 
Jarabaculley Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Alexander
Hauley and Haylie Eady (the 'Tenants') because they, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have wilfully
or negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenants
to compensate the Landlord for the damage; and because they have been
persistently late in paying their rent.
 
This application was heard in
Passcode: 956 0593 7653# on February 9, 2022.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s Representative, Jordan Nieuwhof and the Tenants attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
N8 Notice:
 
1.     The N8 Notice lists 4 months the Tenant paid rent
late. The Tenant argued the Notice lacked details and was not enough to prepare a defence because
she believes 2 of the 4 months listed on the N8 Notice was paid
on time.
 
2.     Subsection 43(2) of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
states that a notice of termination must contain “reasons and
details respecting the termination”. The Ontario Divisional Court in Ball v.
Metro Capital Property and Lockhurst (December 19, 2002), Toronto Docket No.
8/02, found that subsection 43(2) of the former Tenant Protection Act,
which is very similar to the provisions in the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006, requires that a notice served upon a tenant must include dates and
times of the alleged offensive conduct with a detailed description of the
alleged conduct engaged in by the tenant.




 
3.    
As with the N8 Notice here,
I find the Notice did not contain
dates when rent was paid late
and I accepted the Tenant’s submissions she did not have enough information to prepare a defence. Without the specific
dates or a ledger that showed the payment dates, the Tenant can not reasonably
know the case required to be met. As such, the N8 Notice is void.
 
N5 Notice:
 
4.     I find the Tenants negligently caused undue damage to
the air conditioning unit by not blocking, preventing, or stopping their dogs’ habit
of urinating on the unit because of the
following:
 
5.     The Landlord replaced
the air conditioner unit and information on the invoice
indicates the suspected cause
of damage was animal erosion caused by urine.
The Landlord explained the coolant coils were blocked from the erosion
and could not be repaired.
 
6.     The backyard was fenced after the Tenant moved into the
unit to contain her two dogs. The Tenant confirmed her dogs defecate
in the yard unsupervised. The Tenant confirmed its not unusual for dogs to
mark their territory. Although she may not have witnessed her dogs urinating on the AC, the photograph
shows concentrated rust/erosion on a corner of the unit which is typical of
an area that is marked. It’s also not typical of erosion from the weather
elements as the erosion was concentrated on one corner at the bottom/base of
the AC within their dogs’ reach.
 
7.     The Landlord paid $3,672.60 to replace the unit as
supported by the invoice. The unit was previously repaired for other reasons
and is at least 13 years old (2008 when the Landlord took ownership). The useful
life of an air conditioning unit under O. Reg. 516/08 is 15 years; I find therefore the
reasonable replacement costs the Tenant owes the Landlord is $489.68
($3,672.60/15 x 2 years).
 
8.     The Tenants also wilfully or negligently caused undue
damage to the garage door. The photographs show the garage door cracked on the
upper panel in the shape of the
letter “T” that extended outwards about a foot in each direction. The damage
was not from normal wear and tear and was caused by something heavy hitting the
door. The Tenant states she doesn’t know what hit the garage and suspects it
could have been the wind that pushed something into the door. I find it
unlikely given the situation of the damage. The likely hood of something heavy
being lifted that high by wind is very low. The Tenant also never reported the damage to
the Landlord who inadvertently discovered the damage in May 2021. The Tenant testified she has initiated the
process of repairing the garage door which infers she accepts some
responsibility for the damaged door.
 
9.    
The Landlord has not repaired the garage door and gave a lump sum
of $500.00 to repair the door.
The Landlord did not obtain a quote or provide breakdown to
substantiate costs but neither did the Tenant challenge the amount claimed to
repair the damage.
 
10.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to




 
grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
The damage is not serious to
warrant eviction since the Tenant has been living in the unit since 2017.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     On or before
April 30, 2022,
the Tenants shall repair the garage door.
 
2.     If the Tenants
do not comply with paragraph 1, hereof, then on May 1, 2022 the Tenant shall pay the Landlord $500.00 for
reasonable costs to repair the garage door.
 
3.     On or before
April 30, 2022,
the Tenants shall pay the Landlord $489.68,
which represents the reasonable costs of replacing the air conditioner.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before May 1, 2022, they will start
to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from May
2, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
