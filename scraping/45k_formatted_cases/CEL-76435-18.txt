Order under Section 21.2

Statutory Powers

and the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-76435-18-RV
 











 
 

Review Order
 
MH (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict NA, MIA (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay
the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
The Landlord’s application was resolved by order
CEL-76435-18 issued on June 22, 2108. 
 
On June 27, 2018, one of the
Tenants, MIA, requested a review of that order.
 
A preliminary review of the review
request was completed without a
hearing in accordance with Rule 29.11 of the Board’s Rules of Practice.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants did not attend
the hearing that took place on June 20, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant who filed the
review request states that he was not reasonably able to participate in the
hearing because he was “out of town on company business”. 
3.     
The Board mailed two copies
of the Notice of Hearing, one for each Tenant, on June 4, 2018.
4.     
Pursuant to subsection
191(3) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006, (the ‘Act’) the Notice is deemed to have been given 5 days after mailing.
5.     
Given the large volume of
cases heard by the Board, it is not possible to schedule hearings in accordance
with a party’s work schedule. There are two Tenants listed in the order. There
is no mention of the second Tenant in the review request or why they could not
attend the hearing if the other Tenant was out of town on business.
6.     
On the basis of the limited submissions
made in the request, I am not satisfied that the Tenants were not reasonably
able to participate in the hearing.
7.     
If the Tenants want to preserve their
tenancy they may be able to make use of the options set out in paragraph 8 or 9
of the order if they pay the amount required to void the order.
8.     
The review request is denied
in accordance with Rule 29.11(c) of the Board’s Rules of Practice because the
grounds for considering a review are not satisfied.
It is ordered that:
The request to review order CEL-76435-18, issued
on June 22, 2018, is denied. The order is confirmed and remains unchanged.
