In the matter
of:


58 HYDRANGEA HOLLOW HOLLAND LANDING ON L9N0T1


 




Between:


Maryam Bakhshi


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Charles
Chessell Sokunthea Path


Tenants



 
 
 
Maryam Bakhshi
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Charles Chessell and Sokunthea Path (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe (L1
application).
 
The Landlord
also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants
because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in
the residential complex have wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the
Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the damage; and because they, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential
complex have substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after
the termination date (L2 application).
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on January 11, 2022.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord's Legal Representative, Katy Sanaye,
and Sokunthea Path, on behalf of the Tenants attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
L2 application
 
1.    
For the reasons that follow, the Landlord’s L2 application is dismissed.
 
2.    
On December
13, 2020 the Landlord served
a notice of termination because
the Tenant has substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex a lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord, and the Tenant caused willful or
negligent damage. The termination date on the notice was January 4, 2021.




 
3.    
The particulars in the
notice were with respect to the Tenants not paying the water and sewage bill, consequently it was transferred into the Landlords name. The amount
owing per the notice is $2,892.60.
 
4.    
It is undisputed that the Tenants vacated January 31, 2021, therefore, as eviction
is not necessary, the monies are being pursued
pursuant to section
89 of the Act; an order for payment based on damages.
 
5.    
Black’s Law Dictionary defines
damage as:
 
Loss, injury,
or deterioration, caused
by the negligence, design, or accident of one
person to another, in respect of the latter’s person or property.
 
6.    
Section 89 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’) says:
 
(1)    
A landlord may apply to
the Board for an order requiring a tenant to pay reasonable costs that the
landlord has incurred or will incur for the repair of or, where repairing is
not reasonable, the replacement of damaged property, if the tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or a person
whom the tenant permits in the
residential complex wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to the rental
unit or the residential complex and the tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
7.    
It should be noted that
effective September 1, 2021, section 88.2 of the Act came into force, and a Landlord
can now file the new L10 application which addresses the issue of unpaid utilities. With respect to L2 applications where the
Tenant was in possession at the time of filing, the application had to be filed
on or after September 1, 2021; here the application was filed December 22,
2020.
 
L1 application
 
8.    
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from October 1, 2020 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
January 31, 2021.
 
9.    
The Tenants
vacated the rental
unit on May 31, 2021. The Tenants
were in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
10.  The monthly rent is
$2,450.00.
 
11. 
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $2,450.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
12.  Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from May 24, 2019 to
January 31, 2021.




 
13.  The Tenants did not pay the Landlord
any monies after
the application was filed.
The total amount owing to the
Landlord up to January 31, 2021, the date the Tenants vacated, is
$7,496.24.
 
14.  The Tenants did not dispute the amount
owing but requested, due to COVID-19, one- year o repay the Landlord. the Landlord's Legal Representative submitted that a year was
unreasonable and requested the standard 11-days.
 
15.  I find requiring
the Landlord to waiting another
year before being able to pursue the debt
the Tenants’
owe to be unreasonable. The application was filed December
21, 2020, over a year ago, it is unfair and prejudicial to the Landlord to require them to wait another year before repayment can begin; no monies
have been received from the Tenants since September 2020.
 
16.  This order contains
all the reasons for the decision within
it. No further reasons shall be
issued.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s L2 application is dismissed.
 
2.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of January
31, 2021, the date the Tenants gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$7,292.24*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 31, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 6, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 7,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
