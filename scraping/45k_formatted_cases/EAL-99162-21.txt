Between:

Tenants



 
On December 21, 2021,Ottawa
Community Housing (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Marie Kabena Kanku and Jean-Pierre Kanku Balowayi (the
'Tenants') and for an order to have
the Tenants pay the rent they owe
because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued
by the Board on November
23, 2021 with respect
to application EAL-96073-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenants
if the Tenants did not meet certain
condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.    
I
find that the Tenants have not met the following
conditions specified in the order:
 
The Tenants
failed to pay to the Landlord $931.00
on or before December 1, 2021
towards rent. The Tenants paid
$850.00.
 
The Tenants
also failed to pay to the Landlord
$200.00 on or before December
20, 2021 towards arrears of rent and the filing fee.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenants were ordered
to pay $4,782.00 for rent arrears in Order EAL-96073-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $4,782.00 and
that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order
EAL-96073-21 is cancelled.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order EAL-96073-21 is cancelled.

2.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 1, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $4,863.00*. This amount represents the rent owing up to December 31, 2021.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$30.61 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 1, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
1, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 2,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 1, 2022, then starting
February 2, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 2, 2022.

The tenant has until January 31, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 31, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on August 2, 2022 if the order
has not been filed on or before
this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
