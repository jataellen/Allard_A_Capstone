In the matter
of:


130 HENRIETTA AVENUE SAULT STE. MARIE
ON P6C1Z8


 




Between:


Alisha Forbes


Tenant




 


 
and


 




 


Amanda
Lambert


Landlord



 
 
Alisha Forbes
(the 'Tenant') applied for an order determining that Amanda Lambert (the
'Landlord') entered the unit illegally and altered the locking system
on a door giving entry to the rental unit or residential complex
without giving the Tenant replacement keys. This is the T2 Application.
 
The Tenant
also applied for an order determining that the Landlord failed to meet the
Landlord's maintenance obligations under
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') or failed
to comply with health,
safety, housing or maintenance standards. This is the T6 Application.
 
These applications were heard together
on October 18, 2021.
 
Only the Tenant attended
the hearing. The Landlord
was not present
or represented by 3:57 p.m. although properly served with notice
of the hearing by the Board.
 
Reasons:
 
History
 
1.    
This is not the first time the parties have been before the
Board.
 
2.    
In NOT-34398-18, which
was filed on November 19, 2018, the Tenant alleged the Landlord entered the
rental unit illegally, changed the locks without giving replacement keys, substantially interfered with the Tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of the rental
unit or complex and harassed,
coerced, obstructed, threatened or interfered with the Tenant. This application
was resolved by a mediated agreement dated February 7, 2019.
 
3.    
The Tenant filed the T6 Application in this case on July 5, 2020.
 
4.    
The Tenant filed the original
T2 Application in this case on July 15, 2020. The only allegation on this T2 was that the Landlord
changed the locks or the locking system
to the rental unit or building
without giving the Tenant replacement keys.




 
5.    
These two applications, as well as the Landlord’s application in NOL-40288-20, were the
subject of a case management hearing on August 13, 2020. NOL-40288-20 was an L2
Application based on an N12 Notice of Termination asserting that the Landlord
required possession of the rental unit for the purposes of residential
occupation for a period of at least 1-year. The termination date specified in
the N12 is June 30, 2020. The L2 also asserted a claim for wilful or negligent
undue damage.
 
6.    
Although the parties were unable to resolve the issues on
application, the parties’ agreed that the Landlord would do the following on or
before August 24, 2020: reactivate the garage door opener; reorganize their
belongings in the garage to ensure that the Tenant has access to 50% of the
total space; remove the stove from the yard; relocate the dryer under the stairs; cover the holes
in the walls (where light
fixtures were an option); remove or repair the wires in the
hallway; inspect the basement stove; and, inspect the storm door. If the application was to be amended, the Board in substance ordered
the Tenant to comply with the Board’s rules
respecting amendments by September 4, 2020.
 
7.    
The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on October
31, 2020.
 
8.    
The Landlord
withdrew the L2 Application on September 24, 2021.
 
9.    
The Tenant filed an
amended T2 Application on October 8, 2021 with a certificate of service confirming that the amended
T2 was given to the Landlord on October 1, 2021.
 
Request to Amend the T2 Application
 
10.  At the hearing
the Tenant requested an amendment of her application. I granted only some of the Tenant’s requested
amendments for the following reasons.
 
11.  First, the request to amend comes more than
1-year after the Board’s deadline of September 4, 2020. Second, the requested
amendments do not provide sufficient particulars for the Landlord
to know the case to be met. For example,
while the Tenant seeks to expand the grounds to
include illegal entry and substantial interference, the
Tenant’s particulars are as follows:
 
Landlord illegally entered unit and changed
locks without notice
on October 31, 2020 – before
I was moved out.
 
Landlord
harassed me, names called me, her and her family used my personal property. Unreasonable amount of home inspections, took pictures of unit without acknowledgement, had her family on
property drinking.
 
Apart from the
alleged illegal entry and change of locks on October 31, 2020, the above-
quoted particulars do not provide sufficient details (such as dates, times, and
a detailed description of the Landlord’s alleged
conduct) for the Landlord to know the case to be met and to respond.
 
12.  In the circumstances I allowed only the
following amendments. The Tenant’s T2 application is amended to include only the allegations that the Landlord
entered the unit




 
illegally and
changed the locks on October 31, 2020. I reach this conclusion because these alleged
incidents occurred after
the Board’s previous
deadline, which means
it was impossible for the
Tenant to comply with the Board’s previous order and because these allegations are sufficiently particularized for the Landlord to know the case to be met
and to respond. In my view, the Landlord had sufficient notice of these
allegations and permitting these amendments did not cause the Landlord any
prejudice.
 
T2 Application
 
Illegal Entry
 
13.  The rules respecting when and how a landlord
can enter a rental unit are found in
sections 25 through 27 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’).
 
14.  In short summary, a landlord may enter a
rental unit only in accordance with sections 26 and 27 of the Act. A landlord
is not required to give written notice in cases of emergency or if the tenant consents to the entry at the time of entry,
or, in circumstances that are not
applicable in this case, if the tenancy agreement requires the landlord to
clean the rental unit at regular intervals. Otherwise, a landlord is required
to give 24-hours written notice of entry between 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM for
certain defined purposes, and the written
 
15.  With respect to the alleged illegal entry
of October 31, 2020, I accepted the Tenant’s uncontested testimony to the effect that the Landlord
attended at the residential complex on October 31, 2020 at
approximately 6:35 p.m. while the Tenant was in the process of vacating the
rental unit. The Landlord entered the rental unit without obtaining the
Tenant’s
permission and changed the locks to the front door of the rental unit. The
Landlord did not provide the Tenant with a replacement key but instead left the
Tenant with access to the rental unit through an alternate door. As
there was no emergency, the Landlord’s entry into the rental unit without the Tenant’s permission on October 31, 2020
constitutes a breach of section 25 of the Act.
 
16.  As for the appropriate remedy, the illegal entry of a rental
unit is a breach of privacy. The leading case with respect to breach of
privacy is Wrona v. Toronto Community Housing Corporation, 2007 CanLII
3228 (ON SCDC). In that case the Tenant was provided with notice but the notice
failed to meet the mandatory requirements of the Act. The Court awarded the
tenant $1,000.00 for a single illegal entry. As Wrona is the leading
case, I am guided by Wrona in my determination as to the appropriate
amount to award the Tenant in this case.
 
17.  In the Wrona case there had been a
lengthy history of disputed notices of entry. The same can be said with respect
to this case, as the Tenant previously raised the issue of illegal entries and
the Landlord previously agreed to provide a proper written notice. The Tenant explained that the Landlord
informed her that she was no longer
bound to comply with the previous mediated
agreement or the Act because the Landlord issued an N12 notice of termination
and the Tenant did not vacate by the termination date specified in the notice.
This testimony was consistent with the Landlord’s July 2, 2020 text message to
the Tenant asserting that “the contract is now null and void” because the
termination date specified in the N12 had passed. The Landlord knew or ought to
have known that




 
this is
incorrect. In the circumstances, my
view is that it is appropriate to
award the Tenant a rent abatement of $900.00. The reason I find that the Tenant is entitled
to
$100.00 less
than the amount awarded in Wrona is because the Tenant was in the
process of moving out of the rental
unit such that the impact on her privacy was less than it would have been if all of the
Tenant’s belongings were still present in the rental unit.
 
Altered Locking System without Replacement Key
 
18.  Section 24 of the Act states:
 
24 A landlord
shall not alter the locking
system on a door giving entry to a rental unit or residential complex or
cause the locking system to be altered during the
tenant’s occupancy
of the rental unit without
giving the tenant
replacement keys.
 
As can be
seen, the door in question must be a door that gives entry to a rental unit or
residential complex. Further,
it is not the altering
of the locking system that is problematic but the failure to provide
replacement keys.
 
19.  The Tenant’s first allegation is that the Landlord altered
the locking system on the garage
door and did not provide her with a replacement key during the following
periods: November 15, 2018 to February 22, 2019; and, June 30, 2020 to August
24, 2020.
 
20.  Although I accept the Landlord’s conduct is
as the Tenant described, because she provided
uncontested testimony to this effect,
there was no evidence that the garage
door gave entry to the rental unit or the residential complex. As such, the Landlord’s
conduct is not a breach of section 24
of the Act. I cannot in any event consider the first period from November 15,
2018 to February 22, 2019 because of the 1-year limitation period in subsection
29(2) of the Act.
 
21.  That being said, I accept that the Tenant is legally unsophisticated and that the substance
of the Tenant’s pleadings clearly assert that the Landlord unilaterally reduced
or discontinued a service or facility, namely parking and related facilities as
well as storage facilities. Although the Tenant used the wrong
form, I accept the reasoning in TST-69731- 16 (Re),
2018 CanLII 140410 (ON LTB) that choosing the correct form is not
determinative. In the present case, there is no prejudice to the Landlord in
considering this claim under the rubric of section 130 of the Act, as both
parties to this proceeding participated in a case management hearing and have
treated this issue as justiciable.
 
22.  Section 130 of the Act provides:
 
130 (1) A
tenant of a rental unit may apply to the Board for an order for a reduction of the rent charged for
the rental unit due to a reduction or discontinuance in services or facilities provided
in respect of the rental
unit or the residential complex.
 
23.  The Tenant’s uncontested evidence was that she was entitled to use 50% of the garage
and that the Landlord deprived the Tenant of access to the garage between
November 15, 2018 and February 22, 2019
and June 30, 2020 to August 24, 2020. I accepted this evidence as true.




 
24.  The first period between November
15, 2018 and February 22, 2019 was the subject
of NOT-34398-18, which was finally resolved by the Board’s mediated
agreement. This application could have been
reopened but it was not. As a result, this period cannot be re-litigated. In
any event, consideration of this period is also barred by the 1-year limitation
period set out in subsection 130(5) of the Act.
 
25.  As for the appropriate remedy
for the period
between June 30, 2020 and August 24, 2020, subsection 39(3) of O. Reg.
516/06 provides:
 
(3)   If a service
or facility is discontinued and the discontinuance was not reasonable in the circumstances, the rent
shall be reduced by an amount that takes into account the following matters:
 
1.  
The value
of the service or facility, including the cost to
the tenant or former tenant of replacing the discontinued service or
facility.
 
2.  
The effect
of the discontinuance on the tenant or former tenant.
 
I quote this provision and not subsection 39(2) of the Regulation because
my view is that
the Landlord’s discontinuance of the Tenant’s access to the garage was not
reasonable in the circumstances. The Landlord’s decision to discontinue the
Tenant’s access to the garage was based on her false view that the previous and
still applicable mediated agreement between the parties was null and void because
the termination date specified
on the N12 had passed. The Landlord knew or ought to have known this was false.
 
26.  The Tenant’s position was that the Board
should award $1,200.00 per month for each month she was locked out of the
garage. This is equivalent to 100% of the rent, which is unreasonably high. In
circumstances where the
Tenant’s evidence was that the Landlord demanded the Tenant remove
her belongings from the garage,
which caused the Tenant
to cut a vacation short, and where the Landlord’s decision deprived the Tenant
and her household of access to and use of home and recreational equipment, my
finding is that the rent should be reduced
by $250.00 per month.
This amount reflects both the
value of the garage to the Tenant and
the effect of the discontinuance on the Tenant. The total amount awarded will
be $460.27: $250.00 per month x 12 months / 365 days x 56 days.
 
27.  The Tenant’s second
allegation is that the Landlord
altered the locking
system to the front
door of the rental unit on October 31, 2020 and did not provide the Tenant with
a replacement key. I accept that this occurred as described above. The
remaining issue is the appropriate remedy. In my view, a lump sum abatement of $100.00 is the appropriate remedy as
the Landlord’s breach of the Act only affected the Tenant for 1-day but did
interfere with her ability to move out of the rental unit.
 
T6 Application
 
28. 
Subsection 20(1) of the Act states:




 
20 (1) A
landlord is responsible for providing and from maintaining a residential
complex, including the rental units
in it, in a good state of repair and fit for habitation
and for complying with health, safety, housing and maintenance standards.
 
29.  The Tenant’s pleadings assert that the
Landlord: locked her out of the garage; failed to remove a metal stove from the
driveway; failed to repair a broken screen door; failed to repair the front door key pad; failed to properly address
a leak from the roof over the side
entrance to the rental unit; failed to repair
two open holes in the living room wall; failed
to address wires hanging at the side door entry way; and failed to fix
the basement stove. However, the Tenant’s pleadings only seek remedies with
respect the issues of being locked out of the garage, the Landlord’s alleged
failure to properly address a leak from the roof over the side entrance, the
Landlord’s alleged failure to remove the stove from the property and the
Landlord’s failure to repair the basement stove.
 
30.  The issue of being locked out of the garage
is not a maintenance issue or an issue with health, safety, housing and
maintenance standards. It has also already been addressed above. Although the
Tenant also sought to claim $1,200.00 for the Landlord’s breach of the previous
mediated agreement in NOT-34398-18, the appropriate course would have been for the Tenant
to re-open the application. I will therefore only consider the issues of the Landlord’s alleged failure to
properly address a leak from the roof over the side entrance, remove the stove
from the property and repair the basement stove.
 
Roof Leak
 
31.  The Tenant’s issue was not with the leak
itself but with the fact that when the Landlord sent people to address the leak
on March 12, 2020 they cleared ice from the roof and displaced huge blocks of
ice from the roof onto the driveway. The Tenant’s uncontested evidence was that
this blocked her access to the driveway, that the Landlord ought to have cleared
the driveway of the ice and that the Tenant
paid $100.00 to clear the ice left in the driveway by the Landlord’s
workers.
 
32.  I accept the Tenant’s uncontested evidence as true. The Landlord’s failure to maintain
the driveway constitutes a breach of section 20 of the Act. It is
appropriate to award the Tenant $100.00 for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
that the Tenant incurred.
 
Stove in Driveway
 
33. 
I accepted
the Tenant’s uncontested evidence to the effect that the Landlord
left a metal stove in the driveway from the beginning of the tenancy
in 2017 until the Landlord
finally removed it on August 12, 2020. This too is a breach of section
20 of the Act.
 
34.  As for the appropriate remedy, on March 20,
2020 the Government of Ontario made an emergency order under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act suspending
limitation periods and procedural time periods relevant to Board proceedings
retroactive to March 16, 2020. As the Tenant filed her application within the
period of suspension, the Tenant
would normally be entitled to a remedy retroactive to March 16, 2019. However,
the parties resolved NOT-34398-18
with an agreement that the Landlord would




 
remove the stove by April 30, 2019. The Tenant is therefore entitled
to a remedy from May 1,
2019 to August 12, 2020.
 
35.  The Tenant testified that the stove was in
the way but that it was not completely blocking access to the backyard. She
described the stove as more of an annoyance than a problem that had a
significant impact on her use of the residential complex. In these circumstances, it is appropriate to award a rent abatement of $25.00 per month. The total
amount awarded will be $386.30: $25.00 per month x 12 months / 365 days x 470
days.
 
Stove in Basement
 
36.  The Tenant testified that the basement stove was
working when she moved in but that it broke in November 2018. In
particular, both the oven and all but one of the elements as well as the oven
light stopped working. I accepted her uncontested evidence that the Tenant
reported this to the Landlord in November 2018 and that the Landlord did not
address the issue, including the Landlord’s failure
to inspect the stove
as required by the interim order
issued after the case management hearing on August 13, 2020.
 
37.  The Landlord’s failure
to fix the stove constitutes a breach of section 20 of the Act.
 
38.  As for the appropriate remedy, the Tenant
is entitled to a remedy retroactive
to March 16, 2019. On this issue, I accepted the Tenant’s uncontested evidence
to the broken stove made it more difficult for the Tenant
to cook for her family
and that this negatively affected her enjoyment of the rental unit.
This warrants a rent abatement of $50.00 per month for the period March 16,
2019 to October 31, 2020. The total amount awarded will be
$979.73: $50.00
per month x 12 months / 365 days x 596 days.
 
Administrative Fine
 
39. 
The Tenant requested that the Board impose an administrative fine.
 
40.  Administrative fines are discussed in Board
Interpretation Guideline 16, which states that the purpose of an administrative
fine is a remedy to be used by the Board to encourage compliance with the Act
and to deter landlords from engaging in similar activity in the future. Guideline
16 states that the remedy is not normally
imposed unless a landlord has shown a blatant regard
for the Act or other
remedies will not provide adequate
deterrence and compliance.
 
41.  Although the Landlord did in my view show a
blatant disregard for the Act, by discontinuing the Tenant’s access
to the garage and by failing to comply with the interim
order respecting the basement stove, the remedial provisions of the Act dealing
with these issues do not authorize the imposition of an administrative fine.
Although I could potentially impose an administrative fine for the Landlord’s
illegal entry on October 31, 2020 and the Landlord’s altering
of the locking system on the same date, my view is that
the remedies awarded will provide the Landlord with an adequate incentive to
comply with the Act in the future.
 
42.  The Tenant’s request
for an administrative fine is therefore denied.




 
Final Comments
 
43.  The total amount the Landlord will be
ordered to pay the Tenant for the Landlord’s breaches of the Act will be $2,926.30: $900 for the illegal entry on October
31, 2020;
$460.27 for
discontinuing access to the garage between June 30, 2020 and August 24, 2020;
$100.00 for altering the locking system to the front door without providing a
replacement key on October 31, 2020; $100.00 for reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses related to clearing
ice from the driveway; $386.30
for failing to remove the stove from the
driveway; and, $979.73 for failing to repair the basement stove.
 
44.  The Tenant also sought to raise the issue
of the Landlord’s failure to provide compensation for giving an N12 Notice of Termination under section 48 of the Act. This claim was not pleaded and was
therefore not considered.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord
shall pay to the Tenant
$2,926.30.
 
2.    
The Landlord
shall also pay to the Tenant $48.00
for the cost of filing
the T2 Application and $48.00 for the cost of filing the T6
Application.
 
3.    
The total
amount the Landlord
owes the Tenant
is $3,022.30.
 
4.    
The Landlord
shall pay the Tenant
the full amount owing by January 17, 2022.
 
5.    
If the Landlord does
not pay the Tenant the full amount owing by January 17, 2022, the Landlord will owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from January
18, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
The Tenant has the right, at any time, to collect
the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
