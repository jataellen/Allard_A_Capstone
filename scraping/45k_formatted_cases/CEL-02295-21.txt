Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-02295-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


517 WILDGRASS ROAD
  MISSISSAUGA ON L5B4H8


 




Between:


Rohan Sharma


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Allan Ramos Karoline Slobada Maribis Duran
Perez
Neol Dalgado Castillo


Tenants



 
 
 
Rohan Sharma
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Maribis Duran Perez, Allan Ramos, Karoline
Slobada and Neol Dalgado Castillo
(the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent
that the Tenants owe.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on November 29, 2021. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Jasleen
Narula, attended the hearing. As of 2:34 p.m., the Tenants were not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from August
1, 2021 to November 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective August 22, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful
monthly rent is $3,000.00.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $6,000.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from April
6, 2021 to August 22, 2021.




 
7.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the parties and whether
the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 15, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$9,482.63*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 4, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $98.63 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 5, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing*
on or before January 15,
2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 16,
2022 at .00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 16, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 15, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $18,186.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
16, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
