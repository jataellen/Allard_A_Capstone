Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-18584-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


3503, 100 MAIN STREET
EAST HAMILTON ON L8N3W7


 




Between:


Interrent c/o
CLV Group


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Ugochukwu Uwalaka


Tenant



 
 
 
Interrent c/o CLV Group (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Ugochukwu Uwalaka (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that
the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 27, 2022.
 
Only the
Landlord's Legal Representative, Daniel Abraham, attended the hearing. As of
9:28 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.        
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
October 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination
effective November 25, 2020.
 
2.        
The monthly rent was $1,225.00; it increased to $1,239.70 on January 1, 2022.
 
3.        
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,239.91 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
4.        
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from September 21, 2020 to November 25, 2020.
 
5.        
The Tenant paid $12,125.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.        
To the date of hearing the Tenant owes $5,225.70 comprised
of arrears ($5,039.70) and the application filing fee ($186.00).
 
7.        
 The Landlord's Legal Representative submitted that the Landlord is seeking the standard
11-day voidable order as the amount owing is
still approximately double what the amount




File Number: SOL-18584-20
 
was when the application was filed. Further,
the Landlord reached
out ot the Tenant with respect to a repayment plan, and
apart from a lump sum received in November 2021, there has been no other
payments.
 
8.        
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenant was not present to submit ant consideration for delaying or denying the eviction under
section 83, and the
Landlord's Legal Representative was not aware of any such considerations.
 
9.        
This order contains all the reasons
for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.        
Unless the Tenant voids the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 5, 2022.
 
2.        
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $7,144.59*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
22, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.        
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$40.27 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 23, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.        
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.        
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March 5, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from March 6, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.        
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 5, 2022, then starting March 6, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.        
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 6, 2022.
8.        
If the Tenant wishes to
void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
-$3,223.25 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022,
or
ii)             
-$1,997.20 if the payment
is made on or before
March 5, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.




File Number: SOL-18584-20
 
9.        
The Tenant may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after March
6, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
