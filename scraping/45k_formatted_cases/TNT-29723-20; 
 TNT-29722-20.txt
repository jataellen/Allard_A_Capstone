Gurdip Sahota


Landlord



 
 
Manish Kumar
(the 'Tenant') applied for an order determining that Gurdip Sahota (the
'Landlord') failed to meet the Landlord's maintenance obligations under the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') or failed to comply with health, safety,
housing or maintenance standards; and for an order determining that the
Landlord or the Landlord's superintendent/agent harassed, obstructed, coerced,
threatened or interfered with the Tenant, entered the rental unit illegally and substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenant or
by a member of the Tenant's household.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 12, 2021.
The Tenant and the Landlord’s agent A. Sahota attended the hearing.
Matters # TNT-29723-20 and # TNT-29722-20 relate to the same property
and parties and on
consent they were heard together.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
The Tenant brought a T6 Application, pursuant to s.29(1) Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
(the ‘Act’), which alleges the Landlord has breached an obligation under
s.20(1):
 
A landlord is responsible for
providing and maintaining a residential complex, including the rental units in it, in a good state of repair and fit for
habitation and for complying with health, safety, housing and maintenance
standards
 
2.    In addition to the T6 Application, the Tenant brought
a T2 Application pursuant to s.29(1) of
the Act, which alleges the Landlord or the
Landlord's superintendent/agent entered the unit illegally,
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or
residential complex by the Tenant or by a member of his household, and harassed,
obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with the Tenant




 
T6 Application Pest Issues
1.    The Tenant alleges that silverfish and other bugs have
infested the unit since September 19, 2019, but admitted the problem was fixed
in October 2020. The Tenant produced
some pictures and 4 videos, each picture/video showing one insect. The Tenant also submitted that the insects
have impacted his health since he is allergic and gets rashes. No medical documentation was submitted in
support of the alleged impact on his health.
 
2.    The Landlord submits that pest treatments were applied in 2019 and 2020; that the issue is
resolved; and, that there was never widespread infestation of bugs at the unit.
 
3.    The Tenant only produced one text communication with
the Landlord whereby in the midst of raising a different issue with the
Landlord, the Tenant additionally adds: “Please do something for bugs…they
are a lot now”. Given the
evidence before me and the lack of communication between the Tenant and the
Landlord about this issue, I do not find that there was widespread infestation
of bugs, and I find that the Landlord acted reasonably in the circumstances.
 
Electrical outlets
 
4.    The Tenant alleges there were seven electrical outlets
exposed, which posed a safety risk to the Tenant due to the lack of protective
coverings and exposed wires. The Tenant indicated he thinks he told the
Landlord sometime in 2017 and that the problem was only fixed in October 2020. The Tenant also advised that his then
legal counsel notified the Landlord of the issue on March 3, 2020, and thus
gave the Landlord formal notice at that time.
The Tenant submitted into evidence a letter written from his legal
counsel, dated March 3, 2020.
 
5.    Based upon the evidence presented, I find the Landlord
was made aware of this concern in
March 2020 and that this issue presented minimal disruption to the Tenant’s
ability to normally reside in the unit for
the period of time from March 2020 through
to October 2020. I find an abatement
of $280, being approximately 5% of rent to be appropriate.
 
Paint on Walls/Hole
 
6.    The Tenant alleges there are walls that have not been
painted properly and produced six pictures showing some light staining. The Landlord submitted that the rental
unit was painted prior to the Tenant’s move in; that the staining damage is
caused by the Tenant’s oil lamp; and, that the unit was recently painted in
August 2019. In this regard, the
Landlord produced a text message to the Tenant on August 17, 2019 stating, “Can
we come to paint the basement tomorrow morning?”, to which the Tenant
replied: “Yes you can.” The
Tenant presented essentially no evidence that this issue has caused any
disruption to the Tenant’s ability to normally reside in the unit.
 
7.    Based upon the limited evidence before me, I do not
find that the Tenant has proven on a balance of probabilities that the Landlord
breached his obligations under s.20(1).




 
T2 Application Illegal entry
8.    The Tenant alleges the Landlord illegally entered the
unit “lots of times” and produced text messages between the parties, discussing
when the Landlord could come to the rental unit. The Tenant also described an incident of January 9, 2020 whereby
the Landlord’s agent came unannounced while the Tenant was in the washroom,
rang the doorbell several times and finally, the Tenant allowed the Landlord’s
agent in the unit.
 
9.    The Landlord’s agent added the Landlord was trying to
assist the Tenant in finding a roommate and in any event, stated that consent
was requested in advance. While it is
certainly preferable that the Landlord provide reasonable advance notice prior
to requesting entry, section 26(1) of the Act provides that a landlord may
enter a rental unit without written notice if the tenant consents to the entry
at the time of entry. I find that
this is what happened here.
 
Persistent calls/texts
 
10. The Tenant alleges the Landlord persistently calls/texts the Landlord. The Tenant testified that the Landlord keeps trying to call/text him at work and that the large volume of attempts
constitutes harassment. The Landlord’s agent submits there have only been 28
text messages with the Landlord over the course of the year. Upon review of the text messages
presented, the Landlord’s responses appear to be balanced and respectful. I do
not find on a balance of probabilities that the Landlord’s communications with
the Tenant constitute harassment.
 
Eviction notices
 
11. The Tenant alleges the Landlord used
abusive/threatening language while visiting the rental unit and has served the
Tenant with six (6) Form N4 notices of termination from June 2020 through to January 2021.  The Tenant also testified that the Landlord has served him with
a Form N12 notice of termination for purchaser’s own use in March 2020.
 
12. The Tenant has admitted to falling behind in rent
payments. For three (3) of the Form
N4 notices, the Tenant was alleged to have not paid anything. For the remaining three (3) Form N4
notices, the Tenant had paid at least some rent, but the Landlord alleges it
was not the full amount. In this regard, both parties testified as to a dispute
over the proper legal rent.  As a determination order the legality of
the rent is not before me, it appears that this area of contention has
contributed to three (3) of the Form N4 notices served by the Landlord.  While the Landlord is certainly entitled
to assert its rights under the Act, I find on a balance of probabilities that
the final three (3) Form N4 notices were excessive, considering the Landlord
has not filed the appropriate paperwork to have the issue adjudicated and there
were a total of six (6) Form N4 notices of termination over an 8 month period.
 
13. I find there was minimal disruption to the Tenant’s ability to normally
reside in the unit for the following 3 months where the most recent three (3) Form N4 notices
were given:




 
September 2020, October 2020 and January
2021. I find an abatement
of $105, being approximately 5% of rent to be
appropriate.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlords shall pay to the Tenant the sum of
$385.00.
 
2.    
The Landlords shall also pay to the Tenant $101.00 for the cost of filing
the applications.
 
3.    
The total amount the Landlords owe to the Tenant is $486.00.
 
4.    
If the Landlords do not pay the Tenant the full amount owing
by February 18, 2022,
the Landlords will owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated
from February 18, 2022at 2.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
 
5.    
The Tenant has the right, at any time,
to collect the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
