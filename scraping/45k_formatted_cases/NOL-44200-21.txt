Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44200-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


APT 4, 228 WILSON STREET THUNDER BAY ON P7B1M8


 




Between:


Lyndon Agombar


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Katrina Mitas


Tenant



 
 
 
Lyndon Agombar (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Katrina Mitas (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant or another occupant of the rental unit has
committed an illegal act or has carried out, or permitted someone to carry out
an illegal trade, business or occupation in the rental unit or the
residential complex involving the production of an illegal drug, the trafficking in an illegal
drug or the possession of an illegal
drug for the purposes of trafficking.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the
unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 988 4914 7021# on February
7, 2022. Only the
Landlord attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has been arrested and charged with trafficking. The Tenant’s unit was under surveillance by the police due to
information about drug activity. On
May 19, 2021, the police found in the Tenant’s unit 223 grams of cocaine, 18
grams of pentanal, 70 grams of crack cocaine, and 30 grams of methamphetamine.
 
2.     The Tenant was released on bail. Police patrol the residential complex
and on July 23, 2021 found
the Tenant passed out in his unit and in possession of drug paraphernalia. The
Tenant was again charged.
 
3.     The Tenant and his guests had been using a shed on the
property for drug use. The Landlord testified
that they have burned the shed down due to their activities in the shed.
 
4.     I find the Tenant has committed an illegal act involving the possession of an illegal
drug for the purposes of trafficking in the rental unit.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $750.00
from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.




 
 
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from October 16, 2021 to
October 14, 2021
 
7.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of February
14, 2021. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 14, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$2,159.88, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from October 15, 2021
to February 9, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $24.66 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from February 10, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
February 14, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 15, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 14, 2022, then starting February
15, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after
February 15, 2022. The Sheriff
is requested to expedite the enforcement of this order.
