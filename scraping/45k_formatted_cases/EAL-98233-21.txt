Robert J Harvey


Tenant



 
 
 
Gary H Breyer (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Robert
J Harvey (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 1, 2022. Only the Landlord attended the hearing. As of 10:20 a.m.,
the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the
Tenant was required to pay for the period from July
1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective September
18, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on
October 31, 2021. The Tenant
was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was
filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $850.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $850.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of October
31, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$2,400.00*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to October 31, 2021, less the rent deposit.




File Number: EAL-98233-21
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before
February 22, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 23, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
