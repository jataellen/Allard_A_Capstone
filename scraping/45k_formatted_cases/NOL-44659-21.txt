In the matter
of:


1038 BEATRICE CRESCENT SUDBURY ON P3A3E5


 




Between:


Native People Of Sudbury


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Justin
Chum


Tenant



 
 
 
Native People
Of Sudbury (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Justin Chum (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the
Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified
in the mediated settlement issued by the Board on December 9, 2021 with respect
to application NOL-43737-21.
 
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.    
The mediated settlement
provided that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the
Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the settlement.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the settlement: The Tenant did not pay $287 arrears on or
before December 21, 2021.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent.
The resulting mediated settlement required the Tenant to pay rent or some
or all of the arrears
of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request
an order for the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.    
The amount that is
still owing, according to the terms of the mediated settlement, for arrears of rent, and the costs related to the application fee for the previous application is
$1,697.00.
 
5.    
Since the date of the mediated
settlement, the Tenant
has failed to pay the full rent that
became owing for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.

between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 28, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,857.41*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 17, 2022 and the

3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $9.44
per day for compensation for the use of

the full amount
owing* on or before January
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.

of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 29, 2022.

The tenant has until January 27, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 27, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
