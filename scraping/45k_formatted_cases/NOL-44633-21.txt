In the matter
of:


207B, 60 WEST STREET BLIND RIVER ON P0R1B0


 




Between:


60 West St. Real Estate
Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


John W. Berthelot Kelly M. Carter


Tenants



 
 
 
60 West St. Real
Estate Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict John W. Berthelot and Kelly M. Carter (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants
pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the Board on August 12, 2021 with respect to application
NOL-42337-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenants have not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The
Tenant did not pay $ 1300.00 rent on or before November 1, 2021.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order
required the Tenants
to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenants
were ordered to pay $22,355.50 for rent arrears
and the costs
related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
NOL-42337-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $17,555.50 and
that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order
NOL-42337-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenants
have failed to pay the full rent that became owing.




File Number: NOL-44633-21
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Order NOL-42337-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 25, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$20,753.86*. (Less any amount
paid since the date
the application was filed)This amount represents the rent owing up to January
14, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the previous
application.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $42.74
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 15, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
25, 2022, the Tenants will start
to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from
January 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 25, 2022, then starting January
26, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 26, 2022.
