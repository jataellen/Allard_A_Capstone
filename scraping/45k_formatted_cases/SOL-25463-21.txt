Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-25463-21
 



In the matter
of:


133 OAKDALE AVENUE
ST. CATHARINES ON L2P2L3


 




Between:


Timothy Bush


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Alisha Schapoks


Tenant



 
 
 
Timothy Bush (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Alisha Schapoks (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 1, 2022. Only
the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Adam Ostermeier, attended the hearing. As
of 2:11 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from October 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective October 18, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $2,500.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $2,500.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from August 31, 2021 to October 18, 2021.
 
7.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.




 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 19, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $8,266.59*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
8, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $82.19
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 9, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
19, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 20, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 19, 2022, then starting
February 20, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 20, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 19, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $12,686.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain
in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 20, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period
of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
