$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February
20, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 21, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 20, 2022, then starting
February 21, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
