Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kemore Morley


Tenant



 
 
 
Toronto Community Housing Corporation
(the 'Landlord') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kemore
Morley (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the mediated
settlement issued by the Board on January 30, 2020 with respect to application
TEL-01067-19.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The mediated settlement provided that the Landlord
could apply to the Board under section 78 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act') without
notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet
certain condition(s) specified in the settlement.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant
has not met the following condition specified in the settlement:
The Tenant failed to pay $150.00 towards the arrears, on or before December 25,
2021.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 20, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 20, 2022, then starting
February 21, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 21, 2022.
