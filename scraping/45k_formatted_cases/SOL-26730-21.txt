William Puchalski


Tenant



 
 
 
RWC Management (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict William Puchalski (the 'Tenant') and for
an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the mediated settlement issued by the
Board on August 31, 2021 with respect to application SOL-22350-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The mediated settlement provided that the Landlord
could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the
Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the settlement.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following condition
specified in the settlement: the Tenant did not pay the lawful rent for
December on or before December 1, 2021.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting mediated settlement required
the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of
the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request
an order for the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.    
The amount that is still owing,
according to the terms of the mediated
settlement, for arrears of
rent, is $2,586.00.
 
5.     Since the date of the mediated settlement, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that
became owing for the period from September 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.
 
6.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,000.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.




File Number: SOL-26730-21
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from October 16, 2020 to
January 17, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The previous order
SOL-22350-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 28, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,785.01*. This
amount represents the rent owing up to December
31, 2021 less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $32.88 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
January 28, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
January 29, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 29, 2022.

The tenant has until January 27, 2022 to file a motion with the Board

and the Board will schedule a hearing.
