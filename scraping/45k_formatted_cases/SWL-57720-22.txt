Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57720-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


53 CANAL STREET TILBURY ON N0P2L0


 




Between:


Adam Wissink


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Daniel Ritchie
  Demi Cabral


Tenants



 
 
 
On February 8, 2022, Adam Wissink (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Daniel
Ritchie and Demi Cabral (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants
pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the Board on February 2, 2022 with respect to
application LTB-L-000479-22.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants
have not met the following
condition specified in the order: The Tenants did not pay $2800.00 rent
on or before February 7, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $5,786.00 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
LTB-L-000479-22. The amount that is still owing from that order is $5,786.00
and that amount is included
in this order. As a result,
the previous order
LTB-L-000479-22 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from February 1, 2022 to February 28, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:




File Number: SWL-57720-22
 
 
 
1.    
Order LTB-L-000479-22 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before March 6, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $7,903.26*. This amount represents the rent owing up to February 23, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$92.05 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 24,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before March 6, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 7, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 6, 2022, then starting
March 7, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 7, 2022.
