Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-21188-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


408, 349 MARLAND
AVENUE OSHAWA ON L1J1X4


 




Between:


Camsta (#1) Limited Partnership


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Nichole
Munro Trevor Potts


Tenants



 
 
 
Camsta (#1) Limited Partnership (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Nichole Munro and Trevor Potts (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the
rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the
order issued by the Board on October 6, 2021 with respect to application
TEL-15767-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenants
have not met the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenants failed
to pay the lawful monthly
rent in full on or before November
1, 2021. The Tenants failed
to pay $370.00 towards the arrears on or before November 15, 2021.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order
required the Tenants
to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenants were
ordered to pay $4,433.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the
Landlord's application fee in Order
TEL-15767-21. The amount
that is still owing from that
order is $4,433.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order TEL-15767-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenants
have failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from October 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.




 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,404.53 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
1, 2021 to January 12, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TEL-15767-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants
must move out of the rental unit on or before January 23, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord $6,462.19*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 12, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $46.85
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 13, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
23, 2022, the Tenants will start
to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from
January 24, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 23, 2022, then starting January
24, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 24, 2022.
