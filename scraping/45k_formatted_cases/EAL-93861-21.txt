In the matter
of:


 
2479 CLEROUX CRESCENT OTTAWA ON K1W1A1


 




Between:


Laurine Rehel


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Joseph
  Renaud


Tenant



 
 
 
Laurine Rehel
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Joseph
Renaud (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on November 17, 2021.
 
The Landlord,
Landlord's Legal Representative, Allan Kouri, the Tenant and the Tenant's
Legal Representative, Kaitlin Brennan, attended the hearing. Theresa
Galdamez (‘TG’) attended the hearing as a witness for the Landlord.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord
in good faith requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
2.    
The test of good faith
is genuine intention to occupy the residential unit and not the reasonableness
of the landlord’s proposal (Feeney v. Noble (1994), 19, O.R. (3d) (Div.
Ct.) (“Feeney”). As confirmed in subsequent decisions, this legal test remains unchanged and the “good faith”
requirement simply means a genuine intention to occupy the premises and not the
reasonableness of the landlord’s proposal (Salter v. Beljinac 2001
CanLII 30231 (ONSC DC) (“Salter”).
 
3.    
The Landlord testified
that she was living with her mother in the house that her mother owned. After
the passing of her mother on December 17, 2020, the home was sold to settle the estate. The sale was completed on November 1, 2021. The Landlord moved in
with her niece where she is currently residing since October 30, 2021. The
Landlord testified that she is currently sleeping on her niece’s couch. She is
74 years old and wishes to move into the residential unit for the purpose of
residential occupation.




 
4.    
The Tenant submits that
the notice was given in bad faith because there is a history of the Landlord
attempting to terminate the tenancy. The Tenant submits that the Landlord
attempted to evict the Tenant in 2017 so that her nephew could move in. However,
the Tenant refused to move out. The Tenant alleges that the Landlord
brings this application to evict in retaliation
because the Tenant refused to move out. Additionally, the Tenant submits that this is a 25-year tenancy
where the Tenant is paying below market rent and the Landlord intends to re-rent the rental unit at a higher
price once the Tenant moves out.
 
5.    
I do not find that the Landlord served the notice
in retaliation because
the Tenant refused to leave so that the Landlord’s
nephew could move in. I say this because the incident occurred in 2017,
whereas, the Tenant was served the N12 notice in January 2021. The timing of
the incident is too far removed from the current application. With respect to
the claim that the Landlord is motivated by the potential of collecting more
rent for the rental unit, there is insufficient evidence to establish that this
is the reason for terminating the tenancy.
 
6.    
In this case, the
Landlord is currently dislocated from the home she used to live in with her
late mother. She is living with her niece, sleeping on the couch. The Landlord
does not own other properties and
has nowhere else to go. Under these circumstances, I am satisfied that the
Landlord genuinely intends to occupy
the rental unit for the purpose of
residential occupation. Therefore, I find that the Landlord
has satisfied the test for “good
faith” as per the Feeney and Salter decisions above.
 
7.    
The Landlord
paid the Tenants
compensation equal to one month's
rent before the termination date in the notice of
termination.
 
8.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
9.    
The Tenant requested an additional 6 months
to move. The Tenant testified that he is on a fixed
income, suffers from health issues and is unable to work. He has lived in the
unit for 25 years. However, the Tenant has known for approximately 11 months
that the Landlord intends to occupy the rental unit and the length of the proceedings has afforded him
time to explore his options. The Landlord has already suffered dislocation.
Since October 30, 2021,
the Landlord has been residing
with her niece. Balancing the interests
and circumstances of the parties and considering that the enforcement of the
order may take some time, it would be unfair to delay the eviction (Peel
Non-Profit Housing v. McNamara, [1990] O.J. No.364).
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
January 16, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 16, 2022.




 
2.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$25.10 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from January 6, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before January
16, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January
17, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 17, 2022.
