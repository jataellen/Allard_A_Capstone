Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-35725-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


233 AHMADIYYA AVENUE MAPLE ON L6A3A6


 




Between:


Mubashir Sahi


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Ani Lazarus Oluanyi


Tenant



 
 
 
Mubashir Sahi (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ani Lazarus
Oluanyi (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying
the Tenant's rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on February
17, 2022. The Landlord,
represented by Madhuri Azad, and the Tenant, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has been persistently late paying rent.
 
2.     A dispute arose about the use of the last month rent
deposit. The Tenant agrees he is
required to pay this back to the Landlord and that he must pay is rent in full and on time
going forward.
 
3.    
The Tenant has lived in the unit
for just over five years and the late payments are attributed to the last month rent deposit dispute.
I find relief from eviction
is reasonable under the
circumstances. This order reflects
the terms for relief that was stated at the hearing.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord the lawful rent
in full and on time for each consecutive month commencing March 2022 and continuing through
February 2023.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$700.00 to replace
the last month rent deposit
on or before April 30, 2022.

3.    
In the event the
Tenant fails to make the above said payment in full and on time, the Landlord
shall be entitled to apply to the Board, no later than 30 days after a breach
of this Order, without
notice to the Tenant, for an Order terminating the tenancy and evicting
the Tenant, pursuant to Section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of the application.
 
5.     The Landlord has the right to collect
the amount ordered
at any time.
 
6.    
If the Tenant
does not pay the full amount owing in full amount owing by March 1, 2022 the Tenant
will owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from March 2, 2022 at
2% annually on the outstanding balance.
