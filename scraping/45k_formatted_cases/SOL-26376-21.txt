and


 




 


David Leatham (senior) DJ Leatham


Tenants



 
 
Peter Kouretsos (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order requiring DJ Leatham and David Leatham (senior) (the 'Tenants') to pay compensation for the money they should have paid had they not misrepresented their income or the
income of a member of their family
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 2, 2022.
 
Only Irene Kosmos, on behalf of
the Landlord, attended the hearing. As of 10:12 a.m., the Tenants were not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord’s L2 application sought termination of
the tenancy based on the Tenants dismissal as building
superintendents. For the reasons that follow, termination is granted.
 
2.     The Tenants was still in possession of the rental
unit as of the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The Landlord’s Agent testified that the
superintendent’s employment terminated on October 30, 2021. The following were entered into evidence: letter
dated November 15, 2021confirming employment termination;
the employment contract; and, a letter dated December 1, 2021 requiring
$1,000.00 monthly compensation.
 
4.    
The Landlord’s Agent also testified that the Tenants
advised that they were in the process of vacating. With respect to
compensation, the Tenants paid $1,000.00 for December but did not pay anything
else.
 
5.     Pursuant to section
93(3) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’), the Tenants
are not responsible for rent from October 31, 2021 through November 6, 2021.

6.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenants advised the Landlord that
they were in the process of moving out.
 
7.     This order contains
all the reasons
for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated
February 19, 2022. The Tenants
must move out of the rental
unit on or before February 19, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $1,986.40 which
represents the amount of compensation owing for November 7 through 30, 2021, January
2022, and per-diem February 2022 to the date of this
order.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay the Landlord $32.88 per-diem from February 9, 2022 to the date they vacate.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February 19, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 20, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 19, 2022, then starting
February 20, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 20, 2022.
