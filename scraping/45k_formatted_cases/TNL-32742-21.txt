Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-32742-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


175 ELMWOOD AVENUE RICHMOND HILL ON L4C1L2


 




Between:


Ben
  Mehdizadeh


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Farzad Esmizadeh


Tenant



 
 
 
Ben Mehdizadeh (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Farzad Esmizadeh (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on September 3, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord attended the
hearing. As of 11:10 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing,
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
April 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective April 30,
2021.
 
2.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,100.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
3.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from March 10, 2018 to April 30, 2021.
 
4.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. Based on the uncontested evidence
provided by the Landlord at the hearing, I find that the Tenant failed to pay
his rent in full. I have no reason to deny the eviction requested by the
Landlord.
 
It is ordered that:




File Number: TNL-32742-21
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 4, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $24,922.54*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 24, 2022,
less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $82.19
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 25, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
4, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 5, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 4, 2022, then starting
February 5, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 5, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$25,186.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$27,686.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 4, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act
to set aside this order if they pay
the amount required under that subsection on or after February 5, 2022 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
