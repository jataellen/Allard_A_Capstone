Order under Section 77(8)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-36090-21-SA
 
 



In the matter
of:


198 YORK
MILLS ROAD TORONTO ON
  M2L1K9


 




Between:


Ronghua Zhang


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jae-hoon Cho Moon
Jung Choi


Tenants



 
 
Ronghua Zhang (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Moon Jung Choi and Jae-hoon
Cho (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
entered into an agreement to terminate the tenancy. That
application was resolved by order TNL-36090-21 issued on December 10, 2021.
 
The Tenants filed a motion to set aside order TNL-36090-21.
 
This motion
was scheduled by videoconference on February 3, 2022.
Neither the Landlord nor the Tenants attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Board’s records show the first-named Tenant e-mailed to the Board on January
30, 2022, requesting to “cancel the motion to set aside an ex parte
order” hearing. In that email, a letter was attached
indicating that the Tenants have “…decided to move before February 29 [sic] 2022 and have
safely secured another rental property.” the Tenants sought to cancel the
hearing. This letter was signed by both Tenants.
 
2.     The Board’s records show that the Landlord’s
representative, Rong Wei Yu, wrote to the Tenants on the same day and cc’d the Board seeking
confirmation that the Tenants have decided to withdraw their motion to
set aside the order and indicating that if that was the case, the Landlord
would not be appearing at the hearing either.
 
3.    
The Board’s records further
show the Tenants’
response to the Landlord’s query
the same day confirming that they will not be
attending the hearing as they consider the matter closed.
 
4.    
Based on the above,
I take it to mean the Tenants’
sought to withdraw
their motion to set
aside the eviction order. The Landlord does not appear to object.
