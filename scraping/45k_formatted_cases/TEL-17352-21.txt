Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-17352-21
TEL-17353-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


108 &
406, 20 SEWELLS
ROAD SCARBOROUGH ON M1B3G5


 




Between:


Wigwamen Incorporated


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jason Mcleod


Tenant



 
 
 
Wigwamen Incorporated (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jason Mcleod (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant,
another occupant of the rental
unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 913 5165 7618#
on August 10, 2021. The Landlord’s
Property Manager, Milroy Hoosein, testified at the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord made two applications for two different
units in the same residential complex for the same named
tenant. Both applications were heard together
and this order addresses both
rental units.
 
2.    
The Landlord is concerned about
cameras the Tenant has outside of unit 108. The
are no cameras outside unit 406. The Tenants
has what he describes as security cameras
at the front door in the
hallway of his floor in the rental complex, as
well at the rear entrance to the unit.
 
3.     The Landlord’s concern
is that the Tenant can gather video images and share them. The
Tenant testified that he does not share the images on a public platform. He has shared images with the police to
help them identify an assault victim’s attacker, as well as on a private
platform with one of the staff for security reasons where only that person
could view the video.
 
4.    
The Landlord submits that they have had a complaint from one
tenant who said they feel uncomfortable being video taped. The Landlord
also submits that they have 64 cameras in the residential complex. 22 high definition and 42 analog.

5.     The Landlord also points to the lease where is states that the Tenants
are not permitted to have satellite dishes, radio or TV antennas outside
their units.
 
6.     The question to be answered
is whether the presence of the cameras
cause substantial interference
with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlord or another tenant.
 
7.     The evidence before me is that there is one tenant who
is not comfortable with the presence of the camera in the hallway. The Landlord has not demonstrated how the
presence of the camera has substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord. There is no evidence the Tenant is sharing
any of the images publicly or in any way that might invade privacy. I cannot find that the presence of the cameras
has met the test of substantial interference at this time.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord's application is dismissed.
