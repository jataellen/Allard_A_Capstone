Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19275-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


4, 1145 MIDLAND AVENUE SCARBOROUGH ON M1K4H2


 




Between:


Midland Homes
Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Robert Kelly Tina
Tanzola


Tenants



 
 
 
Midland Homes Inc (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tina
Tanzola and Robert Kelly (the 'Tenants') because
they have been persistently late in paying
their rent.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 11, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord’s legal representative, D. Schofield, attended
the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants did not attend
the hearing scheduled for 9 a.m. I waited
over an hour and
then I proceeded to hear the matter on an uncontested basis.
 
2.    
The Landlord alleged on the N8 notice of termination, that the Tenants
had paid the rent
late in five months in 2020, and six months in 2021.
 
3.     The Landlord’s legal
representative said that the Tenants
have not paid the last two
month’s rent, and they now owe over $2,700.00 in arrears.
 
4.     The Landlord submits that the tenancy should be
terminated because the Landlord has continuously had to bring
applications before the Board in order to ensure that the rent is
paid. The Landlord’s legal
representative said that the Tenants only recently discontinued an application
for arrears of rent, and now the Landlord has had to come before the Board for
the persistent late application. Consequently,
he said that it is prejudicial to the Landlord for the tenancy to continue.
 
5.     I find, on the uncontested evidence of the Landlord that the tenancy
is no longer viable, for the following
reasons. The Landlord had to file
a rent arrears application in order
to

receive previous arrears of rent,
which were only paid up in December, 2021. The
Tenants then immediately went into arrears, and they now owe over $2,700.00 in arrears.
The Tenants did not attend the hearing to request a continuation of the
tenancy, nor to enter into discussions with the Landlord about paying the
arrears or paying the rent on time, going forward. Clearly, the repeated notices of termination have not corrected
the Tenants’ behaviour. They have
also been persistently late in paying the rent for at least two years.
 
6.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
above in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would
be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated, as of February
6, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 6, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenants do not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing on or before February 6, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 7, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 6, 2022, then starting February
7, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
5.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 7, 2022.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on August 7, 2022 if the order
has not been filed on or before
this date with the
Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
