Windsor Essex Community Housing
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Carine Mbuyi (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 6, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s
Legal Representative, Cameron Parrott, attended the hearing. As of 10:01 a.m.,
the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing

with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
It is determined that:

The Tenant has not paid $5,723.00
of the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from January 1, 2020 to
September 30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective August 13, 2022.

The Tenant
is in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $644.00.

finalize the agreement. The Landlord’s Legal Representative asked to have the payment plan ordered by the Board instead
of having the Tenant face eviction.
 
8.    
I agreed to have the payment
plan presented by the Landlord’s Legal Representative
settle this matter before the Board.
 
9.     This order contains
all of the reasons in this matter
and no further reasons will be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant shall pay the Landlord
$3,981.00, which represents the arrears of rent and costs outstanding for the period
ending January 31, 2022.
 
2.     The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant is denied
on the condition that:
 
(a)  The Tenant shall pay installments of $400.00 on
or before the 1st of the month
for the nine (9) month period
commencing February 1, 2022 to October 1, 2022.
 
(b)  The remaining balance
of $381.00 shall be paid on or before
November 1, 2022.
 
(c)  The Tenant shall pay the Landlord the monthly rent for the months of February 2022 to November 2022 in full and by the first
day of each corresponding month.
 
3.    
If the Tenant fails
to make any of the payments in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates required then:
 
(a)  The Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”) for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant and for the payment of any new arrears of rent and NSF charges
not already ordered under paragraph 1 of this order. The Landlord must make the
application within 30 days of a breach of a condition set out in paragraph 2 of
this order.
 
(b)  The balance owing under paragraph
1 of this order shall become payable
on the day following the date of default. The monies owing shall bear
interest at the post-judgment interest rate determined under subsection 207(7)
of the Act.
