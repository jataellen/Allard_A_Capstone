In the matter
of:


1 AND 2, 501 PALMERSTON BOULEVARD TORONTO ON M6G2P2


 




Between:


Attila Kis Csilla

Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Susan M. Wright


Tenant



 
Attila Kis and Csilla Kis (the
'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Susan M.
Wright (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord has entered into an agreement of
purchase and sale of the rental
unit and the purchaser requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 16, 2021.
 
The Landlords and the Tenant attended
the hearing. The Tenant was represented by Jane
Ferguson and Frankie Dash.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
By way of background, the
Landlords’ L2 application is based on a N12 notice of termination served to the Tenant on July 30, 2021 with a termination date of September 30, 2021 pursuant to subsection
49(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006.
 
PRELIMINARY ISSUE
 
2.     At the beginning
of the hearing, a preliminary issue was raised
by the Tenant with respect to the validity of the N12 notice of termination; specifically, that the residential complex, at the time
the N12 was served, consisted of six rental units, which renders the N12
invalid and the Landlord’s application should be dismissed.
 
3.     The Tenant’s evidence was the Tenant has resided in
the rental unit for over twenty years. During her tenancy, while the properties
were physically two separate buildings with three units in each building, they
functioned as one residential complex. Both buildings shared the backyard
and parking facilities. Both buildings were on one parcel of land. They shared waste management and
collection services. They were owned by Louis Vass who became deceased and the
current Landlords hold title to the property.
 
4.    
The Tenant submitted a copy of the
cover letter for an application for a technical severance for the property
drafted on behalf of the Landlords and received by the Committee of Adjustment on September 20, 2021 – after the N12 was served. This letter




 
outlines the following: both 501
and 503 Palmerston Blvd merged as one property on December 5, 1966 and title
was held by Louis Vass. On August 26, 2016, the title to the merged properties was transferred to Louis Vass and the second-named Landlord.
As of the date of the cover letter,
Louis Vass was deceased, leaving
the current owners
as the named Landlords.
 
5.    
The Tenant submits the application must be dismissed
because a landlord is not
entitled to serve a notice pursuant
to subsection 49(1) if the residential complex
consists of more than three rental units.
 
Landlord’s Evidence
 
6.     The second-named Landlord testified that Louis Vass
was her uncle. She describes the residential complex as two separate old houses whose tax, waste management services and utility
bills were paid separately. The Landlords submit
that the properties used to be on one parcel of land but that they
were technically severed on October 8, 2021. The Landlord submitted a Notice of
Decision in support of this assertion that consents to the landlord’s request
to sever the properties with conditions that must be fulfilled by the Landlords.
 
7.     On cross-examination, the second-named Landlord (CK)
confirmed that one of the reasons why the closing date was extended was because
they were waiting for the property to be severed; she also clarified that they
were waiting for the Certificate of Official
that confirmed the conditions set out on the Notice of Decision
were satisfied. CK also confirmed that at the time the
N12 was served, the properties had not severed.
 
8.     The first-named Landlord (AK) testified that the first
time he became aware that the properties had merged
was when the tax bill for both properties merged
the year prior.
He also testified that the
Tenant was informed in February 2021
of the Landlords’ intention to sell the building.
 
9.     On cross-examination, AK also confirmed that on July
30, 2021, the properties had not severed but that the Landlords were in the
process of submitting the application for technical severance. Furthermore, as of the date of the hearing,
the Certificate of Official
had not been received by the Landlords due to ongoing delays with the COVID19 pandemic.
 
10. 
The Landlords
seek that their application be granted.
ANALYSIS
11.  The N12 notice of termination was filed pursuant
to subsection 49(1) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 which states:
 
49
(1) A landlord of a residential
complex that contains no more than three residential units who has entered
into an agreement of purchase and sale of the residential complex may, on
behalf of the purchaser, give the tenant of a unit in the residential complex
a notice terminating the tenancy, if the purchaser
in good




 
faith requires possession of the residential complex or the unit for the purpose
of residential occupation by,
 
(a)  
the purchaser;
 
…
 
[Emphasis added.]
 
12.  Based on the evidence before the Board, I find that
the Landlords were not entitled to serve the N12 notice of termination pursuant
to subsection 49(1) of the Act when they served this notice to the Tenant
on July 30, 2021. I say this based on the Landlords’ own admission that on July 30, 2021, the properties were still
merged and on one parcel of land.
 
13.  The Board’s records
show an unsolicited post-hearing submission made by the Landlords
on November 29, 2021 that was the Certificate of Official dated November 26,
2021 indicating that consent was given to sever 501 Palmerston Boulevard on
October 12, 2021. This document, however, does not change the Landlords’
ineligibility in serving the N12 on July 30, 2021.
 
14. 
With respect
to the compensation that was paid to the Tenant pursuant
to sections 49.1 and 55.1 of the Act, in the amount
of $2,453.00 and in accordance with section 73.1 of the Act, an order shall
issue requiring the Tenant to return to the Landlords the compensation that was paid, in the amount of $2,453.00 on or before
February 6, 2022.
 
15.  This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
 
2.     The Tenant shall return to the Landlords
the compensation that was paid, in the amount
of $2,453.00, on or before February 6, 2022.
 
3.     If the Tenant fails to comply with paragraph 2 of this
order, the Tenant will start to owe interest.
This will be simple
interest calculated from February 7, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
