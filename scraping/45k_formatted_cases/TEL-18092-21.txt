In the
  matter of:


1659 PORTLAND COURT PICKERING ON L1V5L7


 




Between:


Harrychan Ramcharitar


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Andreas Komitas Lisa Ann Komitas


Tenants



 
 
 
Harrychan Ramcharitar (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Lisa Ann
Komitas and Andreas Komitas (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard on January
18, 2022. The Landlord, represented by Shellyanne
Pereira, and the Tenant, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord has moved back from Alberta for
employment. The Tenant does not
dispute that the Landlord intends
to occupy the rental unit but requested
additional time to vacate the unit. The Tenant was previously evicted due to a landlord’s own use
application and has a child in school. Her
child is in a special school program she would like to keep him in until the
end of the school year.
 
2.    
Based on the submissions from the Tenant,
the Landlord agreed to delay
the termination of the tenancy
until June 30, 2022.
 
3.    
The parties also agreed that if the Tenant finds alternative accommodations before June 30,
2022, the Tenant may give 10 days notice to the Landlord
and terminate the tenancy
early.
 
4.     The Landlord in good faith requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
5. 
6.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,800.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.

7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from August 1, 2020 to
September 30, 2021
 
8.     The Landlord paid the Tenant compensation equal to one month's rent by waiving
August rent.
 
9.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until June 30, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated, as of June 30, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the
rental unit on or before June 30, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before June 30, 2022, then starting July 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after July 1, 2022.
