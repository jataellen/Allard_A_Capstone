Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-25079-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


4,
143 STINSON STREET HAMILTON ON L8N1S7


 




Between:


EIWO Canadian Management Ltd


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Victor Levac


Tenant



 
 
 
EIWO Canadian Management Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Victor Levac (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 18, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Stephanie Lauersen, attended the hearing. As of 10:36 a.m.,
the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period
from May 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective April 14, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $788.00.
 
4.     The
Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $788.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 30, 2021 to September 14, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $2,450.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 15, 2022 pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.




File Number: SOL-25079-21
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before
February 15, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $3,016.47*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
26, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $25.91
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 27, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
15, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 16, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 15, 2022, then starting
February 16, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 16, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$4,095.80 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$4,883.80 if the payment
is made on or before
February 15, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph
and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 16, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
