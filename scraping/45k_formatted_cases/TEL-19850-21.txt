Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19850-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


BASEMENT, 106 GRANGER AVENUE AVENUE
  SCARBOROUGH ON M1K3L3


 




Between:


Md Shaifuddin Mahamood


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Faithmukasa Kaitesi


Tenant



 
 
 
Md Shaifuddin Mahamood (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Faithmukasa Kaitesi (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by way
of video conference on January 19, 2022. The
Landlord attended the hearing
and was represented by Abdul
Shafiqullah. As of 3:56pm the Tenant was not present despite being served with
notice of hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
29, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant paid $2,700.00
after the application was filed.
 
3.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including the impact
of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from
eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of
the rental unit on or before
March 6, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$2,507.81*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 23, 2022.




 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$29.59 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 24, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before March 6, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 7, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 6, 2022, then starting
March 7, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 7, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)$2,886.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022,
or ii)$3,786.00 if the payment is made on or before March 6, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after March
7, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
February 23, 2022
