Drewlo Holdings Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied

the tenancy and evict Scott Tapsell (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 3, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal
Representative, Christina Philp, attended the hearing. As of 2:06 p.m. the Tenant
was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective October 8, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on January
31, 2022. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
3.    
The lawful monthly rent as of January 1, 2022 was
$1,450.20.
4.    
The Tenant paid $2,866.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,433.78 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from August 1, 2020 to
October 8, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of January
31, 2022, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
