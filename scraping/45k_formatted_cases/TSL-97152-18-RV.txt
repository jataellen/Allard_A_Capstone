Review Order
 
TCHC (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict AEM (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved by order TSL-97152-18
issued on January 7, 2019.
 
On February 7, 2019, the Tenant requested a review of
the order.
 
The request was heard in Toronto on May 29, 2019.
 
The Landlord’s legal representative, RA, and the
Tenant’s legal representatives, JC and JE, attended the hearing. 
 
Determinations:
 
Tenant’s adjournment request denied 
1.     
The Tenant’s legal
representatives requested an adjournment on the Tenant’s behalf. They advised
that they were retained by the Tenant one week before the hearing and they
required time to prepare, including investigating whether the Tenant is paying
the correct rent. The Landlord opposed the adjournment. 
2.     
After hearing from both
parties, I denied the Tenant’s adjournment because I found that the prejudice
to the Landlord of granting the adjournment outweighed the prejudice to the
Tenant of denying the request. Specifically, I considered the following
circumstances: 
•        
The Tenant’s representatives
were asking for time to prepare for the hearing. However, the Tenant was not
present to explain why he waited until one week before the hearing to find
legal representation and why he did not do so earlier. The Tenant’s request to
review was originally scheduled to be heard on March 4, 2019 but was adjourned
due to a scheduling overflow. The Tenant had over two months between these
hearing dates to find legal representation; it is unknown why he waited to the
last minute. I do not think that the adjournment is appropriate because I am
not satisfied that the Tenant took reasonable steps to find legal
representation as soon as possible. 
•        
The Tenant’s legal
representatives also asked for the adjournment to given them time to look into
whether the Tenant is paying the correct amount of rent and whether they should
be challenging this amount through the Landlord’s internal review process. However,
I find this is not a compelling reason to grant an adjournment because the
amount of the Tenant’s rent depends on his eligibility for a housing subsidy
and 1) pursuant to section 203(a) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
“Act”), the Board does not have jurisdiction to make determinations or review
decisions concerning eligibility for RGI assistance as defined in section 38 of
the Housing Services Act, 2011 or any amount of geared-to-income rent
payable under that Act; and 2) the period for requesting an internal review of
the Landlord’s Notice of Decision regarding the amount of the Tenant’s rent has
passed (the deadline was December 26, 2018). 
•        
The arrears are substantial.
As of the date of the hearing, the arrears totalled $16,308.00. The Landlord
would suffer prejudice if the hearing was postponed and this amount remained
for a further few months. Further, the Tenant did not comply with the Board’s
interim order, issued March 4, 2019, requiring the Tenant to pay the rent
pending the resolution of the matter. Therefore, I find it more likely than not
that the arrears will continue to increase if the matter was adjourned. 
Landlord’s request to review granted 
3.     
I am satisfied on a balance
of probabilities that the Board’s order TSL-97152-18, issued January 7, 2019
contains a serious error. Specifically, I find that the Member erred by
dismissing the application because the Tenant was discharged from bankruptcy on
July 25, 2017, within the first rental period for which the Landlord claims
arrears. 
4.     
However, for the purpose of
this application, the relevant date in the Tenant’s bankruptcy proceedings is
the day when there was an assignment in bankruptcy – i.e. June 21, 2017.
Pursuant to section 69.3 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, the
assignment resulted in an automatic stay of proceedings up to the assignment
date. However, the first rental period covered by the N4 Notice of Termination
begins after the assignment date, on July 1, 2017. Therefore, the stay does not
impact this application or the Board’s proceedings and the application should
not have been dismissed. Accordingly, the Landlord’s request to review is
granted. 
 
 
L1 Application
5.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from July 1, 2017 to
November 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective April 18, 2018.
6.     
The application is amended
to reflect that from July, 2017 to May, 2018, the monthly rent was $650.00 but
in June, 2018, the rent was increased to $1,134.00, due to a change in the
Tenant’s subsidy entitlement. Specifically, the table on page 4 of the
application is amended to reflect that during the second rental period from
April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018, the rent charged was $2,434.00 and during the
third rental period from July 1 – 31, 2018, the rent charged was $1,134.00.  
7.     
The Tenant paid $4,450.00
after the application was filed.
8.     
The Landlord claimed that as
of the hearing date the Tenant owed $16,498.00, including arrears of rent to
May 31, 2019 and the application filing fee. The Tenant’s legal representatives
did not have any evidence to challenge the amount the Landlord is claiming.
Therefore, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that as of the hearing
date, the Tenant owed the Landlord $16,498.00. 
9.     
This order is being issued
in the month following the hearing; therefore, it includes an additional
month’s rent. If the Tenant has paid June’s rent and/or he has made any other
payments to the Landlord since the hearing, these payments should be deducted
from the total owing in this order. 
Section 83 considerations 
10.  
The Tenant’s legal
representatives requested that the Board find that mandatory refusal of the
application is warranted because the Landlord is in serious breach of its
obligations. They made submissions that the Tenant is living in an unsafe
environment and three of his children have been physically assaulted at the
residential complex. However, they were unable to provide any particulars
regarding these incidents, including when they occurred, who committed the
assaults, if/when the Landlord was advised and how the Landlord responded.
Without this information, I cannot determine whether these incidents occurred,
whether they represent breaches by the Landlord under the Act and whether these
breaches are ongoing. Therefore, I cannot find that mandatory refusal of the
application under section 83 is appropriate in this case. 
11.  
The Landlord’s legal
representative advised that the Landlord was prepared to postpone the
termination date until July 7, 2019. For the same reasons that form the basis
of my decision to deny the Tenant’s adjournment request, I find that it would
not be appropriate to extend the termination date any further. Accordingly, I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it would not be unfair to postpone
the eviction until July 7, 2019 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Landlord’s request to
review order TSL-97152-18 issued on January 7, 2019 is granted.
2.     
Order TSL-97152-18 issued on
January 7, 2019 is cancelled and replaced by the following: 
3.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before July 7,
2019.
4.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $13,054.86*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to June 11, 2019.
5.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $26.67 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
June 12, 2019 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
6.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
7.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before July 7, 2019, then starting July 8, 2019, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
8.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 8, 2019.
9.     
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $17,632.00 if the payment is made on or before June 30, 2019, or
ii)       $18,766.00 if the payment is made on or before July 7, 2019**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
10.  
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after July 8, 2019 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
