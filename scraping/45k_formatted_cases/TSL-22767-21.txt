In the matter

  ON M8V1E5


 




Between:


Lakeshore Blvd. GP
  Limited


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


George
Martin Senchak


Tenant



 
 
 
Lakeshore Blvd.
GP Limited (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict George Martin Senchak (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021. The Landlord’s Legal
Representative, Daniel Abraham
and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
The Tenant spoke
with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
April 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective June 25,
2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $844.26.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $832.66 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021 to June 25, 2021.
 
6.    
The Tenant
paid $5,115.56 after the application was filed.
 
7.    
It is uncontested the
total rent arrears owing to the Landlord by the Tenant up to December 31, 2021 is $634.08 and further, the arrears are the result
of a missed rent payment
from April 2020.




 
8.    
The Tenant stated he
loaned money to his brother so he did not have money to pay April 2020 rent. As
his brother has never repaid the money he borrowed, the rent to the Landlord
remains unpaid. His only source of
income is ODSP ($1399.00/mth) and he has been
paying the Landlord
an extra $20.00 per month with his rent towards
the arrears. He has never missed or been late with a
rent payment in the 5.5 years he has resided in the unit. At the hearing he did
receive information regarding the “rent bank” and will be contacting them to
inquire about assistance. He requested the Board grant relief and impose a
repayment plan; $25.00 per month until the arrears and costs are paid in full.
 
9.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act') including the Tenant’s personal and financial
circumstances and weighed this against any potential prejudice to the Landlord
and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $820.08,
which represents the arrears of rent
($634.04), and costs ($186.00) outstanding for the period ending December 31,
2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s application for eviction
of the Tenant is denied
on the condition that:
 
•        
The Tenant
shall pay $25.00
to the Landlord on or before the 1st of each month commencing on January 1, 2022, up
to and including August 1, 2024.
 
•        
The Tenant
shall pay $20.08 to the Landlord on or before
September 1, 2024.
 
•        
The Tenant
shall also pay the Landlord
the rent for the months
of January 2022 up to and
including September 2024 in full, on or before the first day of each
corresponding month.
 
3.    
If the Tenant fails to make any of the
payments in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates required, then:
 
(a)  
The Landlord may apply
under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for
an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, and for the payment
of any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not already ordered under paragraph
1 of this order. The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a
breach of a condition set out in paragraph 2 of this order.
 
(b)  
The balance owing under
paragraph 1 of this order shall become payable on the day following the date of default.
The monies owing shall bear interest
at the post-judgment interest
rate determined under subsection 207(7) of the Act.
