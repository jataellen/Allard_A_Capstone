Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57593-22
 
 



In the
  matter of:


302, 1170 HAMILTON ROAD LONDON ON N5W1A9


 




Between:


Maple Property Management Group


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Tamika Richardson


Tenant



 
 
 
Maple Property Management Group (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Tamika Richardson (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant
pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on July 15, 2021 with respect to
application SWL-48805-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $547.40 arrears
on or before November 20, 2021. The Tenant did not pay $788.90 rent on or before
November 1, 2021.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $3,284.40 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
SWL-48805-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $1,094.80
and that amount is included
in this order.
As a result, the previous order SWL-48805-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from November 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.




File Number: SWL-57593-22
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SWL-48805-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 7, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
pay to the Landlord $3,461.50*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 27, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $25.94 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 28, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 7, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
February 8, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 7, 2022, then starting
February 8, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 8, 2022.

6, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
