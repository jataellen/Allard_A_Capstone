Amended Order
Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
And section 21.1 of the Statutory Powers Procedure Act
 
 
File Number: TSL-94607-18-AM
 
 
This amended order is issued to correct
a clerical error in the address and pagination in the original order issued on
June 8, 2018. The amendment has been bolded and highlighted for easy reference.
The rest of the order remains unchanged.
N.A
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict C.K
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has not paid the rent the Tenant owes (“the
L1 application”). 
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the
unit after the termination date as well as administration charges related to
NSF cheques (“the L2 application”). 
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on June 1, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord’s legal representative, BLS (“BLS”) attended the
hearing.  
 
The Tenant did not attend the hearing. Prior to the hearing on
June 1, 2018, the Tenant contacted the Board by telephone to indicate she would
not be attending the hearing, or sending a representative to attend, as she planned
to attend at a new job.   Nonetheless, I waited until after 10 a.m.  When the
Tenant still did not arrive, and no one attended on her behalf, I proceeded to
hear the Landlord’s applications.
 
 
Determinations:
 
L2 application
 
1.      The
Landlord’s N8 Notice of Termination is defective as it does not comply with
s.58(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (“the Act”).  This
subsection requires the termination date given in an N8 Notice to be “…the
day a period of the tenancy ends….”.  The termination date given in the N8
Notice of Termination served upon the Tenant in this matter is July 29, 2018. 
This is not a day on which a period of the tenancy ends (for July 2018 this
would be July 31, 2018). As such, the N8 Notice does not comply with s.58(2) of
the Act. 
 
2.      In
the light of the information in paragraph 1, above, BLS requested the Board’s
consent to withdraw the L2 application and I consented to this withdrawal.
L1
application
3.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from November 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective March 23, 2018.
 
4.      The
summary provided by BLS at the hearing indicates the Tenant owes $13,450.00 in
arrears and $190.00 for the filing fee for a total claim by the Landlord of
$13,640.00.   While the Landlord’s application also mentions $140.00 in
NSF-cheque related charges (without particulars), BLS withdrew these NSF claims
at the hearing.
 
5.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $2,350.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from August 15, 2017
to March 23, 2018.
 
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
L2
application
1.      The
Landlord’s L2 application is withdrawn.
L1
application
2.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before June 19, 2018.
 
3.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $9,400.40*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to June 8, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $77.26 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting June 9, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
6.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June
19, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from June 20, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
7.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before June 19, 2018, then starting June 20,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 20, 2018.
 
9.      If,
on or before June 19, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $13,640.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
10.   The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after June 20, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
