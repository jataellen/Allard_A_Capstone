Order under
Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number:
TNL-36279-21




 
In the matter
  of:


 
695 NASHVILLE ROAD KLEINBURG ON L0J1C0


 




Between:


Avant Management Services Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Gabriella Fiore-soufiani


Tenant



 
 
 
On November 27,
2021, Avant Management Services Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied in this L4
application for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Gabriella Fiore-soufiani (the
'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because
the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the consent order issued by
the Board on November 8, 2021 with respect to L1 application TNL-33676-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The consent order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following condition specified in the order: The Tenant failed to pay $28,000.00 towards
the arrears, on or before
November 5, 2021. This was a breach of paragraph 5(b) of the
consent order. This L4 application was filed within 30 days of the breach.
 
3.       
The previous L1 application included a request
for an order for the payment
of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the
Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in
addition to eviction, in this L4 application the Landlord is entitled to
request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $35,000.00 for rent arrears in the previous
consent Order TNL-33676-21.
The Tenant failed to make any payments towards the previous consent order, so
the amount that is still owing from that order is $35,000.00 and that amount is
included in this order. As a result,
the previous consent
order TNL-33676-21 is cancelled.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The previous consent order TNL-33676-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January
24, 2022 (standard 11 days from the issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
If the Tenant made any payments
after this L4 application was filed, those amounts shall be deducted from the calculations
below.
 
4.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $38,853.97*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 31, 2022 (the issuance
date of this order).
 
5.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$88.77 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 14, 2022 to
the date the Tenant actually moves out of the rental unit or gets evicted.
 
6.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
24, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 25, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 24, 2022, then starting January
25, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 25, 2022.

The tenant has until January 23, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 23, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.
 
If you have any questions about this order,

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on July 25, 2022 if the order has not been
filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that
has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
