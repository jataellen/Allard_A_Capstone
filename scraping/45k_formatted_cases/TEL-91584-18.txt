Order
under Section 68
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006

Landlord’s L1 application.
P. K. (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict M. P. (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
Landlord’s L2 application.
P. K. (the 'Landlord') also applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict M. P. (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted
in the residential complex has used
the rental unit or the residential complex in a manner that is inconsistent
with use as a residential premises and that has caused or can be expected to
cause significant damage and because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant; and because the
Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person the Tenant permitted in
the residential complex has seriously impaired the safety of any person. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after
the termination date.
 
Landlord’s L8 application.
P. K. (the 'Landlord') also applied
for an order determining whether M. P. (the 'Tenant') altered the locking
system without the Landlord's consent.
 
These applications were heard in
Whitby on July 27, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
With respect to the
Landlord’s L1 application, the
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from May 1, 2018 to July 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective May 9, 2018.
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $2,050.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.
4.     
The Tenant also gave the
Landlord three NSF cheques.
5.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until August 27, 2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of
the Act.
6.     
With respect to the
Landlord’s L2 application,
the Landlord served the Tenant with two different notices.
7.     
The first notice was an N7
notice for serious impairment of safety of a person and also for use of the
unit being inconsistent with use as a residential unit.
8.     
No evidence was presented at
the hearing that was even close to either of these descriptions and the N7
notice was dismissed.
9.     
The Landlord also served an
N5 notice.
10.  
The first matter under the
loss of reasonable enjoyment was the fact that the Landlord is storing items in
the basement. As this is clearly set out in the lease agreement between the
parties this matter was dismissed.
11.  
The other issues were over
smoking in a non smoking building and the Tenant not cooperating with
inspections of the unit as allowed under the Residential Tenancies Act.
12.  
While there was no clear
evidence on either of these matters, on the balance of probabilities it is
possible that they may have occurred.
13.  
The tenant agreed at the
hearing that these would never occur again and as a result a section 78
provision was placed in the order so that if the order is voided under the
payment issues the section 78 clause will live on for a one year period.
14.  
The Landlord was warned at
the hearing that if section 78 is breached and an eviction is applied for
strong evidence would have to be shown at any hearing.
15.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
16.  
With respect to the
Landlord’s L8 application, the
Tenant will be ordered to give a copy of all keys to the Landlord.
17.   The Reasons contained in this order constitute
all of the reasons used in making my decision.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before August 27,
2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $2,517.45*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to August 7, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $67.40 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
August 8, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord the sum of $81.00 for three NSF cheques given to the Landlord.
6.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before August 27, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
August 28, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
7.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before August 27, 2018, then starting August 28, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
8.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after August 88, 2018.
9.     
If, on or before August 27,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $6,421.00** in guaranteed funds to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
10.  
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after August 28, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
11.  
If the order is voided as
per paragraph # 9 or # 10, then for the next year until August 6, 2019 the
Tenant will fully cooperate with all access for the Landlord into the unit as
long as it is done as per the Residential Tenancies Act and further the
Tenant or any of his guests or occupants will not smoke inside of the rental
unit or within the residential complex.
12.  
Failure to do as directed in
paragraph # 11 will allow the Landlord to apply to the board under Section 78
of the Residential Tenancies Act (2006), without notice to the Tenant,
for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord must
make this application no later than 30 days after the Tenant’s breach of the
paragraph.
