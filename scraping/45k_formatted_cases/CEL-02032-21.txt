Order under Section

Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-02032-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


BASEMENT, 53 VALLEYCREEK DRIVE BRAMPTON ON L6P2E2


 




Between:


Thevakaruna Jeyapalan


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Gary Hoffman


Tenant



 
 
 
Thevakaruna Jeyapalan (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict
Gary Hoffman (the 'Tenant') because
the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the
unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on November 4, 2021.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord Representative James Hill and the Tenant Agent Lorean Hoffman attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord served the Tenant with an N12 notice of termination seeking
termination of the tenancy
for the purpose of residential occupation by the Landlord.
 
2.     The termination date in the Form N12 is
September 30, 2021. The Landlord has met the 60 day notice requirement of s.48(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
“Act”), the declaration requirement of
s.72(1)(b) of the Act, as well as the one month’s compensation requirement
under s. 48.1 of the Act.
 
3.    
In order to be
successful in this application, the Landlord must also satisfy the Board that
he requires, in good faith, possession of the rental unit for the
purpose of residential occupation for a period of at least one year. In Salter v. Beljinac, 2001 CanLII 40231 (ON SCDC), the court clarified the Landlord’s good faith
requirement as follows:
 
In my view, s.51(1) charges the finder of fact with the task of
determining whether the landlord’s professed intent to want to reclaim the unit
for a family member is genuine, that is, the notice to terminate the tenancy is
made in good faith. The alternative finding of fact would be that the landlord
does not have a genuine intent to reclaim the unit for the purpose of residential
occupation by a family member.




 
 
 
4.    
I am satisfied on a
balance of probabilities that the Landlord, in good faith, requires possession
of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation for at least one year.
 
5.     The Landlord’s spouse passed away in
November 2020. At the hearing, it was submitted that the
Landlord’s medical condition requires him to have daily supervision. The rental
unit is in the basement of the residential complex and the Landlord currently
lives in the upper unit of the residential complex. Ultimately, it is the Landlord’s intention to move into the rental unit, in order to allow
his daughter and her family to move into the Landlord’s larger upper unit.
 
6.    
The Landlord’s daughter
moved from Seattle to assist the Landlord and currently lives in a rental in Oakville, Ontario and visits
him daily.
 
7.     The Tenant challenges the Landlord’s
professed intent. The Tenant’s
spouse, Lorean Hoffman (“LC), testified the Landlord served the Tenant with the
Form N12 after trying to raise rent from $850 to $975. It is the Tenant’s position that the Landlord’s professed intent
is not genuine and is motivated by a desire to increase the rent for the unit.
While on cross-examination, the Tenant’s agent also questioned whether the
Landlord’s daughter was searching for a senior’s residence for the Landlord, no
evidence was presented to substantiate this allegation.
 
8.     While the Landlord may have had past
discussions with the Tenant about increasing the rent, I do not find that rent
is a motivating factor for the service of the Landlord’s Form N12. The Landlord has had some significant
changes in his life. The medical documentation confirms the Landlord’s
requirement for daily supervision and since the Landlord’s daughter has already
taken steps to relocate to Canada to assist her father, I find it believable
that the Landlord would seek to move into the rental unit so that his daughter
and her family can be closer to him.
 
9.    
Section 83 requires
that the Board consider all the circumstances in the case, including the Tenant’s
and the Landlord’s situations, to determine
if it would be appropriate to delay
or deny eviction in the form of section 83 relief. The Tenant was out of the country at the time of hearing but
returning later in 2021. In the event that eviction was ordered, the Tenant’s
agent advised the Tenant would require until February 2022. Since there is no immediate identified
urgency on the part of the Landlord, I believe it to be fair and appropriate to
delay the eviction in order to give the Tenant additional time to find other
accommodations. I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances of the Tenants and Landlord in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act
and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February
28, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
February 28, 2022.The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before February 28, 2022.




 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $27.95 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from January 18, 2022 to the date
the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before January
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
5.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 1, 2022.
