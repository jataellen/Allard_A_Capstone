P. (P.) P. (the 'Landlord') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict C. L. (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
The Tenant applied for an order determining
that the Landlord failed to meet the Landlord's maintenance obligations under
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') or failed to comply with
health, safety, housing or maintenance standards.
 
These applications were heard in Ottawa on
November 15, 2016.
 
The Landlord’s Agent, A.
P., and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Evidence and Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent she was
required to pay for the period from September 1, 2016 to November 30, 2016. 
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
October 21, 2016.
2.      The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date of the
hearing. However, she indicated that she was planning on moving out by November
30th  
3.      The monthly rent is $830.00.
4.      The Landlord is not holding a last month's rent deposit. 
5.      The Landlord did not receive any payments from the Tenant since the
application was filed. However, the Tenant claimed that she paid the Landlord the
monthly rent for October 2016 in cash on October 2nd but the Landlord
did not provide her with a receipt. The Tenant also claimed that, on September
1st, she paid the Landlord $630.00 in cash towards the September
rent but was not provided with a receipt on that occasion either. The Landlord
had no record of receiving these payments. 
6.      The Tenant indicated that, since moving into the rental unit in July
2016, there was repeated series of occurrences where she would ask the Landlord
to undertake certain repairs, the Landlord would tell her that he would do so
and provide her with a time when he would come to do the repairs but that he
would then either not show up at the time indicated or, if he did show up, only
do part of the work and fail to return to complete it.
7.      The nature of the Tenant’s request to the Landlord included fixing
smoke detectors that were not working moved in, moving numerous garbage cans that
were placed in front of her entrance by the sidewalk, removing litter in the
front yard, fixing kitchen shelves that had fallen, putting screens on the
kitchen windows that were necessary because of an infestation of fruit flies,
fixing an improperly installed pharmacy cabinet in the bathroom, addressing a
mice infestation, giving the Tenant the ability to control the thermostat, replacing
the mailbox that was rusting and providing her with her own mailbox rather than
having to share one with other tenants of the residential complex.
8.      The Tenant provided the Board with an inspection report from the
City of Ottawa dated October 5, 2016 which found that the Landlord was in
violation of the property standards bylaw and ordered a series of corrective
actions, including fixing a broken window, providing a separate mailbox for
each Tenant, ensuring that garbage cans are not located in the front yard,
repairing the kitchen cupboards, repairing bathroom items including the vanity,
vanity top, vanity drawers and vanity door and having an exterminator come into
the unit to address the mice infestation. The Landlord was required to complete
the corrective action by November 5th .
9.      The Landlord’s agent testified that the work required by the City of
Ottawa had been completed. He stated that the unit has a thermostat which the
Tenant is able to control.
10.   In her application, the Tenant sought compensation of $508.00 for
damaged property. This includes $275.00 for a vase that she claims was broken
by the Landlord when he was fixing the cupboard doors and $233.00 for perfume
bottles which were broken when the pharmacy cabinet fell on her. The Tenant
also sought $240.00 in compensation for the cost to hire individuals to clean
up the front yard. 
11. 
I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenant is in
a significant amount of arrears and, by her own admission, she is not interested
in continuing to live at the residential unit. 
12. 
With respect to the Tenant’s contention that she
paid her rent for the months of September and October 2016, it was her
responsibility to either obtain a receipt from the Landlord or provide some
other form of proof of payment, such as a bank withdrawal slip.  I cannot
accept her word over that of the Landlord in the absence of any supporting
documentation.
13. 
However, I find that the Tenant is entitled to a
rent abatement of $1,000.00 for the difficulties that she experienced during
the course of the tenancy due to the Landlord’s failure to complete necessary
repairs in a timely fashion. I am satisfied that the evidence establishes that
the Landlord was not in substantial compliance with his obligation under s. 20
of the Act to maintain the residential unit in a good state of repair. The
Landlord’s contention that it completed all of the repairs required by the
Bylaw Enforcement Officer’s report in a timely fashion does not appear to be
supported by the evidence.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out
below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The
Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before January 20, 2017.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,586.24*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January 9, 2017
less an amount of $1,000.00 which represents an abatement of rent.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $27.29
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 10, 2017 to
the date he moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$170.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before January 20, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe
interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from January 21, 2017 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated on or before January 20,
2017, then starting January 21, 2017, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord, on or after January 21, 2017.
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void this order and
continue the tenancy, she must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust $3,320.00
if the payment is made on or before      January 20, 2017**. If the Tenant does
not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate
deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
 
 
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after    January 21, 2017 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to
make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
