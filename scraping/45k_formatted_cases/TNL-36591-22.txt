Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-36591-22
 
 



In the
  matter of:


APT 201, 15504
YONGE STREET AURORA ON
  L4G1P2


 




Between:


Orlando Ieraci


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Travis Keeler


Tenant



 
 
 
Orlando Ieraci (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Travis Keeler (the
'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes
because the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified in the order
issued by the Board on April 20, 2021
with respect to application TNL-28215-20.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following condition
specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $5000.00
arrears on or before January 17, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $11,454.78 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order TNL-28215-20. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $9,054.78 and that amount
is included in this order. As a result, the previous order TNL-28215-20 is
cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from February 1, 2022 to February 28, 2022.




 
 
 
 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,018.76 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from August 21, 2020 to February 8, 2022.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.     Order TNL-28215-20 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 19, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $8,317.12*(less any amount paid since the application was filed on
January 24, 2022.) This amount represents the rent owing up to February 8, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$35.26 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 9, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 19, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
February 20, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 19, 2022, then starting February
20, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 20, 2022.
 
 
February 8, 2022

The tenant has until February 18, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by February 18, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on August 20, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
