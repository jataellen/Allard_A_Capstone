On January 17, 2022, Geoff Richardson and 2345376 Ont Inc
(the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Chris Andrews (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant entered into
an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlords and the Tenant signed an agreement to
terminate the tenancy as of January 15, 2022 and the Tenant did not move out of the rental
unit by the termination date
set out in the agreement.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 11, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount
owing on or before February
11, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 12, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 11, 2022, then starting
February 12, 2022, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
5.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after February 12, 2022.
