Order under Section
77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24516-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


125 CATHERINE STREET FORT ERIE ON L2A2H7


 




Between:


Stoyan Stoyanov


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Josh Pirson Kristin Rusins


Tenants



 
 
 
Stoyan Stoyanov (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Josh Pirson
and Kristin Rusins (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
entered into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on December 1, 2021. Only the Landlord
attended the hearing. As of 9:31 a.m., the Tenants were not present
or represented although
properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord and the
Tenants signed an agreement to terminate the tenancy as of June 30, 2022.
 
2.    
This application was sent to a hearing by way
of Endorsement dated September 14, 2021 as the Landlord had not filed an
affidavit verifying the agreement to terminate
the tenancy pursuant to section 77(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the ‘Act’).
 
3.    
At the hearing,
submitted into evidence was a declaration signed and affirmed by both Tenants
dated November 3, 2021. It states that they agree to terminate the tenancy with
the Landlord at the rental address on June 30, 2022.
 
4.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenants did not attend the hearing
to make submissions on relief from eviction. The Landlord was not aware of any
circumstances for me to consider relief from eviction.
 
It is ordered that:




File Number: SOL-24516-21
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before June 30, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 30, 2022, then starting July 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after July 1, 2022.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires on January 1, 2023 if the order has not been
filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that
has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
