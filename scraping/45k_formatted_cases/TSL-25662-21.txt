Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 



 


File Number:
TSL-25662-21




In the
matter of:


502, 24 EVA ROAD TORONTO ON M9C2B2


 




Between:


Westmall Investments


Landlord




 


And


 




 


Isabela Peron


Tenant



 
On November 10, 2021,
Westmall Investments (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Isabela
Peron (the 'Tenant') and for an order to
have the Tenant pay the rent he owes because
the Tenant failed to meet a
condition specified in the
order issued by the Board on
November 3, 2021 with respect to application TSL-21512-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant
if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed to pay to the Landlord
$1,204.60 on or before November
5, 2021 towards rent.
 
3.       
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$4,819.60 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order TSL-21512-21. The amount that is still owing from that
order is $1,619.60 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order TSL-21512-21 is cancelled.
 
5.       
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,145.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenant for the period from May 1, 2007 to January 5, 2022.




File Number: TSL-25662-21
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.       
Order TSL-21512-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 16, 2022.
 
3.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,410.99*. This amount represents the rent owing up to November 30, 2021 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$39.60 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting December 1, 2021 to
the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
16, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January
17, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after January 17, 2022.

The tenant has until January 15, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 15, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating

has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
