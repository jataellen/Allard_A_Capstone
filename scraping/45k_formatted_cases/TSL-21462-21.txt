Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: TSL-21462-21
 



In the matter
of:


2013, 100 WELLESLEY STREET E TORONTO ON
  M4Y1H5


 




Between:


Capreit Limited Partnership


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Aidan
O'Bryne Daniel Harris


Tenants



 
 
 
Capreit Limited
Partnership (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Aidan O'Bryne and Daniel Harris (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe. The Landlord
also claimed NSF cheque charges
and related administration charges.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, N. Sharma, attended
the hearing. As of 1:46 p.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at
the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period
from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective April 13,
2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord
incurred charges of $70.00 for cheques tendered
by or on behalf of the
Tenants, which were returned NSF and $280.00 for related administration
charges.
 
3.    
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
 
4.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $2,250.00.
 
5.    
The Landlord
is not holding a last month's rent deposit.
 
6.    
The Tenants
paid $2,250.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.

It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 16, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$23,311.63*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 5, 2022 and the total charges related to
NSF cheques tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenants.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $73.97
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 6, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
16, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 17,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January
17, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 17, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 16, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $25,286.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after January
17, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
