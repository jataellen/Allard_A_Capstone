Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-54357-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


20 MCDONALD AVENUE LONDON ON N6G1B1


 




Between:


Andrew Pritchard


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Alexander Brownlee
  Kyle Barker
Philip
Gibson


Tenants



 
 
Andrew Pritchard
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Alexander Brownlee, Philip Gibson and Kyle Barker
(the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe
(L1 application). The Landlord also
applied for an order terminating the tenancy because the Tenant, another
occupant or someone permitted into the residential complex by the Tenant wilfully
or negligently damaged
the rental unit (L2 application).
 
This application was heard by way of video conference on December 20, 2021. The Landlord
attended the hearing and was represented by Nikisha Evans, Paralegal. As of 11:30am the Tenant was not present,
despite being served with notice of hearing by the Bord.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 application:
 
1.    
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from November 1, 2020 to December
31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective June 24, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
paid $3,000.00 after the application was filed.
 
3.    
The Landlord has
attempted to contact the Tenants by way of letter and email on June 17, 2021 and in September 2021. The Tenants
did not respond or propose
a repayment plan.
 
L2 application:
 
4.    
The Landlord’s application is based on a single N5 notice served
to the Tenants on June 29, 2021 with a termination date of
July 19, 2021.




 
5.    
The property
is a single detached dwelling. The Tenants reside
in the entire house.
 
6.    
On June 4, 2021 the
Landlord conducted an inspection of the rental unit. During the inspections the Landlord discovered that the paint on
the inside of the front door had been peeled off, the runner on the stairs inside the rental unit had been damaged
and torn off, the window screens in the bedroom and sunroom had been damaged
and removed, the walls had been repainted and excessive paint splatter was on
the baseboards and that there was excessive amounts
of garbage being piled up outside the rental unit. The Landlord entered into evidence pictures of the damages and
excess garbage (LL exhibit #1).
 
7.    
The Landlord’s N5
notice required the Tenants to repair and/or replace the damaged property and
to remove any excess garbage on or before July 6, 2021. The Landlord testified that the Tenants had not repaired
or replaced any of the damaged property
or removed the excess garbage.
 
8.    
On July 10, 2021 the Landlord
attempted to enter the rental
unit to get an estimate
for the costs of repairs, but
the Tenants refused the Landlord access to the rental unit. The Landlord testified that as of this
date, the excess garbage and clutter was still present outside the rental unit.
 
9.    
Section 62 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
Act) states:
 
62 (1) A landlord may give a tenant
notice of termination of the tenancy if the tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or a person whom the tenant permits in the residential complex
wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to the rental unit or the residential complex.
 
(2)  
A notice
of termination under
this section shall,
 
(a)    
provide a termination date not earlier
than the 20th day after
the notice is given;
(b)    
set out the grounds
for termination; and
(c)    
require the tenant, within seven days,
 
(i)    to repair
the damaged property
or pay to the landlord
the reasonable costs of
repairing the damaged property, or
 
(ii)    
to replace the damaged
property or pay to the landlord the reasonable costs of replacing the damaged property, if it is not reasonable to repair the damaged
property.
 
(3)  
The notice of
termination under this section is void if the tenant, within seven days after
receiving the notice, complies with the requirement referred to in clause (2) (c) or makes arrangements satisfactory to the landlord to comply with that requirement.




 
10.  Based on the uncontested evidence before
the Board, I am satisfied that the Tenants have willfully and/or negligently damaged the rental
unit by damaging the screens
in the rental unit and by removing the runner on the stairs.
I am also satisfied that the Tenants failed to void the N5 notice by
not repairing the damaged items.
 
11.  I am not satisfied that the excess garbage
or painting the rental unit without the Landlord’s consent constitutes willful
or negligent damage. Although I
appreciate the Landlord’s concerns with these allegations, the Landlord’s N5 was not served pursuant to section 64(1) of the Act,
which speaks to substantial interference with reasonable enjoyment, lawful
right and/or privileges.
 
Relief from eviction:
 
12.  I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties
and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenants and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from
eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
13.  The rent arrears are substantial, and the
Tenants were not present at the hearing to propose a repayment plan, discuss any intention to repair the damages or seek any other
form of relief. Therefore, even if
the Tenant pays the full amount owing as per the L1 application, the tenancy
will still terminate on a non-remedial basis pursuant to the L2 application
 
 
It is
ordered that:
 
14.  The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 17, 2022.
 
15.  The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$22,654.19*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 6, 2022.
 
16.  The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $64.11
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 7, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
17. 
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
18. 
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
17, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 18,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
19.  If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 17, 2022, then starting
January 18, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.




 
20.  Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 18, 2022.
