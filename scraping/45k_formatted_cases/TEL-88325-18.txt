Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-88325-18
 










 
 
 

2526055
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict O.M.
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Whitby on February 26, 2018.
 
The president of the company, K.P.l, the property manager, J.L.,
and the Tenant attended the hearing. 
 
Preliminary Issue:
 

At
     the outset of the hearing, the Tenant alleged that ‘S’ was another named Tenant
     on the lease. The Tenant did not have a copy of the lease document to
     confirm that there was another named Tenant. S did not attend the hearing
     to provide any testimony. 
The
     Landlord took over the property from the previous owner and he says that
     the Tenant was the only Tenant the previous Landlord identified to him. 
At
     the hearing, I found that the Tenant had led insufficient evidence to
     confirm that S. is a named Tenant on the lease. While it is likely the
     case that S. has been an occupant of the rental unit since the tenancy
     began, I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that she is a
     named Tenant. 

Determinations:
4.    The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from September 1, 2017 to February 28, 2018.  Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective January 31, 2018.
5.    The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending February 28, 2018, total $5,275.00.
6.    The
Landlord incurred costs as a result of filing the application in the amount of
$175.00 and is entitled to reimbursement for those costs. 
7.    The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $850.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
8.    Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 1, 2017 to
January 31, 2018, $9.01.
9.    I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). In
particular, I have considered that the Tenant lives in the unit with his
daughter, his 2 year old granddaughter and the adult occupant mentioned above.
The three adults split the monthly rent between them, but they have been
withholding their rent for the past several months and have spent the money
elsewhere. 
10. Based
on the household monthly income, the three adults cannot afford the monthly
rent and cannot afford to pay the outstanding arrears. The Tenant is seeking
relief from eviction in the form of delay until the end of March, 2018. 
11. The
Landlord is suffering financial hardship as the arrears are now quite
substantial and the Landlord is paying the property taxes and utilities. As the
hearing took place on February 26, 2018, and there has already been a delay of
at least two weeks, I find that it would be unfair to grant any further relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It
is ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before March 26, 2018.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4,592.84*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to March 15, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $27.95 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting March 16, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March
26, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from March 27, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before March 26, 2018, then starting March 27,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 27, 2018.
8.      If,
on or before March 26, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $6,125.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after March 27, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
