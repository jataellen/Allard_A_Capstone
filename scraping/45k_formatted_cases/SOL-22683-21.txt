Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-22683-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


B, 320 JOHN STREET MOUNT FOREST ON N0G2L3


 




Between:


Brian Zeinstra


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jeff Petty


Tenant



 
 
 
Brian Zeinstra
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Jeff Petty
(the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for
the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard
by way of Videoconference on December 15, 2021. Only the Landlord attended the hearing. As of 9:47am
the Tenant was not present despite being served with notice
of hearing from the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s application is based on a N12 Notice of Termination served to the Tenant on June 27, 2021 with a
termination date of August 31, 2021.
 
 
Landlord’s Uncontested Evidence:
 
 
2.    
The residential complex is a two-story dwelling. It contains two rental units,
with a front and back unit. The back unit is identified as Unit B.
 
3.    
The Landlord
communicated to the Tenant that his obligation to pay the monthly rent was
waived for July 2021.
 
4.    
In support
of this application, the Landlord filed
an affidavit signed
by Jacob Zeinstra, who is the son of the Landlord, declaring that he requires the
rental unit for his own personal use for a period of one-year.




 
5.    
The Landlord testified
that he, his wife, and son reside in Holstein Ontario, and the Landlord is
downsizing from their current residence. The
Landlord’s son works in Alliston, Ontario, and requires possession of the
rental unit to commute to work and because his parents
are downsizing to a smaller
home. The rental
unit is approximately 15 minutes closer to his
work.
 
Analysis:
 
 
6.    
The N12 Notice was served pursuant
to section 48 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act') which states, in part:
 
48 (1) A landlord may, by notice,
terminate a tenancy if the landlord in good faith requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation for a period of at least one year by,
 
(c) a child
or parent of the landlord
or the landlord’s spouse. [emphasis added]
7.    
In Feeney v. Noble,
1994 CanLII 10538 (ON SC), the Court held that the test of good faith is
genuine intention to occupy the premises and not the reasonableness of the
Landlord’s proposal. This principle was upheld in Salter v. Beljinac 2001
CanLII 40231 (ON SCDC), where
the Court held that the “good faith” requirement simply means that the Landlord
sincerely intends to occupy the rental unit. The Landlord may also have
additional motives for selecting a particular rental
unit, but this does not affect the good
faith of the Landlord’s notice.”
 
8.    
In the more recent case
of Fava v. Harrison, [2014] O.J No. 2678 ONSC 3352 (Ont.Div.Ct.) the
Court determined that while the motives of the Landlord are, per Salter,
“largely irrelevant”, the Board can consider the conduct and motives of the
Landlord to draw inferences as to whether
the Landlord desires,
in good faith to occupy the property.”
 
9.    
Based on the
uncontested evidence of the Landlord, we are satisfied on a balance of
probabilities that Jacob Zeinstra,
the son of the Landlord, genuinely intends to move into the rental
unit. The Landlord’s evidence was unchallenged, credible, and consistent with the affidavit filed by the Landlord’s son.
 
10.  Therefore,
we find that the Landlord in good faith requires
possession of the rental unit for
the purposes of residential occupation for a period of at least one year.
 
11.  We accept the Landlord’s uncontested testimony that the landlord has waived
the rent for July 2021 and has thus complied with his obligation under
section 48. 1 of the Act to pay the Tenant compensation equal to one month’s
rent.
 
12.  The Tenant was not present
at the hearing to dispute
the Landlord’s evidence or provide
evidence or submissions for the Board with respect to relief from eviction.




 
13.  We have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
January 22, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 22, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 22, 2022, then starting
January 23, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
3.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 23, 2022.
