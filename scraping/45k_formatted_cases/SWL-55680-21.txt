Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: SWL-55680-21
 



In the
  matter of:


A, 15 BARWICK STREET ST.THOMAS ON N5P1Z6


 




Between:


Dennis Catt


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Chantelle Butler
  Dan Hepburn


Tenants



 
Dennis Catt (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dan Hepburn
and Chantelle Butler (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent
that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 20, 2022. Only the Landlord
attended the hearing. As of 10:36 a.m., the Tenants were not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 20, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $2,200.00.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,100.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from July 1, 2021 to
September 20, 2021.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenants,
and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 8, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $9,749.23*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 28, 2022, less
the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$72.33 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 29, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or
before February 8, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 9,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 8, 2022, then starting
February 9, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 9, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)          
$11,186.00 if the payment is made on or before
January 31, 2022,
or
ii)         
$13,386.00 if the payment is made on or before
February 8, 2022**.
If the
Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 9, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
