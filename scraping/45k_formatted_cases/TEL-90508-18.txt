O.C. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict M.R. and J.S. (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on May 23, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord’s niece, A.M.,
attended the hearing.
 
Preliminary Issue:
 
1.    On the morning of the hearing, a Tenant appeared
in the hearing room twice because she was confused regarding where she was
supposed to be. I advised her that all Tenants should report to the other
hearing room as all contested matters were scheduled to be heard in that room. 
2.    The Tenant then informed me that she wished to
speak to duty counsel and she had put her name on the list for duty counsel. I
then advised her to wait in the lobby until duty counsel called her name.  
3.    After the morning hearing block concluded, it
came to my attention that the Tenant I was speaking to was actually the
first-named Tenant in this matter. As the Tenant failed to identify herself in
the hearing room when she spoke to me and failed to sign the hearing attendance
sheet, this matter proceeded as an uncontested matter. 
Determinations:
4.    The Tenants have not paid the total rent they
were required to pay for the period from January 1, 2016 to May 31, 2018. 
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
April 3, 2018.
5.    The outstanding arrears owing for the period
ending May 31, 2018, total $6,441.00. 
6.    The Landlord paid $175.00 for the costs of
filing the application and the Landlord is entitled to be reimbursed for those
costs. 
7.    The Landlord collected a rent deposit of
$1,633.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlord.
8.    Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenants for the period from January 1, 2018 to April 3, 2018.
9.    The Tenants paid $3,100.00 after the application
was filed.
10. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before June 4,
2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $4,433.76*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to May 24, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $53.69 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
May 25, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 4, 2018, the Tenants will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June 5,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 4, 2018, then starting June 5, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 5, 2018.
8.     
If the Tenants wish to void
this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust:
i)        $6,616.00 if the payment is made on or before May 31, 2018, or
ii)       $8,249.00 if the payment is made on or before June 4, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after June 5, 2018
but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
