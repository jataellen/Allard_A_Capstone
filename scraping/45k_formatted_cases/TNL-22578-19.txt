Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-22578-19
 











 
 
 
 
 
 

AP I LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict ML and SGF(the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on February 27,
2020.
 
The Landlord’s representative, NM
and the Tenant, (ML) attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from October 1,
2019 to February 29, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a
Notice of Termination effective November 25, 2019.
2.     
The monthly rent as of the
date of the hearing is $1,560.42. 
3.     
The Tenants paid $1,825.44
after the application was filed.
4.     
There was no dispute that
the Tenants owe to the Landlord the amount of $4,601.66, which represents the
arrears of rent to February 29, 2020 and the application filing fee.
5.     
It was the evidence of
Tenant, ML that on September 14, 2019 she was involved in a car accident and
stopped going to school in December 2019. As a result, her benefits from the (OSAP)
were stopped. 
6.     
The Tenants have lived in
the unit since September 2016. ML lives in the unit with her husband and two
young children. ML receives a monthly child tax benefit of $1,240.00 and when
her husband works, he has a monthly income of around $3,000.00. 
7.     
The Tenants requested relief
and ML stated that she can pay $2,000.00 on March 2, 2020 which would be for
the March 2020 rent and the arrears. Thereafter, she can pay the monthly rent
when due and $500.00 towards the arrears until the arrears are paid in full. 
8.     
ML also stated that she is
due to return to school on May 15, 2020 and expects to receive $23,4000.00 from
OSAP and intends to pay off all the arrears.
9.     
The Landlord opposed any
relief and the payment plan. The Landlord submitted that ML’s spouse had an
income but the full rent was not paid. The Landlord also submitted that the
length of the payment plan is prejudicial to the Landlord. 
10.  
ML explained that her spouse
does not work full time because he does not have status; and has not worked regularly
due to the weather, as he is a labourer.  There are times when his income is
around $500.00, but she could not state for what months her spouse received
this amount.
11.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. I considered that the
Act is remedial and will give the Tenants and opportunity to continue the
tenancy by paying the arrears and the rent according to ML’s plan. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Tenants shall pay the
Landlord $4,601.66, which represents the arrears of rent owing up to February
29, 2020 ($4,426.66), plus the Landlord’s application filing fee ($175.00).
2.     
The Tenants shall pay the
amount set out in paragraph 1, above, according to the following schedule:
                                    On or before March 6,
2020                       $ 2,000.00 (March rent & $439.58 arrears)
                                    On or before April 1,
2020                          $ 500.00  
                                    On or before May 1,
2020                           $ 500.00  
                                    On or before June 1,
2020                         $ 500.00  
                                    On or before July 1,
2020                           $ 500.00  
                                    On or before August 1,
2020                     $ 500.00  
                                    On or before September
1, 2020               $ 500.00  
                                    On or before October 1,
2020                    $ 500.00  
                                    On or before November
1, 2020                $ 500.00  
                                    On or before December
1, 2020                $ 162.08   
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
the monthly rent as it comes due on or before April 1, 2020, May 1, 2020, June
1, 2020, July 1, 2020, August 1, 2020, September 1, 2020, October 1, 2020,
November 1, 2020, and December 1, 2020.
4.     
If the Tenants fail to make the
payments under paragraph 2, above, in full, the Landlord may collect the entire
outstanding balance from the amount set out in paragraph 1, above, immediately.

5.     
If the Tenants fail to make
payments under paragraphs 2, or 3, above, in full and on time, the Landlord may
apply under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (‘the
Act’) within 30 days of the breach, without notice to the Tenants, for an order
terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants; and requiring that the Tenants
pay any new arrears and NSF fees and related charges that become owing after
February 29, 2020.
