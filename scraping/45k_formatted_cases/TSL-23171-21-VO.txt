Darlene Jones


Tenant



 
 
On November 15, 2021 the Board
issued order TSL-23171-21 terminating the tenancy and evicting Darlene
Jones (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant failed to pay rent that the Tenant owes.
 
On December 30, 2021 the Tenant filed
a motion to void order TSL-23171-21 because after the eviction order became
enforceable, the Tenant paid Havcare Investments Inc (the 'Landlord' the amount required to void
the order under subsection 74(11) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act').
 
The motion was heard by videoconference on February 10, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s agent, Carolyn
Kribbs and the Tenant attended
the hearing. The Tenant
was represented by Karly Wilson.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant filed an affidavit
swearing that the Tenant paid the full amount required to void order TSL-23171-21 to the Landlord
before the eviction
order became enforceable.
 
2.    
The Tenant has not previously made a motion
under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside an eviction order during the
period of the Tenant’s tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
3.     The order issued
on November 16, 2021 required the Tenant to pay $2,461.23 on or before December
15, 2021 to void the order.
 
4.     The Tenant’s affidavit states payments were made to the Landlord
via cheque after
the order’s enforceable date totalling $2,494.04.
 
5.     At the hearing,
the Landlord confirmed the receipt of these payments and confirmed that the
Landlord had not incurred court enforcement costs.
 
6.     The Tenant appeared
to be in a credit
balance of $32.81
as of December 30, 2021.

7.    
Based on the evidence before the
Board, I find that the Tenant has voided the order dated November 16, 2021 at the time she filed her motion to void and thus, the motion
to void the order must be granted.
 
8.     This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The motion to void order
TSL-23171-21 issued on November 16, 2021 is granted.
 
2.     Order TSL-23171-21 is void and cannot be enforced by the Landlord.
