Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-89165-18
 











 
 
 

T. A. and R. A. (the 'Landlords') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict S. H. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did
not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. (L1 application)
 
T. A. and R. A. (the 'Landlords') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict S. H. (the 'Tenant') because he, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone he permitted in the residential complex
has:
(1)  wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises, and 
(2)  substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlords or another tenant 
 
The Landlords has also applied for an order requiring
the Tenant to compensate the Landlords for the damage (L2 application)
 
This application was heard in Toronto on May 10, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord and the
Landlord’s representative, M. J., attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 application
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent he was required to pay for the period from January 1, 2018 to May
31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination
effective March 1, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant has not paid any
rental arrears since the application was filed.
3.     
There is no last month’s
rent deposit.
4.     
The Landlords also request
reimbursement for the filing fee in the amount of $190 bringing the total
arrears in this application to $5190.00.
5.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
L2 Application
6.     
The Tenant was given a first
Notice of Termination under section 64 of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2016 (the ‘Act’). The termination date was February 16, 2018. The notice
cites the Tenant’s failure to allow the Landlord access to the electrical room
to check the wiring associated with an emergency power loss. It also sets out the
Tenant’s failure to pay the portion of the utility bills that he is responsible
pursuant to the lease agreement. This notice was not voided.
7.     
The Landlords gave a second
Notice of Termination, served on February 14, 2018 with a termination date of
March 1, 2018. The second notice sets out the issue of overcrowding in
contravention of the lease agreement; non-payment of utility bills;
interference with access to the basement for repairs and maintenance and unpaid
rent.
8.     
Based on the uncontested
evidence before the Board, I am satisfied that the Tenant has substantially
interfered with the Landlord’s lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlord.  
9.     
The Tenant has failed to pay
the Hydro and Enbridge Bills as required under the lease agreement. The Landlord
has provided a copy of the lease agreement along with copies of the Toronto
Hydro Bills and Enbridge Bill as supporting evidence at the hearing.
10.   The Tenant owes $539.70 for Hydro and $436.40
for Enbridge for the period of November 2017 to April 2018. The Landlord has
repeatedly asked the Tenant to pay his bills but he has failed to do so.
11.   The Landlords provided a copy of the Lease
Agreement signed by the Tenants and Landlord, along with copies of the
outstanding Utility Bills for March and July 2017. The Landlords also provided convincing
evidence of attempts to contact the tenant and in an effort to resolve the
outstanding amounts owing. All documents were entered as Exhibits at the
hearing.
12.   The Landlord testified that he had to pay all of
the Tenants’ outstanding utility bills in order to preserve his name and keep
his property secured. He has suffered significant financial impairment from the
tenants’ failure to comply with the terms of the lease and tenancy.
13.  
The Tenant or a person
permitted in the residential complex by the Tenant has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit by
damaging the basement drywall and the shower glass sliding door. The
uncontested evidence of the Landlord was provided at the hearing. I find that
the damage is not due to normal wear and tear.
 
14.  
The Landlords will incur the
costs of $850.00 to repair the damage. 
 
15.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
