Homestead Land Holdings Limited
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Nadiya Maslova (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 18, 2022. Only
the Landlord's Legal Representative, Briar Hurst,
attended the hearing.
As of 9:56 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to November
30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 30, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on November
30, 2021. The Tenant was in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.      The lawful monthly
rent was $923.57.
 
4.      The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $857.82 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period from
December 20, 2020 to September 30,
2021.

The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
