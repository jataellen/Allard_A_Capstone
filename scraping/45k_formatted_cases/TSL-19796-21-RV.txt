Review Order
 
 
Nidhan Grewal
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Amy
Zuchetto (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was resolved by order TSL-19796-21 issued on December
7, 2021.
 
On January 4,
2022, the Landlord requested a review of the order and that the order be stayed
until the request to review the order is resolved.
 
On January 7,
2022, interim order TSL-19796-21 -IN was issued, staying the order issued on
December 7, 2022. The Landlord alleged that they were not reasonably able to
participate in the proceeding.
 
The request
was heard by video conference on January 25, 2022. Only the Landlord attended the hearing. As of 9:47 a.m., the Tenant was not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
The Request
 
1.     The Landlord alleged that they were not reasonably
able to participate in the original proceedings of June 2, 2021, which resulted
in order TSL-19796-21 dismissing the Landlord’s application.




 
2.    
In support of the request to
review the order, the Landlord stated
that they did not receive the Notice of Hearing in the mail and had to contact
the Board to get an update on the file.
 
3.    
The records show
that on November 9, 2021, the Landlord did send an email to the Board requesting an update on the issuance
of the order as he was unable to attend the hearing and needed to file a review
request. Although the Notice of Hearing was sent by email to the Landlord on
April 1, 2021, I have no reason to find the Landlord’s evidence misleading.
4.    
Based on the
uncontested submissions made in the request, I am satisfied that the Landlord
was not reasonably able to participate in the proceedings. Therefore, the
Landlord’s application was heard afresh.
The L1 Application
 
5.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period from April 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective January 12, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenant vacated the rental unit on February 28,
2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date the
application was filed.
 
7.    
The lawful monthly rent is $2,100.00.
 
8.    
The Tenant made no payments after the application was filed.
 
9.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $2,150.00
from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
10.  Interest on
the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from November 30, 2016
to January 12, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The request to review order TSL-19796-21 issued on
December 7, 2021 is granted. The order cannot be enforced.
 
2.    
The interim order issued
on January 7, 2022 is cancelled and replaced with this order.
 
3.     The tenancy is terminated as of February 28, 2021, the
date the Tenant gave vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
4.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $15,656.03*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February 28,
2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
5.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.




 
 
 
6.    
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March 2, 2021, the Tenant will
start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 3,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
