Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57435-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1107, 59 CONCESSION STREET CAMBRIDGE ON N1R5Z6


 




Between:


Galaxy Value Add Ont. Properties LP


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Cheryl
Treige


Tenant



 
 
 
Galaxy Value Add
Ont. Properties LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Cheryl Treige (the 'Tenant') and for an order to
have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because
the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified in the order
issued by the Board on
October 28, 2021 with respect to application SWL-52580-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant
has not met the following condition specified in the order: the Tenant did not pay the lawful
rent for December
plus $585.00 on or
before December 1, 2021.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $7,611.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's
application fee in Order SWL-52580-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $6,441.00
and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous
order SWL-52580-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed
to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from October 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.




 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,485.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from February 18, 2021
to January 14, 2022.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The previous
order SWL-52580-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 25, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$6,441.00*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to December 31, 2021 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$48.82 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
25, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 25, 2022, then starting January
26, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 26, 2022.

The tenant has until January 24, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 24, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.




 
In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on July 26, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction
where the rental unit is located.
