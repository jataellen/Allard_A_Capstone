File Number: TNL-33872-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1005, 15 KING
STREET YORK ON M9N3X1


 




Between:


Central King
Seniors Residence


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Ronald Keneth Jones


Tenant



 
 
 
Central King Seniors Residence (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Ronald Keneth Jones (the
'Tenant') because:
 
1)    
the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlord or another tenant (N5 notice).
 
2)     The Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or
someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully
caused undue damage
to the rental unit or the residential
complex (N7 notice).
 
This application was heard by
way of video conference on November 18, 2021.
The Landlord’s Agent Bardha Oka and Bob Putnam, president of the
corporation attended the hearing. The
Tenant did not attend the hearing despite
being served with the Notice of Hearing and there
is no record of an adjournment
request.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    The Landlord’s application is based on two N5 notices. The first N5 was served to the
Tenant on February 8, 2021 with a termination date of February
28, 2021. The Landlord’s
second N5 notice was served to the Tenant on April 1, 2021 with a termination
date of April 16, 2021. Both N5 notices allege substantial interference with reasonable enjoyment.
 
2.    The Landlord’s application is also based on an N7 notice of termination served
to the Tenant on July 27,
2021 with a termination date of August 8, 2021.
 
N5 notice:
 
3.    Section 69 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the Act)
states:




 
69 (1) A landlord may apply to the Board for an order terminating a tenancy and evicting
the tenant if the landlord has given notice to terminate the tenancy
under this Act or the Tenant Protection Act, 1997.
 
(2) An application under subsection (1) may not be made later than 30 days after
the termination date specified in the notice.
 
4.   
The Landlord’s L2 application was filed on August 4, 2021. As such,
the Landlord was not entitled to file the N5 notice
pursuant to section
69(2) of the Act as more than 30
days had passed since the
termination date on both N5 notices.
 
5.   
As such, I cannot
consider the Landlord’s evidence regarding the allegations plead
on the N5 notice.
 
 
N7 Notice:
 
6.   
The Landlord’s L2 application was filed less than 30 days after the N7 termination date of August 8,
2021. Therefore, the merits of the N7 notice can be considered by the Board.
 
Landlord’s evidence:
 
7.   
The Landlord’s Agent Bardha Oka provided
oral testimony at the hearing.
Ms. Oka is the Property
Manager of the residential complex. The
residential complex is a high-rise apartment building.
 
8.    On June 13, 2021, the Landlord’s superintendent
observed water coming from the Tenant’s rental unit and flowing into the
hallway. The Landlord’s Agent entered
the rental unit and determined that the water leakage was as a result of the kitchen
sink overflowing.
 
9.   
On July 23, 2021 the Landlord’s superintendent again observed
water flowing from the
Tenants rental unit and into the hallway of the residential complex. The Landlord’s Agent entered the rental unit and observed that the kitchen
sink was again overflowing.
 
10. On July 25, 2021 the Landlord’s President and Agent
observed water flowing from the Tenant’s rental unit and into the hallway. The Landlord’s Agent testified that the water leakage was coming from the P-Trap
pipe under the kitchen sink.
 
Analysis:
 
11. The Landlord’s N7 notice is based on the allegation that the Tenant
has wilfully caused damages to the rental unit or
residential complex. The notice was
served pursuant to section 63(1) of the Act which states in part:
 
63 (1) Despite
section 62, a landlord may give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy
that provides a termination date not earlier than the 10th day after the notice is given if the tenant,
another occupant of the rental
unit or a person whom the tenant permits in the residential
complex,




 
 
 
(a)    
wilfully causes undue damage to the rental
unit or the residential complex [emphasis added]
 
12. Based on the evidence before the Board I am not satisfied
on a balance of probabilities that the Tenant has Tenant has wilfully caused damages to the rental
unit or residential complex.
 
13. Although I accept the Landlord’s uncontested evidence
that on at least three occasions water leakage and flooding occurred in the rental unit, the Landlord
provided no evidence to support that the water leaks
or floods were wilfully caused by the Tenant.
More specially, there is no evidence
that the Tenant deliberately caused the sink to overflow or deliberately sought to cause damage.
The fact that that water overflowed from the
Tenant’s unit on three occasions is not sufficient, in an of itself, to establish that this
was likely done wilfully by the Tenant.
 
14. While the evidence before the Board may establish that
the Tenant was negligent or carless in not reporting to the Landlord that his
kitchen sink was leaking or overflowing, the
Landlord did not serve an N5 notice
of termination under section 62 of the Act
alleging that the Tenant negligently caused undue damage .
 
15. As the Landlord
was unable to prove the Tenant’s conduct
was willful, the Landlord’s application must be dismissed.
 
16. This Order contains
all the reasons for this matter. No further reasons
will issue.
 
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
