In the matter
of:


10, 88 KING EDWARD
AVENUE LONDON ON N5Z3S8


 




Between:


King Edward
Apartments


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Frankie Wilkinson


Tenant



 
 
 
King Edward Apartments (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Frankie Wilkinson (the 'Tenant'). The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit
after the termination date.
 
This application
was heard via video conference on January 10, 2022. Only the Landlord’s representative, Kasandra Jang attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The tenancy for this rental
unit commenced on February 1, 2020.
 
2.     On August 20, 2021, the Landlord served the Tenant
with the first Notice to End Your Tenancy for interfering with Others, Damage
or Overcrowding (N5) with a termination date
of September 9, 2021. The Landlord alleged
in the notice that on July
2, 2021, the Tenant denied entry into the rental
unit for pest control treatment despite a Notice of Entry being served on the
Tenant on June 29, 2021.
 
3.    
The Landlord’s representative
testified that on August 5, 2021, the Tenant again denied entry to the Landlord
and their agents even though a Notice of Entry was given on July 30, 2021. The Landlord’s representative testified that the Tenant
used vulgar, derogatory language towards the
Landlord’s contractor and representative.
 
4.     Section 64(3) of the
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 provides that the first N5 is voided
if within seven days after receiving the notice, stops the conduct or activity
or corrects the omission complained about. In
this case, the N5 was served on August 20, 2021, which means the seven day
voiding period ran from August 21, 2021 to August 27, 2021.




 
5.    
The second N5 Notice was served
September 7, 2021 with a termination date of September 21, 2021. The Landlord alleged
in the notice that on September 4, 2021 the Tenant denied entry to the Landlord
and their agents for pest control treatment even though a Notice of Entry was
given on August 31, 2021. The Landlord’s representative also stated that the Tenant used vulgar language
towards the Landlord’s contractor and representative.
 
6.     Subsection 68 of the Act sets out the requirements for service of a second N5 notice:
 
(1)  
A
landlord may give a
notice of termination of tenancy if,
 
(a)  
a
notice of termination was given to the tenant under section 62, 64 or 67;
and
 
(b)  
more than seven days but less than six months after the notice
mentioned in clause (a) was given to the tenant, an activity takes
place, conduct occurs or a situation arises
that constitutes grounds for a
notice of termination under section 61, 61,
62, 64 or 67, other than an activity, conduct or situation that is described
in subsection 61(1) and that involves an illegal act, trade, business
or occupation described in clause 61(2)(a).
 
(2)  
the notice under this section shall set out the date it is to be effective and that
date shall not be earlier than the 14th day after
the notice is given.
 
7.    
The Landlord’s representative testified
that they tried to access the Tenant’s rental
unit to treat for pests and
address a pest infestation in the rental complex.
 
8.     The Landlord submitted into evidence the notices of
entry dated June 29, July 30 and
August 31, 2021. The Landlord’s representative stated that they
were not allowed access into
the unit. I find that the notices of
entry were proper notices under the Act.
 
9.     Section 27(1) of the Act provides that a
landlord may enter a rental unit in accordance with written notice given to the
tenant at least 24 hours before the time of entry. Based on all the evidence, the Tenant having being served with
several notices of entry, prevented the Landlord or their agents from going
into the unit. Therefore, I find that
the Tenant has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord.
 
10. 
The Landlord’s representative testified that the Tenant
did provide entry to the unit to the
Landlord on October 7th and November 25, 2021 but pest control
treatment was not completed as no preparation was completed by the Tenant.
 
11.  The Landlord’s representative requested that the tenancy be terminated.
 
12.  Based on the uncontested evidence at the hearing, I
find that the Tenant has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest




 
of the Landlord because
the Tenant has failed to allow the Landlord access to the unit,
despite proper notice of entry.
 
13.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. I
considered that the Tenant did allow entries in October and November, 2021.    As
the Act is a remedial legislation, the tenancy will continue subject to the
conditions below.
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.     The Tenant shall permit the Landlord to enter the rental unit pursuant to a valid notice of entry served pursuant to section 27 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006.
 
2.     If the purpose for entry by the Landlord is for pest
control treatment, the Tenant shall prepare
the rental unit in advance
of any pest control treatment in accordance with the
written instructions received with the notice of entry.
 
3.     The Tenant shall not make vulgar or derogatory
comments to the Landlord, the Landlord’s staff or other representatives in the residential complex
for a period of no less
than twelve months, commencing the date of this order.
 
4.     If the Tenant fails
to comply with the conditions set out in paragraphs 1, 2 or 3 above,
then, within 30 days of the breach, the Landlord may apply under section 78 of
the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a
breach of a condition as set out in paragraph 1 above.
