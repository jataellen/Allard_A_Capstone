File Number: EAL-97706-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


406, 300
WIGGINS PRIVATE OTTAWA ON
  K1N1B2


 




Between:


Ottawa Community Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Wendy Fournier


Tenant



 
 
 
Ottawa Community Housing
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Wendy Fournier (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 11, 2022. Only the Landlord’s representative, D. Dawson,
attended the hearing. Determinations:
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period from
December 1, 2020, to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective January
1, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant paid $1,858.00
after the application was filed.
 
3.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including the impact of the pandemic and whether the
Landlord attempted to negotiate a payment plan, and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 5, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$5,122.02*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 22, 2022.




File Number: EAL-97706-21
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$29.85 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 23, 2022, to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before March 5, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 6,
2022, at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 5, 2022, then starting
March 6, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 6, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$5,541.97 if the payment
is made on or before February 28, 2022, or
ii)             
$6,449.97 if the payment
is made on or before March 5,
2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after March
6, 2022, but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
