In the matter
of:


5, 25 MACDONALD STREET ETOBICOKE ON M8V1Y3


 




Between:


Carmela Valvano


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


William J. Evans


Tenant



 
 
 
Carmela Valvano (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict William
J. Evans (the
'Tenants') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered
with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlord or another tenant and because the Tenant
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 1, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s Agent, Mario Valvano, and the Tenant,
William J. Evans,
attended the hearing.
 
At the
hearing, I raised the preliminary issue with respect to the allegations
included in the N5 Notice of Termination (‘the Notice’). The allegations in the Notice stated only “A strong odour coming
from apartment” and three dates.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     According to the Ontario Divisional Court’s decisions
in both Kuzyk v. S.K. Properties[1] and Ball v. Metro Capital
Property and Lockhurst,[2] if a Notice of termination issued by a
Landlord is confusing to the degree that a reasonable person could not
understand the precise actions or omissions that caused the Landlord to pursue
eviction, a Member would find it defective. Specifically,
the Court in Ball stated that “particulars should include dates and times of
the alleged offensive conduct, together with a detailed description of the
alleged conduct engaged in by the tenant.”
 
2.     I find that the Notice is lacking the particulars to
which a reasonable person would understand the allegations against them,
therefore the Notice is found to be defective.

3.     The Landlord requested the consent of the Board to
withdraw their application and in accordance with subsection 200(4) of the Act,
I consent to the withdrawal of the application.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord's application is dismissed without
prejudice.
