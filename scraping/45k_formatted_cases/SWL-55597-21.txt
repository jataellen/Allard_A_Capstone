Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55597-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


28, 352
PATRICIA AVENUE KITCHENER
  ON N2M1K1


 




Between:


Starlight Canadian Residential Growth Fund


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


David Hesch


Tenant



 
 
 
Starlight Canadian Residential Growth Fund (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict David Hesch (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did
not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 20, 2022. Only
the Landlord's Legal Representative, Stephanie Lauersen, attended the hearing. The Tenant had signed in for the hearing but was not present or represented at the hearing
when the application was called at 2:57
p.m..
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period
from June 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective July 14,
2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $667.92
as of January 1, 2022.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $667.92 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit has been paid to the Tenant for the period
from May 30, 2021 to December 31, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $2,640.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the




 
Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 20, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$1,517.63*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 9, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$21.96 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 10, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 20, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 21, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 20, 2022, then starting February
21, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 21, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before February 20,
2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $2,841.84** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 21, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 

February 9, 2022 Date Issued
 
South West-RO
150 Dufferin Avenue, Suite
400, 4th Floor London ON N6A5N6
