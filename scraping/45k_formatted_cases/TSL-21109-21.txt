Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number:
TSL-21109-21




 
In the matter
  of:


 
1103, 3845 LAKESHORE BOULEVARD W
  ETOBICOKE ON M8W4Y3


 




Between:


Jie Zhang


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Timothy Macinnis


Tenant



 
 
 
Jie Zhang (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Timothy Macinnis (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for
each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard
by video conference on July 13, 2021, beginning
at 9:00 a.m..
 
The Landlord and the Landlord's Legal
Representative Jian Hong Guan attended
the hearing. As of 10:00 a.m., the Tenant was not presented
or represented at this hearing although properly served with a notice of this
hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Landlord seeks an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because
the Tenant, an occupant of the rental unit or a guest substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlord.
 
2.       
On March 1, 2021 the Landlord
served a voidable
N5 Notice to End Your Tenancy
with a termination date of
March 22, 2021. The Notice alleges that at the end of December 2020, “all sorts
of creepy late night activities” were going on in the Tenant’s unit. The police
attended to investigate.
 
3.       
Then, on January 13, 2021, someone
in the Tenant’s unit threw cigarette butts and trash from the balcony to the property
below. The Landlord also claims that, on January 23, 2021, the Tenant and his
guest were observed not wearing face coverings, and the Tenant changed the
locks to the unit without the Landlord’s permission.




 
4.       
The Landlord’s property manager
G. M. informed the Tenant
of the balcony incident on January 13, 2021, by letter on the same day and asked the Tenant to immediately stop the behaviour.
 
5.       
On May 25, 2021, G.M. sent an
email to the Tenant advising him that he observed the Tenant continuing to throw items from the balcony, including
a pill which appeared to be a street drug. G.M. told the Tenant that
he had taken photographs of this conduct. This evidence supports the Landlord’s
assertions that the Tenant did not void the N5 Notice.
 
6.       
I
am satisfied on the evidence
before me that the Tenant,
occupants of the unit or the
Tenant’s guests have substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of
the Landlord.
 
7.       
At the hearing, the Landlord
requested an order for $3,000.00 as compensation for damages. This claim and remedy were not set out in the L2 application, and neither were descriptions of the damages claimed.
 
8.       
In Beauge v. Metcap
Living Management Inc., [2012] O.J. No. 1052 (Div. Ct.), the Divisional
Court ruled that the Board’s jurisdiction to grant remedies is limited to only
those remedies claimed in an application. Therefore, although the Landlord
requested an order requiring the Tenant to pay for undue damages
he alleged caused,
the Board lacks jurisdiction to grant this remedy.
 
9.       
The tenancy was terminated by
Order TSL-18574-20, issued on July 28, 2021, on the basis of an L1 application for arrears. Given that the tenancy has been
terminated by way of order, no other remedy is applicable.
 
10.    The Landlord has incurred the cost of $186.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
On or by February
28, 2022 the Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
2.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before February
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
