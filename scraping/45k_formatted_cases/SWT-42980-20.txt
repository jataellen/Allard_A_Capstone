Order under
Section 31
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006


 




 


File Number:
SWT-42980-20




 
In the matter
of:


 
88 BRUBACHER STREET KITCHENER ON N2T2W2


 




Between:


Jason Van Belle


Tenant




 


 
and


 




 


Casey
Deveau


Landlord



 
 
 
Jason Van Belle
(the 'Tenant') applied for an order determining that Casey Deveau (the
'Landlord') harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with the Tenant,
entered the rental unit
illegally and altered the locking system on a door giving entry to the rental
unit or residential complex without giving the Tenant replacement keys.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 4,
2021.
 
Only the Tenant
attended the hearing. As of 9:45 a.m., the Landlord was not present or
represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant testified
that on February 12, 2020, the Landlord entered his rental unit without notice
and began accusing him of viewing child pornography. The Landlord then forced
the Tenant out of the residential
complex and changed the locks. The Tenant has not been back to the rental
unit since. The Landlord threw away the Tenant’s belongings, and would not give back his
TV, 2 laptop computers, and cellphone.
 
2.    
Based on the uncontested evidence of the Tenant, I find that the Landlord
obstructed and interfered with
the Tenant, entered the rental unit illegally and altered the locking system on
a door giving entry to the rental unit or residential complex without giving
the Tenant replacement keys.
 
3.    
I find that the Tenant moved
out of the rental unit because of the Landlord's actions.
 
Remedy
 
4.    
The Tenant requests a
rent abatement for half the month of February 2020 and 100 percent for the month of March
2020. The monthly
rent was $750.00.
Tenant testified that he had paid rent up to the period
ending March 31, 2020. As the Tenant did
not have use




File Number: SWT-42980-20
 
of the rental unit from February
12, I find that he is entitled
to a rent abatement of
$1,125.00.
 
5.    
The Tenant also requested
replacement costs for two laptop computers and a cellphone. However, the Tenant did not provide
any invoices or receipts to substantiate these costs.
Therefore, the request is denied.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord
shall pay to the Tenant
$1,125.00. This represents the rent abatement for half the month of February 2020 and the entire month of
March 2020.
 
2.    
The Landlord
shall also pay to the Tenant $50.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
3.    
The total
amount the Landlord
owes is $1,175.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
shall pay the Tenant the full amount
owing by January
24, 2022.
 
5.    
If the Landlord does
not pay the Tenant the full amount owing by January 24, 2022, the Tenant will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January
25, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
The Landlord
shall immediately return to the Tenant
any of the Tenant’s belongings that are still in possession of the Landlord.
 
7.    
The Tenant
has the right,
at any time, to collect
the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
