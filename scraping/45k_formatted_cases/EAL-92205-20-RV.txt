Review Order
 
Torbill Holdings Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Lauren Lambert (LL) and Kyle Donnelly
(KD) (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe.
 
This application was resolved by order EAL-92205-20 issued on June 1, 2021.
On November 4, 2021, the Tenant LL requested a review of the order.
The request was heard by videoconference on January 21, 2022.
 
Only the Tenant LL and the Tenant LL’s legal representative T. Oulton attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Review
 
1.     The Tenant LL’s request for a review
is based on the ground of being not reasonably able to participate in the proceedings.
 
2.     The hearing that gave rise to the order under
review took place on April 27, 2021.
Neither of the Tenants attended.
 
3.     At the review hearing LL testified that she received
no notice of the hearing.
LL testified that she learned
about the hearing when the Landlord contacted LL afterward and told her that
she would be evicted.




File Number: EAL-92205-20-RV
 
4.    
The Board’s records show that the
Notice of Hearing for the hearing held on April 27, 2021 was only sent to the Tenant KD by email.
No Notice of Hearing was sent to LL by any means.
 
5.     Based on LL’s uncontested
evidence and the Board’s records, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that
the Tenant LL was not reasonably able to participate in the proceedings. At the hearing
I granted LL’s request for a review
and the Landlord’s L1 application was heard de novo.
 
L1 application
 
6.    
Since the Landlord did not appear at the hearing to support the application, I find that this
application has been abandoned.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     Order EAL-92205-20 issued
on May 28, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the following:
 
2.     The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
