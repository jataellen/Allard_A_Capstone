Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-54529-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1 BEDROOM, 56315
HERITAGE LINE STRAFFORDVILLE
  ON N0J1V0


 




Between:


Rudy Leenaerts


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Laura Beaulieu


Tenant



 
 
 
Rudy Leenaerts
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Laura
Beaulieu (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit
or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another tenant.
 
This application was heard via videoconference
on January 10, 2022. Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
As of 10:47 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented although
properly served a notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    The Landlord testified that the Tenant
vacated the unit on November
1, 2021. As the Tenant has vacated the unit,
there is no need to consider the merits of the Landlord’s application to evict
the Tenant. The Landlord’s application is moot.
 
2.   
The Landlord was seeking
compensation for utilities. The Landlord’s application did not request
compensation for damages pursuant to section 88.2 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’), and therefore, I could not consider his
request. At the hearing, the Landlord was informed
that he may wish to contact Legal Aid Ontario
to get legal advice for filing an application in this regard.
The Landlord may wish to call 1-800-730-3218.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord's application is dismissed.
