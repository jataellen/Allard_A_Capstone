Capreit
Limited Partnership (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Robee Sebastian
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes. The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges and related administration
charges.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 24, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Nidhi Sharma, attended the hearing. As of 10:02 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
30, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
November 22, 2021. The Tenant
was in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,700.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
6.    
The Landlord incurred charges
of $20.00 for cheques tendered
by or on behalf of the
Tenant, which were returned NSF and $80.00 for related administration charges.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
November 22, 2021. The Tenant
was in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.
