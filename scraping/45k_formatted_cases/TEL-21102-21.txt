Tenants




 
 
On November 16, 2021, Andreas
Andriopoulos (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Erika Lynn Shank, Nicole Shank and Nickolas Tsoutsoulas (the 'Tenants')
and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a
condition specified in the order issued by the Board
on August 4, 2021 with respect to application
TEL-15954-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenants have not met the following condition(s) specified in the order:
 
The Tenants failed
to pay to the landlord
$2,700.00 on or before November
1, 2021 towards rent.
 
3.       
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenants were ordered to pay
$31,836.00 for rent arrears in Order TEL-15954-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $28,836.00 and that amount
is included in this order. As a result, the previous
order TEL-15954-21 is cancelled.
 
5.       
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,700.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.




File Number: TEL-21102-21
 
6.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenants for the period from May 1, 2019 to January 7, 2022.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.       
Order TEL-15954-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 18, 2022.
 
3.       
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $28,773.75*. This amount represents the rent owing up to November 30, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
4.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$88.77 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting December 1, 2021 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.       
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
18, 2022, the Tenants will
start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January
19, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 19, 2022.

The tenant has until January 17, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 17, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating

has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
