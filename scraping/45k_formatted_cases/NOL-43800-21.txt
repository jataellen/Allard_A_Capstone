Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-43800-21



In the matter
of:


2, 188 CHURCH STREET SAULT-STE-MARIE ON P6A3H5


 




Between:


Wolfgang Schwerdtfeger


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Antonio
  Butera


 
Tenant



 
 
Wolfgang Schwerdtfeger (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Antonio Butera (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 16, 2021. Only the Landlord's Agent, Claudia Lavoie, attended the hearing. The Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective August
19, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $810.00.
4.     The Tenant paid $1,620.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Tenant,
who moved into the rental unit in January 2021, receives financial assistance of $1,160.00 from the Ontario Disability Support
Program and proposed a plan to pay an additional $500.00 towards the arrears
each month. Given the Tenant’s income, the plan proposed by the Tenant is not
feasible.
 
6.    
The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $810.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
 
7.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until January 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection
83(1)(b) of the Act. Additional time
given to the Tenant to either secure alternative
accommodation or pay the outstanding amount.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the
Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before January 31, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $2,414.17*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 6, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay
to the Landlord $26.63 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 7, 2022 to the date the
Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 31, 2022, the
Tenant will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from February 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022, then starting February
1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord, on or after February 1, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 31, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $4,051.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after
February 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
