Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19556-21



In the matter
of:

  SCARBOROUGH ON M1K2M9


 




Between:


Stan Cappe
736923 Ontario Limited


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


 
Julie Trepanier


 
Tenant



 
 
Stan Cappe and 736923 Ontario
Limited (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Julie
Trepanier (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlords also
claimed NSF cheque charges and related administration charges.
 
This application was heard by video
conference on January
5, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord, Stan Cappe,
attended the hearing. As of 9:44 a.m. the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this
hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective August
26, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent as of January 1, 2022 is $1,158.14.
 
4.     The Tenant paid $4,802.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlords incurred
charges of $15.00
for a cheque tendered by or on behalf of the
Tenant, which was returned NSF and $10.00 for related administration charges.
 
6.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,100.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit has been paid to the Tenant up to December
31, 2020.

8.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in
accordance with section 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlords
attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 6, 2022.
 
2.     As of the date of this order,
the amount of the rent deposit
exceeds the arrears
of rent, compensation, and any
unpaid charges related to NSF cheques the Landlords are entitled to by
$287.32*.
 
3.     However, the Landlords
are authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount the Landlords owe the Tenant:
$38.06 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 27,
2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit, and
$186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.    
The Landlords or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a
result of this order.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 6, 2022, then starting February
7, 2022, the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 7, 2022.
 
7.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlords or to the Board in
trust:
i)   $1,144.82 if the payment is made on or before
January 31, 2022,
or
ii)   $2,302.96 if the payment is made on or before
February 6, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not
make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 7, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
