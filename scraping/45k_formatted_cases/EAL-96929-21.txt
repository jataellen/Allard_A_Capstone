Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-96929-21
 
 
In the matter
of:      B, 01 GIBSON
LANE
MORRISBURG ON K0C1X0
 




Between:                  Gerben Schaillee
Glenna Schaillee


Landlords




 
 
and
 




Jeannie Flaro
Robert Laplante


Tenants




 
 
 
Gerben Schaillee and Glenna Schaillee (the 'Landlords') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict
Robert Laplante and Jeannie Flaro (the 'Tenants') because the Landlords intend to demolish the rental unit. The Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 17, 2021. The Landlords, the Landlord's Legal Representative,
James Moak, and the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants
do not dispute that the Landlords require
the rental unit to be vacated in order to demolish it.
 
2.    
It is also not disputed that the Landlords have given the Tenants
3 months’ rent compensation as required by the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').
 
3.    
I am satisfied that the Landlords
have obtained the necessary permits
for this work.
 
4.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act and find that it would
not be unfair to postpone the eviction until January 31, 2022 pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
5.    
The Tenant, Robert
Plante, has vacated the rental unit. The Tenant, Jeannie Flaro, testified that she would
be undergoing surgery
on December 6, 2021 and
requested until March 31, 2022 to
move. The Tenant testified that he is on ODSP and has not had any success in
finding a new place. However, the Tenant has known for approximately 12 months
that the Landlords intend to demolish the rental unit and the length of the
proceedings has afforded her time to explore her options. The Landlords have
already

suffered
financial losses and may face potential liability from the township if the
residential complex is not demolished. Balancing the interests and
circumstances of the parties and considering that the enforcement of the order
may take some time, it would be unfair to delay the eviction
to March 31, 2022 (Peel
Non-Profit Housing v. McNamara,
[1990] O.J. No.364). However, I do find it appropriate in the circumstances to
postpone the eviction to January 31, 2022 to afford the Tenant additional time
to make alternate arrangements.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated, as of
January 31, 2022. The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before January 31, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlords $16.44
per day for compensation for the use of the unit from January 12, 2022 to
the date they move out of the unit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlords $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlords the full amount owing on or before January 31, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022, then starting February
1, 2022, the Landlords
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after February 1, 2022.
