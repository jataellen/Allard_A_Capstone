Jashim Uddin (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Charleen Mitchell (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 6, 2022. The Landlord’s Agent, Cynthia Woodhouse and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period
from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 18, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The monthly
rent is $1,195.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant
paid all arrears
for the period ending
January 1, 2022 after the application
was filed.
 
5.    
The only amount outstanding is part of the Landlord's cost of filing
the application. As a
result, the order will be limited to costs only and not eviction.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $171.00
for the remaining cost of filing the application.
