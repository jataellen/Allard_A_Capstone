Hamed Saffarnajib and Sara
Asarzadeh (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tahereh
Bagheri and Parviz Khalaj Zamanabad (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video conference
on January 31, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord, Hamed Saffarnajib, and the
Landlords’ Legal Representative, Sassan Emam,
attended the hearing. As of 10:26 a.m. the Tenants were not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from June 15, 2021 to October 14, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords
served a Notice of Termination
effective October 11, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on
October 14, 2021. The Tenants
were in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.
3.    
The lawful monthly rent was $2,500.00.
4.    
The Landlords are not holding a last month's rent
deposit.
5.    
The Tenants have made no payments
since the application was filed.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of October
14, 2021, the date the Tenants gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlords.
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $10,000.00*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to October 14, 2021.

3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before February
22, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 23, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
