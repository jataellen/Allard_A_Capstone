Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26905-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


B (BASEMENT), 39 DUNDAS CRESCENT ST. CATHARINES ON L2T1T3


 




Between:


Norbert Krawiec Irinel Georgina Dini


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Rebecca Mitchell


Tenant



 
 
 
Norbert Krawiec and Irinel
Georgina Dini (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Rebecca Mitchell (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant
pay the rent the Tenant owes because
the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on January 17, 2022
with respect to application SOL-24798-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlords could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenant
failed to pay the lawful
monthly rent in full, on or before February
1, 2022. The Tenant failed to pay $40.00 towards
the arrears, on or before February 1, 2022
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order
required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlords are entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $6,486.00 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
SOL-24798-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $6,486.00
and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous
order SOL-24798-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the
order, the Tenant has failed
to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from February 1, 2022 to February 28, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,400.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 15, 2019 to February 18, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SOL-24798-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before March 1, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $5,882.21*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to February 18, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on
the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $46.03
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 19,
2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlords the full amount
owing* on or before March 1,
2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 2, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 1, 2022, then starting
March 2, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after March 2, 2022.
