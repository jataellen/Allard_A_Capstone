Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-99292-22
 
 



In the
  matter of:


1603 ATHANS AVENUE OTTAWA ON K1T1K9


 




Between:


Michel Maatouk
  Tony Maatouk


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Donna Roe Guy Lauzon


Tenants



 
 
 
Michel Maatouk and Tony Maatouk (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Donna
Roe and Guy Lauzon (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the
rent they owe because the Tenants
failed to meet a condition
specified in the order
issued by the Board on
February 1, 2022 with respect to application EAL-96549-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlords could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I
find that the Tenants have not met the following conditions specified in the order:
The Tenants did not pay $2337.00
arrears on or before February
1, 2022. The Tenants
did not pay $1950.00 rent on or before February 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the
Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlords are entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $18,696.00 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order EAL-96549-21. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $18,696.00 and that amount
is included in this order. As a result, the previous order EAL-96549-21 is
cancelled.




 
5.    
Since the date of the order,
the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from February 1, 2022 to February 28, 2022.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.    
Order EAL-96549-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 27, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $19,721.75*. This amount represents the rent
owing up to February 16, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for
the previous application.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $64.11
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 17, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before
February 27, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
February 28, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 27, 2022, then starting February
28, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after February 28, 2022.

The tenant has until February 26, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by February 26, 2022
the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on August 28, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
