Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-12580-19
 
T
C (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict D G
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (L1
Application).
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant
because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused undue
damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring
the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage; and because the Tenant,
another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the
residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant (L2 Application).

 
This
combined application was heard in Toronto on January 28, 2020.
 
Only the Landlord attended
the hearing. As of 10:04 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 Application – Non-Payment of Rent
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from July 1, 2019 to January 31, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective August 7, 2019.
2.      The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
3.      The monthly rent as of the date of the hearing is $
4.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,412.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 28, 2019 to
August 7, 2019.
6.      The
Tenant paid $2,824.00 after the application was filed.
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
L2
Application – Damage
8.      At
the hearing the Landlord that on November 3, 2019 the Tenant called the Landlord
and asked for a copy of the rental unit key. The Landlord could not give the Tenant
a copy of the key because in July 2019 the Tenant lost his key and the Landlord
gave the Tenant his only copy, which was not returned. 
9.      The
Landlord testified that soon after November 3, 2019 he noticed that the lock for
the rental unit had been removed. The Landlord checked the security video footage
and found that on November 3, 2019, two men came up to the rental unit door and
applied tools and force to the area of the door where the lock was located. The
Landlord submitted still photographs of this security footage showing the two men
and their activities with the door. The Landlord also submitted a photograph of
the door, showing that the lock had been removed. From the photograph, it appears
it was removed by force and that the door is damaged as a result.
10.   The
Landlord did not recognize either of the two men seen in the security camera footage.
The Landlord testified that to get to the rental unit, these men would have to have
been let into the building or have been given a key. 
11.   Based
on the Landlord’s uncontested evidence, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that
the Tenant caused the door to be damaged by directing two men to remove his lock
and by providing these men access to the rental unit. The evidence here is circumstantial
but a reasonable inference may be drawn that the Tenant, who had requested a key,
arranged for these men to remove his lock for him. 
12.   The
Landlord submitted an estimate for the repair of the door and the replacement of
the lock in the amount of $926.60 including HST. I find this to be a reasonable
cost for the repair.
L2 Application
– Interference with Others
13.   The
Landlord’s N5 notice of termination. also alleges that the Tenant substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another tenant. The N5 notice alleges that the Tenant removed
the lock and broke the door. The voiding period for the N5 notice is November 7,
2019 to November 13, 2019. 
14.   The
Landlord gave no evidence that the Tenant engaged in similar conduct during the
voiding period. I therefore find that the substantial interference portion of the
N5 notice is void.
L2 application:
s.83
15.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
16.   The
Tenant was not at the hearing to request relief from eviction. The Landlord seeks
termination. I believe it would be unfair to deny eviction in these circumstances.
When the Tenant was unable to enter the unit because he lost his unit key (for the
second time) and the Landlord could not let him in, he arranged for people to remove
his lock. This behaviour shows a blatant disregard for the Tenant’s obligations
to keep the unit and residential complex in a good state of repair. 
It is ordered that:
 
Regarding
the L1 application:
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the rent arrears portion of this order as set out below, the
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before February 17, 2020.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,344.96*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to February 6, 2020, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $46.42 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 7, 2020 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
February 17, 2020, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from February 18, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 17, 2020, then starting February
18, 2020, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 18,
2020.
8.      If,
on or before February 17, 2020, the Tenant pays the amount of $5,014.00** to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust, the rent arrears portion of this order
for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy would continue until February
17, 2020 when the tenancy is terminated for damage and interference with others. 
If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside the arrears portion of this order if they pay the amount required under
that subsection on or after February 18, 2020 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this
motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
Regarding
the L2 application:
10.   The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before February 17, 2020.
11.   If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 17, 2020, then starting February
18, 2020, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
12.   Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 18, 2020.
13.   The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $926.60 for the reasonable cost of repairing the
damage.
14.   If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before
February 17, 2020, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 18, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
