Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-35076-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


109 CLARK AVENUE THORNHILL ON L3T1T1


 




Between:


Wu Zumao


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Dayan Robinson Uenessa Satherland


Tenants



 
 
Wu Zumao (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dayan Robinson and Uenessa Satherland (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 24, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Alireza Hesami, attended the hearing. As of 10:19 a.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from January 1, 2018 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective October 4, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $2,368.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.    
The Tenants were credited
one month's rent in the amount of $2,368.00 on November 1, 2021 as compensation because the
Landlord served the Tenants with an N12 notice of termination.
 
6.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.

It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 11, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$18,736.56*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 31, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $77.85 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 1, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
11, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 12, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 11, 2022, then starting
February 12, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 12, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$18,819.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022,
or
ii)             
$21,187.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 11, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not make full
payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline,
then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 12, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
