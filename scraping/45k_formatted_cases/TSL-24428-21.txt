2526, 400 WALMER

and


 




 


Stephanie Jane Watson


Tenant



 
 
1420731 Ontario Inc C/o GWL Realty Advisors Residential Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Stephanie Jane Watson (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
12, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Faith McGregor, attended the hearing. As of 2:10 p.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
October 1, 2020 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective January
19, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $2,141.30
as of January 1, 2022.
 
4.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,166.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit has been paid to the Tenant
for the period
from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020.
 
6.    
The Tenant paid $8,861.60 after
the application was filed. The
Landlord's representative advised that the Tenant
made an on-line
payment in the amount of
$2,337.78 however
this amount has not cleared
yet. This has not been factored into the calculations of this order. This
payment will void this order if it clears.




 
7.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 30, 2022.
 
2.     As of the date of this order,
the amount of the rent deposit exceeds
the arrears of rent
and compensation the Landlord is entitled to by $818.06*.
 
3.     However, the Landlord
is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenant: $70.40 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting January 20, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit, and $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     The Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 30, 2022, then starting
January 31, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 31, 2022.
 
7.    
If, on or before January 30, 2022,
the Tenant pays the amount of $2,337.66** to the Landlord or to the Board in
trust, this order for eviction will be void.
This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after January
31, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
