Mohammad Dar
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Robert
James Mckendry and Denise Arlene Carvery (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the
rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on November 25, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s Legal Representative Kiran Treet, the Landlord and the Tenant Denise Carvery on her own behalf attended the
hearing. The Tenant Robert Mckendry
was not present or represented at the hearing although properly notified if
this hearing by the board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord
served an N4 notice of termination on the Tenants
that provided a termination date of August 29, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord
filed the L1 application with the Board on August
19, 2021.
 
3.    
As the date of application is before the Termination Date in the N4, the application cannot proceed. The Tenant had until August 29, 2021 to void the notice and the
Landlord filed this application before the expiry of the voiding period.
