In the
  matter of:


105, 767 SECOND
STREET LONDON ON N5V3C4


 




Between:


Capreit Limited Partnership


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Mikailey Giberson
  Zachary Edwards


Tenants



 
 
 
Capreit Limited Partnership (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Mikailey
Giberson and Zachary
Edwards (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 13, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative,
Ayden Pearson, attended the hearing. As of 2:11 p.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to September
30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 22, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent is $1.097.85.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $323.07 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from February
1, 2020 to January 22, 2022.
 
6.     The Tenants paid $4,400.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on
the




 
parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenants, and find
that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 28, 2022,
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $855.30*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
21, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$35.67 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 22, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
28, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)     
$1,664.91 if the payment is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)    
$2,749.84 if the payment is made
on or before February 28, 2022**.
If the
Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that
subsection on or after March 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once
during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
