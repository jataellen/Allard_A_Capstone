paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from February 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 31, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenants
vacated the rental
unit on September 30, 2021. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     
The lawful
monthly rent was $1,450.00.
 
4.     
The Tenants
have made no payments since the application was filed.

The Landlord
collected a rent deposit
of $1,450.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlord.

Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from October
1, 2020 to August 31, 2021.
