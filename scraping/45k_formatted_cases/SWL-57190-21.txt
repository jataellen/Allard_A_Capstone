File Number: SWL-57190-21
 



In the matter
of:


11, 285 THAMES
STREET N INGERSOLL ON
  N5C3M7


 




Between:


Amiraco Properties Inc.


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Joshua Filip Megan Holmes


Tenants



 
On November 12,
2021, Amiraco Properties Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Megan Holmes and Joshua Filip (the 'Tenants')
and for an order to have the Tenants
pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the
Board on September 2, 2021 with respect to application SWL-51765-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenants have not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenants failed to pay to the Landlord
on or before November 1, 2021 the lawful
rent.
 
3.    
The Tenants were
ordered to pay $186.00 for and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order SWL-51765-21. The amount that is still
owing from that order is
$186.00 and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous order SWL-
51765-21 is cancelled.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,362.53 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from May 12, 2019 to
January 6, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order SWL-51765-21 is cancelled.




File Number: SWL-57190-21
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 17, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$186.00. This amount
represents the costs
related to the application fee for the previous application.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
17, 2022, the Tenants will start
to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from
January 18, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January
18, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt of this
order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the unit
to the Landlord on or after January
18, 2022.
