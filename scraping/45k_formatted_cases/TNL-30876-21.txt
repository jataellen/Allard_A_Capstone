Order under Section 87(1)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-30876-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


UNIT 812, 10 MARTHA
EATON WAY WAY NORTH YORK ON M6M5B3


 




Between:


Manel Senanayake


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Penolia Gray


Tenant



 
 
 
Manel Senanayake (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Penolia Gray (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 8, 2021.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s representative, D. Rodrigo,
the Tenant, and the Tenant’s
representative, Kyle Warwick, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant was in possession of the rental
unit on the date the application was filed.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on April 17, 2021 with the consent of the Landlord.
 
3.    
The Landlord claimed that the
Tenant did not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the
period from October 1, 2020 to April 17, 2021.
 
4.     The Tenant paid $2,850.00 after
the application was filed.
 
5.     It is not disputed that the
Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,760.00 from the Tenant. The Landlord claimed that the rent deposit was applied to arrears with the consent
of the Tenant and that in a
previous application filed with the Board the Landlord indicated that there was
no deposit and the mediated agreement that resolved the application did not
include the deposit (TNL-5013-18). The Tenant testified that she did not agree
to have the deposit applied to arrears.
 
6.     The Landlord failed to prove that the Tenant authorized the use of the
rent deposit to pay rent arrears. The Landlord could not remember when the
deposit was applied. There was no
ledger with a running balance to support the Landlord’s claim. The mediated




File Number: TNL-30876-21
 
agreement does not mention
the deposit because
the focus of the agreement
is the payment of arrears,
not eviction.
 
7.     The Tenant also claimed that she did not receive a
Notice of Rent Increase (Form N1) from the Landlord for increasing the rent
from $40.69 to $1,890.52, effective October 1, 2020. The Landlord served the N1
on June 27, 2020, by leaving it at the Tenant’s door and on July 3, 2020 the Tenant confirmed
in a text message that she received
the N1 and a notice of termination for non-payment rent (Form N4) from
the Landlord. Thus, the rent increase is valid.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $147.02*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to April 17, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
 
2.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before February
11, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 12, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
