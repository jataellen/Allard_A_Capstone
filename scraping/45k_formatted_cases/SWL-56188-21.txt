Merry Lynne Reynolds (the

the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.

Only the Landlord's Legal
Representative, Teresa Hunt, attended the hearing. As of 2:32 p.m., the Tenant
was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served

rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from November 1, 2020 to November 30, 2021. Because

served a Notice of
Termination effective September 30, 2021.

21, 2021. The Tenant was in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.

The lawful monthly rent was $900.00.
4.     
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
5.     
The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The tenancy is terminated as of November
21, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $8,638.68*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to November 21, 2021.

The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
