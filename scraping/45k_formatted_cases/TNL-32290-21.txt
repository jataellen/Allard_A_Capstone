Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-32290-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


304, 2715
ISLINGTON AVENUE ETOBICOKE
  ON M9V5H3


 




Between:


Our Saviour Thistletown Lutheran Lodge


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Lan Kyu Yoon


Tenant



 
 
 
Our Saviour Thistletown Lutheran
Lodge (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Lan Kyu Yoon (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone
they permitted in the residential complex have substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or
another tenant.
 
This application was heard in
Passcode: 926 3155 0221# on August 19, 2021.
The Landlord’s representative John Krim and three witnesses attended
the hearing. The Board heard testimony
for the Landlord’s representative and witness Lina Scarpino, the Tenant’s
next-door neighbour.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     On a regular basis, as much as tow to three times a
week, the Tenant wakes up other tenants in the residential complex by yelling,
screaming, knocking and kicking on other tenant’s doors at all hours or the day and night.
This behaviour has been occurring for a long time.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s representative submits
that this is a senior’s
building and residents
now fear the Tenant and are afraid to leave their units due to the
Tenant’s behaviour.
 
3.     Based on the uncontested evidence
before me, I find the Tenant has substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of other tenants.
 
4.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of February
20, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 20, 2022.




File Number: TNL-32290-21
 
 
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 20, 2022, then starting February
21, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 21, 2022.

In accordance with section 81 of

Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
