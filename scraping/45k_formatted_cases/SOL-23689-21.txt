Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-23689-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


215A QUEEN STREET
W FERGUS ON N1M3R6


 




Between:


Corina Sipkes
  Luke Sipkes


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Faith-Anne Wiebe


Tenant



 
 
 
Corina Sipkes
and Luke Sipkes
(the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Faith-Anne Wiebe (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord
requires possession of the rental unit
for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on October 27, 2021.
The Landlords and the Tenant
attended the hearing. The Landlords were represented by Sarah Shannon.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     A preliminary issue was raised at the hearing based on
section 55.1 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). This section follows from section 48.1 of
the Act requiring a landlord
to compensate a tenant in an amount equal to one month’s
rent if the landlord, in good
faith, requires the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. Section
55.1 of the Act requires this compensation to take place no later than on
the termination date specified in the notice of termination of the tenancy
given by the landlord. The termination date in this case was September 30,
2021.
 
2.     Parties agreed that the
Tenant was not compensated before
September 30, 2021.
 
3.     Section 55.1 of the Act is plain that this
compensation must be paid no later than the termination date in the Form N12
Notice. In addition, subsection 83(4) of the Act clearly provides that no eviction
order shall be issued in a proceeding regarding a termination of a tenancy for the purpose of residential occupation until
the landlord has complied with section 48.1 of the Act.
 
4.     As a result
of the Landlords’ failure to comply with the strict requirements of section 55.1 of the Act, I must dismiss the
application.
 
It is ordered that:




File Number: SOL-23689-21
 
 
 
1.     The Landlords' application is dismissed.
