Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-99233-22
 



In the
  matter of:


3 HARRINGTON COURT OTTAWA ON K2K2S7


 




Between:


Song Qiu Haicheng
Qu


Landlords




 


and


 




 


Chris Clement


Tenant



 
On January 20, 2022, Song Qiu and
Haicheng Qu (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Chris Clement (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant entered
into an agreement to terminate
the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlords and the Tenant
signed an agreement
to terminate the tenancy as of
January 29, 2022.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 11, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 11, 2022, then starting February
12, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after February 12, 2022.

The tenant has until February 10, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under

files the motion
by February 10, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.
