  matter of:


1281 HURON STREET LONDON ON N5Y4L6


 




Between:

Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Winston Stephens


Tenant



 
 
 
Nathalie Ramirez and Parkplace
Properties (London) Ltd (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Winston Stephens (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the
rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the mediated settlement issued by
the Board on November 15, 2021 with respect to application SWL-53743-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The mediated settlement provided that the Landlords
could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the
Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the settlement.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following conditions specified in the settlement: The Tenant did not pay $1599.37 rent in
full on January 15, 2022. The Tenant did not pay $1599.37 rent in full on or
before February 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting mediated settlement required
the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of
the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlords are
entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The amount that is still owing, according to the terms
of the mediated settlement, for arrears of rent, and the costs related
to the application fee for the previous
application is
$16,420.51.
 
5.     Since the date of the mediated settlement, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that
became owing for the period from December 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,550.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from August 10, 2020 to February 24, 2022.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before March 7, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $15,910.73*. This amount
represents the rent owing up to
February 24, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the rent
deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $52.58
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 25, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before March 7,
2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 8, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 7, 2022, then starting March
8, 2022, the Landlords may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after March 8, 2022.
 
 
February 24, 2022

The tenant has until March 6, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under s. 78(9) of the Act. If
the tenant files the motion by March 6, 2022 the order will be stayed and the
Board will schedule a hearing.

Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental
unit is located.
