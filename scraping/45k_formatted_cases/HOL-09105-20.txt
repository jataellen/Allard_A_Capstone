In the
  matter of:


47 BUTCHER CRESCENT BRANTFORD ON N3T0P2


 




Between:


Eugeniu Chicerman


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Crystal Brady
Matthew Ramsay-edwards


Tenants



 
 
 
Eugeniu Chicerman (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Matthew Ramsay-edwards and Crystal Brady
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the
rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on June 22, 2021 and on December
13, 2021. The Landlord and
the Tenants attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from November 1, 2020 to December
31, 2020.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,850.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,850.00 on November 20, 2019. Interest
is due on the rent deposit.
 
5.     The Landlord attempted to apply the rent deposit to
arrears of rent, however it can only be applied to the last month’s rent when the Tenants vacate
or the tenancy is terminated.
 
6.     The parties agreed
that the arrears
for the period ending December
31, 2021 is
$16,425.00 +1850.00
(rent deposit improperly applied) = $18,275.00.

7.    
The Tenants had indicated that
they intended to raise issues under section 82 of the RTA. However,
the Tenants failed
to provide advance
notice per s.82(2).
I indicated that eviction was not going to be ordered,
and that they could submit a tenant application to raise any issues. Therefore, no Tenant issues were
considered at the hearing.
 
8.    
During the June 22, 2021 hearing
the Landlord confirmed that the application would be converted to an L9 application for arrears only. This was set out in order HOL-09105-20-
IN issued on June 25, 2021.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlord $18,275.00, which represents the amount of rent
owing up to December 31, 2020.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before February
15, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 16,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
