Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19775-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


TH4, 220 BRENYON
WAY TORONTO ON M1B3G2


 




Between:


Brenyon Way Charitable Foundation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Bridgette Malcolm


Tenant



 
 
 
Brenyon Way Charitable Foundation (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Malcolm
Bridgette (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has been persistently late in
paying the Tenant's rent. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit
after the termination date.
 
The Tenant’s
name is Bridgette Malcolm, and the party names were amended accordingly. This application was heard by
video conference on January 11, 2022.
Only the Landlord’s legal
representative, D. Ciobotaru, attended the hearing.
Before a break for
lunch, I said, on the record, that I would
deal with this matter
first after the break that
was due to conclude at 1:45 p.m. The Tenant was not in attendance, so I said
that I would wait until 2 p.m. The
Tenant was not present at 2 p.m., so I heard the matter on an uncontested
basis. The Tenant did not attend
until 2:30 p.m., after the matter had already been heard.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has persistently failed
to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
2.     The Landlord’s ledger
indicates that the Tenant has paid the rent late, or failed to pay the
rent, almost every month since 2019.
 
3.     The Landlord’s legal
representative said that there is still a balance of over $350.00
owed to the Landlord from the rent for January, 2022. The Landlord requests an order for the
Tenant to pay the rent on time.
 
4.     I find that since Tenant
has been paying
rent persistently late for such a
prolonged period, the Landlord is entitled to an order for the Tenant to
pay the rent on time.

5.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances above, in accordance with subsection 83(2)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act'), and find that it
would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the
conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of
the Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall
pay the rent, in full, no later than the first day of each month,
commencing February, 2022, up to, and including January, 2023.
 
2.     Section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 applies
to paragraph 1 of this order. If the Tenant fails to make any payment, the
Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to the Board for an order
terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord must make this application no later than 30
days after the Tenant fails to make a
payment.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before January
30, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 31, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
