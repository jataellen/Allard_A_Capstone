AM
and JD (the 'Tenants') applied for an order determining that EI (the
'Landlord') failed to meet the Landlord's maintenance obligations under the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') or failed to comply with health, safety,
housing or maintenance standards.
 
The
Landlord applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants
because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
These
applications were heard together in Toronto on July 20, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, TY, and the Tenants attended the
hearing.  
 
Determinations:
 
Preliminary Issue:  the Parties to the Applications
 
1.      The
Tenants’ application was amended to name only the corporate Landlord as the
respondent to their application.
The
Landlord’s Application for Non-payment of Rent
2.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from May 1, 2018 to July 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination effective May 30, 2018.
 
3.      At
the hearing, the Tenants testified that they withheld rent from the Landlord
because of maintenance and repair defects at the rental unit.  The Tenants
further testified that they are able to pay their rental arrears to Landlord
immediately.
 
4.      The
Tenants paid $1,000.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,300.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from April 1, 2018
to May 30, 2018.
 
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.  Because the Tenants
saved the money they were required to pay to the Landlord for rent, they agreed
to pay the amount they owe to the Landlord within 11 days from the date of this
order.
The
Tenants’ Application
8.      The
Tenants proved that the Landlord has failed to maintain the rental unit, or has
failed to comply with health, safety, housing or maintenance standards.
 
9.      The
Tenants proved that there is a rodent infestation in the rental unit and
residential complex.  The Tenants adduced photographic evidence of mice in the
rental unit.  The Tenant  AL gave evidence that the Tenants observed a mouse in
the rental unit as recently as two days before the hearing date.  The Tenants
testified that they advised the Landlord of the presence of mice in the rental
unit at the beginning of April 2018.
 
10.   The
Landlord’s superintendent gave the Tenants glue mouse traps after receiving the
Tenants’ complaint.  The Landlord also had a pest control technician attend at
the property on May 14, 2018 and again on July 8, 2018.  The Landlord also
filled various cracks and holes throughout the rental unit on May 8, 2018 in an
effort to prevent mice from entering into the rental unit.  
 
11.   The
Tenants, however, testified that the Landlord’s efforts have not resolved the
problem. The Tenants adduced evidence that other residents at the residential
complex also complain of mice.  Based on this evidence, I find that the
residential complex, and not just the Tenants’ rental unit, is experiencing a
problem with mice. 
 
12.   The
Landlord’s representative did not have knowledge of the presence of mice at the
rental unit or residential complex, or of the Landlord’s efforts to address the
issue.  The Landlord’s representative therefore did not adduce evidence to
dispute, or otherwise challenge, the Tenant’s evidence of mice at the rental
property.
 
13.   I
therefore find that the Tenants proved that the Landlord has not met its duty
to maintain the rental unit and residential complex free of mice.
 
14.   At
the hearing, the Tenants requested an order requiring the Landlord to
compensate them for personal property that was damaged by mice.  The Tenants
adduced evidence that mice damaged a new baby stroller.  The cost to replace
the baby stroller is $249.97, plus HST.  The Tenants also testified that mice
damaged approximately $50.00 worth of dried foods, and $30.00 in new clothing
for the Tenants’ infant child.  The Tenants testified that they disposed of
their toaster, because it had become contaminated with mouse droppings.  The
Tenants estimated that their costs to replace the toaster will be $30.00.
 
15.   The
Landlord’s representative conceded that he did not have evidence to dispute, or
otherwise challenge, the Tenants’ evidence of their costs to replace damaged
items.  I therefore accept the Tenants’ evidence of their replacement costs,
and find that their estimates are reasonable.  The Landlord shall therefore be
ordered to compensate the Tenants in the amount of $392.46 for property that
was damaged by mice.  The Tenants’ rental arrears shall be reduced by this
amount, and by the Tenants’ $45.00 Board filing costs.
 
16.   There
shall also be an order requiring the Landlord to resolve the mouse infestation
at the rental unit and residential complex.
 
17.   The
Tenants proved that the bathroom ceiling leaked approximately 18 times from
August 3, 2018 to July 10, 2018.  The Landlord, however, responded to the
Tenants’ complaints by attending at the rental unit to help clean the bathroom,
and by hiring a contractor to replace damaged drywall and the bathroom ceiling
in May 8, 2018.  
 
18.   The
Tenants testified that the last bathroom ceiling leak occurred on July 10,
2018.  The Landlord responded to the Tenants’ complaint by speaking with the
Tenants’ upstairs neighbour.  The Tenants testified that they do not know what
the Landlord discussed with the upstairs neighbour, but agreed that there has
not been a bathroom ceiling leak since July 10.
 
19.   The
Tenants testified that they were advised in April 2018 that the likely cause of
the bathroom ceiling leak is the upstairs neighbour’s children, who splash
water when they take a bath.  The upstairs unit’s bathroom is located directly
above the Tenants’ bathroom.  The Tenants also testified that the Landlord’s
plumber inspected the rental unit on May 8, 2018.  The Landlord’s plumber did
not find any defect or other issue with the unit’s plumbing system.  
 
20.   Based
on the Tenants’ own evidence, I find that it is more likely than not that the
bathroom ceiling leaks were caused by the Tenants’ upstairs neighbour. 
Although I do not doubt that the Tenants were inconvenienced by the number of
leaks, their evidence shows that the Landlord responded to their complaints. 
The Landlord repaired minor water damage to the bathroom, and also resolved the
problem by speaking with the Tenants’ upstairs neighbour.
 
21.   I
therefore find that the Tenants did not prove that the Landlord failed to meet
its obligations with respect to the bathroom ceiling leak.
 
22.   The
Tenants also did not prove that the Landlord failed to address water leaks and
flooding in the Tenants’ bedroom.
 
23.   At
the hearing, the Tenants testified that they returned to the rental unit on
April 6, 2018 to find that their bedroom had been flooded with water.  The
Tenants submitted an April 6, 2018 photograph showing water on their bedroom
floor.  The Tenants told the Landlord of the problem, and the Landlord arrived
at the rental unit within 10 minutes to help clean the bedroom.
 
24.   The
bedroom leak recurred approximately 10 times between April 6, 2018 and June
2018.  There was, however, no reliable evidence adduced at the hearing of when
and how often the Tenants advised the Landlord of water leaks or of flooding
after April 6, 2018.  Nevertheless, the Landlord did have a contractor attend
at the unit on July 6, 2018.  The contractor was not able to identify the cause
of the routine bedroom flooding.  The Tenants also did not know the cause of
the bedroom flooding.
 
25.   The
Tenants agreed that the last incident of leaks or flooding in their bedroom was
in June 2018.
 
26.   Under
the circumstances, and based on the evidence adduced at the hearing, I find
that the Landlord acted promptly upon receiving the Tenants’ complaint of the
April 6, 2018 bedroom flood.  I also find neither the Tenants nor the Landlord
knows what caused the flooding between April 6, 2018 and June 2018, when the
problem stopped.  The Tenants, therefore, did not prove that the Landlord
failed to meet its maintenance obligations with respect to bedroom flooding.
It is ordered that:
 
The Landlord’s Application
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and
the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before August 11, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $1,190.76*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to July 31, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit and less the amount of the Tenants’
Board filing costs and compensation for the Tenants’ damaged personal property.
 
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $42.74 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting August 1, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before August
11, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from August 12, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before August 11, 2018, then starting August 12,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after August 12,
2018.
 
8.      If
the Tenants wish to void this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $2,652.54 if the payment is made on or before July 31, 2018, or
ii)       $3,952.54 if the payment is made on or before August 11, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after August 12, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
The
Tenants’ Application
10.   The
Landlord shall undertake to keep the rental unit and residential complex free
of mice.
