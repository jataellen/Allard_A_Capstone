Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-34476-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


92 AVIEMORE DRIVE
(Main Level) NORTH YORK ON
  M9L2L7


 




Between:


Krishna Rambaran Natasha Rambaran Khemwattie Rambaran


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Joseph Solomon


Tenant



 
 
 
Krishna Rambaran, Natasha
Rambaran and Khemwattie Rambaran (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Joseph Solomon (the 'Tenant') because
the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The
Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the
unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on January
20, 2022. The Landlord
Natasha Rambaran, and the Tenant, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     It is the Tenant’s position that the Landlord has
served the notice in bad faith. This
is based on the submission that the Landlord
had suggested a higher rent in the past and an issue with utility bills.
 
2.    
The Landlord is living
with her parents,
is in her early 30’s, works as a nurse
in the health field, and wants to move out from her parents’ home. The Landlord testified that in addition,
her parents are elderly and due to her work environment, she does not want to
take the chance of passing Covid onto them.
 
3.     The Landlord points
to the fact she has already served
an earlier N12 for
her own use on February 22,
2021, but that application was dismissed because she did not pay the required
compensation to the Tenant before the termination date on the notice. The Landlord also testified that she had
verbally informed the Tenant in November 2020 that she wanted to move into the unit and the Tenant
had told her he would
be vacating in the
Spring of 2021.
 
4.     The Tenant denied
this conversation took place.




 
 
 
5.     I find the Tenant has not established that the Landlord
has served the notice in bad faith.
 
6.     I find the Landlords in good faith requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
7.     The Tenant is seeking a delay in the termination the tenancy until
September 2022.
 
8.     Considering the fact the Landlord began this process
nearly one year ago and has been waiting to gain access to the unit since that
time, and the fact the Tenant has made no effort to locate alternative accommodations while knowing
the Landlord has applied twice to gain access to the unit, I find it would be unfair to the Landlord
to delay the termination until
September 2022.
 
9.    
The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,500.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
10.  Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from August 2, 2016 to
October 31, 2021
 
11.  The Landlord paid the Tenant compensation equal to one month's rent on October
15, 021.
 
12.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until April 30, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated, as of April 30, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the
rental unit on or before April 30, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords
$2,580.74, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from November 1, 2021
to January 24, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on
the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $49.32
per day for compensation for the use of the unit from January 25, 2022 to
the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlords the full amount
owing on or before February
4, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 5, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated on or before April 30, 2022, then starting May 1, 2022, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.




 
6.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after May 1, 2022.
