Tenant




 


 
and


 




 


Shaliga Varatharasan


Landlord



 
 
T6 Application
Louis Turcotte (the 'Tenant')
applied for an order determining that Shaliga Varatharasan (the 'Landlord') failed to meet the Landlord's maintenance obligations under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') or failed to comply with
health, safety, housing or maintenance standards.
 
T2 Application
Louis Turcotte (the 'Tenant')
applied for an order determining that Shaliga Varatharasan (the 'Landlord') substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
of the rental unit or residential
complex by the Tenant or by a member of the Tenant's household.
 
 
This application was heard via videoconference on November 23, 2021.
 
The Tenant and the Landlord attended
the hearing. The Tenant spoke with Duty Counsel prior to
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant filed a T2 application about Tenant Rights on January
10, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant filed a T6 application about maintenance alleging
that there were maintenance issues in the rental
unit. Specifically:
 
a.   
The oven gasket seal was broken.
b.   
The range hood fan was not functioning.
c.   
There were no window
coverings installed.
d.   
There was a plumbing
issue affecting the appliances.
e.   
The central lights were flickering incessantly.
f.    
The washroom door would not latch closed.




 
3.    
It was uncontested that the
Tenant took possession on October 15, 2020. The
issues were almost immediately noted and reported
to the Landlord. It was also uncontested that the repairs were complete
as follows:
 
a.   
Oven gasket resolved November
11, 2020.
b.   
Range Hood remains ongoing,
not for function but for cosmetic appearances.
c.   
Window coverings resolved November
13, 2020.
d.   
The plumbing issue was resolved on November 4, 2020.
e.   
The flickering lights were resolved on November 7, 2020.
f.    
The washroom door was resolved on November 2, 2020.
 
4.     Therefore, the evidence
shows that from date of possession, to final resolution of issues was a mere
matter of weeks.
 
5.    
The exception remains the range hood. The Tenant testified that the Range hood was replaced, by
removing the cabinetry and installing a new hood at ceiling height. The exposed wall where the former cabinet
was, has not been painted to date of hearing. Further, in order to install the new range hood, the installer had to cut into the adjoining
cabinets to make it fit. The Tenant
testified that he had to stretch to turn use the hood controls.
 
6.    
The Landlord testified that the electrician had installed the range hood higher than usual,
that it would still be effective.
 
7.     There was no evidence that the height
was not in conformity with the building
code.
 
8.     The Tenant testified that it was the impact of these
repair issues, that he had lost time from work, to address defects, to attend
to several visits from plumbers, electricians and the superintendent to supervise
the work. Further
that until the repairs he had limited
use of the stove and kitchen in general. The Tenant further testified that he was not able to host guests
due to these issues.
 
9.    
The Tenant explained that he works from home and spends
2-3 hours a day online
with clients, that there is no physical presence in the home.
 
10.  The Landlord testified to the efforts to effect the
repairs, and that where parts were required that this did result in short delays and multiple visits.
However, the Landlord
did testify that she could supervise the repairs if needed.
 
11.  The Act and the case law in this area indicates that
if the Landlord responded to the disrepair in a timely and effective manner
then no monetary remedy will normally flow. (See the Board’s Interpretation
Guideline 5 Breach of Maintenance Obligations and Onyskiw v. CJM Property
Management Ltd., 2016 ONCA 477.) Some disrepair is within the reasonable expectation of the parties. Things
break down, disrepair happens. So long as the Landlord attends to it
promptly, the Tenants are not entitled to a remedy for it.




 
12.  Based on the uncontested testimony
regarding the timing of the repairs, and even noting for COVID, excluding the range
hood, I am not satisfied that the tenant has not demonstrated that the Landlord
has failed to meet their obligations under the Act. The repairs were effected in a timely manner.
 
13.  However, regarding the range hood, I am satisfied that
the Landlord has failed to complete the cosmetic repairs, by failing to paint
the previously covered parts of the wall that
are now exposed
by the new range hood. Therefore, I find that the Landlord
failed to meet the Landlord's obligations under subsection
20(1) of the Act to repair the rental unit.
 
14.  Turning now to the T2 application, Ontario Regulation
516/06 at paragraph 8 (3) states that the Board shall not determine that an
interference was substantial unless the carrying out the work constituted an
interference that was unreasonable in the circumstances. I am not satisfied that the extent of the repairs was
unreasonable or that is amounted
to substantial interference. The Tenant admitted
that he did not host people
for work reasons, and thus the impact is minimal at best. It should be expected that multiple visits
by repairman may be required to effect repairs, particularly when parts or
replacements need be ordered, that are not otherwise readily on hand.
 
15.  The Tenant withdrew
his claims for a fine and to have the tenancy terminated. He further agreed
that any rent abatement would cover both applications.
 
16.  The Tenant requested
an order for the Landlord
to complete all repairs. For the range hood, it is reasonable to order the
cosmetic repairs to be completed.
 
17.  The Tenant seeks an abatement of rent equal
to one-month’s rent ($2,025.00).
 
18.  With respect to abatement of the rent, abatement is
designed to address the idea that a tenant is paying
for a bundle of goods and services
and if the tenant is not receiving
them then the rent should be abated proportional to the difference
between what is being paid for and what is being received.
 
19.  With respect to quantum of abatement, the Board generally
takes into account
the impact of the disrepair on
the Tenants. In this regard, it is
the ongoing cosmetic issues that remain unresolved. I find it difficult to determine that this has impacted hosting
of guests or working online from home. As
I have already found that the Landlord did act reasonably in all the
circumstances to effect repairs in a timeline manner, for the one remaining
cosmetic issue a minimal abatement in this regard is warranted.
 
20.  Considering that the cosmetic issue does not affect the use of the kitchen,
the range or the range hood, an abatement of $25.00
per month that this remains ongoing shall be ordered. ($25.00 X 15 months (October 2020 to January 2022))
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.     The Landlord shall pay to the Tenant
a rent abatement of $375.00.




 
2.    
The Landlord shall complete
the cosmetic repair
work surrounding the range hood, not
later than February 28, 2022.
 
3.     If the Landlord does
not do the work by February
28, 2022, the Tenant is authorized
to arrange for the work to be done and may recover the cost of the work by deducting
the amount from the rent paid in the first month work is done until
there is no longer any money owing.
 
4.    
If the Tenant denies access to the Landlord
or repairman for any reason,
then the Tenant may not undertake the work and may
not claim reimbursement by deducting from the rent.
 
5.    
The Landlord shall also pay the Tenant $48.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
6.      
The total amount the Landlord owes the Tenant
is $423.00
 
7.     The Landlord shall pay the Tenant the full amount owing by January 23, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Landlord does not pay the
Tenant the full amount owing by January 23, 2022 the Landlord will owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from January
24, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the outstanding
balance.
 
9.     If the Landlord
does not pay the Tenant
the full amount owing by January 31, 2022, then the Tenant may deduct this amount
from the monthly rent for February 2022.
