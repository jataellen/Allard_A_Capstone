Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-20789-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


306, 95 TWENTY-FIFTH STREET TORONTO ON M8V3P9


 




Between:


Melrose Park

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kerry Chalmers
  Kris Kolacz


Tenants



 
 
 
Melrose Park Investments Limited
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Kris
Kolacz and Kerry Chalmers (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the
rent that the Tenants owe. The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges and
related administration charges.
 
This application was heard via
videoconference on July 21, 2021 at
9:00 a.m.
 
Only the Landlord, represented by Robert Heugham,
a licensed Paralegal, attended the hearing. The Tenants were not present or
represented at the hearing though being properly served with the Notice of
Hearing by the Board.
The hearing proceeded without
the Tenants at 12:11 p.m.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the
total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from December 1, 2020 to July 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective February 26, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants were in possession of the rental
unit when the application
was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $926.43
 
4.     The Landlord incurred
charges of $20.00 for
a cheque tendered by or on behalf
of the Tenants, which was
returned NSF and $5.00 for related administration charges.
 
5.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $926.43 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.




 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
1, 2021 to February 26, 2021.
 
7.     As of the hearing date, the Tenant owed the Landlord,
$7,319.36 including arrears of rent to July 31, 2021 of $$7,319.36, N.S.F.
cheque and administration fee of $25.00 and the application fee of $186.00.
Since the hearing, another seven rental periods have begun, and three more
month’s rent have become due. Therefore, the amount in this order includes
August 2021, September 2021, October 2021, November 2021, December 2021, January 2022 and February 2022’s
rent. If the Tenant has paid the Landlord August 2021,
September 2021, October
2021, November 2021,
December 2021, January 2022 and February 2022’s rent, and
/or made any payments to the Landlord since the hearing, the Landlord shall
deduct those payments from the amount owing in this order.
 
8.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenants did not attend the hearing
to present evidence or submissions in support of granting relief from eviction
and no circumstances were disclosed at the hearing or appeared in the Board
file.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental
unit on or before February
20, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $12,276.20*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February 9,
2022 and the total charges related to a NSF cheque tendered to the Landlord
by or on behalf of the Tenants,
less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $30.46
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 10,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
20, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 21, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 20, 2022, then starting
February 21, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 21, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 20, 2022, the Tenants pay
the amount of $14,040.37** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction
will be void. This means that the




 
tenancy would not be terminated
and the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that
the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 21, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
