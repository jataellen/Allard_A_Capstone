Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: SOL-24806-21
 



In the matter
of:


1, 104 HESS STREET S HAMILTON ON L8P3N5


 




Between:


Ryan Mazzuca Lauren
Mazzuca


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Kevin Varty Matthew Varty


Tenants



 
 
Ryan Mazzuca and
Lauren Mazzuca (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kevin Varty and Matthew Varty (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on January 11, 2022. One of the Landlords, Ryan Mazzuca and one of the
Tenants, Kevin Varty, attended the hearing. The Tenant met with Tenant Duty Counsel
and obtained summary
legal information prior
to the commencement of the hearing.
 
The Tenant indicated he had section 82 issues he wanted to raise but
understood he did not comply with the disclosure requirements and the issues
would not be heard at this hearing.
The Tenant reserves the right to raise these issues and will further
investigate filing his own application.
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the
period from September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of
Termination effective September 17, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,600.00.
 
4.    
The Landlords are not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.    
The Tenants
have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
6.    
It is uncontested the total rent arrears owing to the Landlord by the Tenants
to January 31, 2022 is
$8000.00.




File Number: SOL-24806-21
 
7.    
The Tenant requested
the Board grant relief and impose a repayment plan that would preserve the tenancy and allow the Tenants to gradually pay to the Landlord the arrears
owing. Specifically, he proposed $150.00 to be paid monthly in addition to the
rent.
 
8.    
The Landlord was
opposed to the repayment plan requested by the Tenant due to the length of the
plan which would be approximately 4.5 years and because he believes the Tenants
have not shown any good faith; they used to have their rent payments paid
directly through ODSP however the Tenants requested that process to be
discontinued and despite receiving
benefit payments, the last payment
received was August
2021. He requested an
expedited order.
 
9.    
The Tenant testified due to a recent medical
condition he is unable to remember where he spent his money since September
2021.
 
10.  I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
including the Tenants’
person, financial and health
issues and weighed this against any potential prejudice to the Landlord and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 16,
2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. This will afford the Tenants
additional time to secure financial assistance with the rent arrears or locate
alternative housing.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 16, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlords $7,311.45*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 17, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlords $52.60 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 18, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before February
16, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 17, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 16, 2022, then starting February
17, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 17, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlords or to the Board in trust:




File Number: SOL-24806-21
 
i)               
$8,186.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022,
or
ii)             
$9,786.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 16, 2022**.
If the Tenants
do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlords
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the
Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 17, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during
the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
