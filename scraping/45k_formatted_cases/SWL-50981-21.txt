Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Ken Johnston


Tenant



 
 
 
Woojung Yeo (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ken Johnston (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 3, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Gina Kim, attended
the hearing. As of 10:39 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period
from August 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021. Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective April 8,
2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on June 28, 2021. The Tenant
was in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $890.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of June
28, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$7,010.06*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to June 28, 2021.




File Number: SWL-50981-21
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 22, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 23, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
