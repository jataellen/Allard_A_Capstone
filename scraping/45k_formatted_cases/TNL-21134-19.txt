Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-21134-19
 
 
 
 
CZ (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict ACH and RARG (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe and because the Tenants have been
persistently late in paying the rent.
 
This application was heard in Newmarket on January 15,
2020.
 
Only the Landlord's
Representative, RY attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from July 15,
2019 to February 14, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a
Notice of Termination.
 
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,710.24 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
 
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from December 16, 2018 to January 24,
2020.
 
4.     
The Landlord seeks, in
addition to an order non-payment of rent, an order for termination based on the
Tenants having been persistently late in paying the rent.  I reviewed the schedule
of payments included with the Landlord’s N8 notice of termination and note
that, until the Tenants fell fully into arrears in July 2019, they were
consistently late in their rent by a few days each month.  In the circumstances
I consider that, if the Tenants void the portion of this order pertaining to
arrears of rent, that they be allowed the opportunity to continue the tenancy
as long as they pay rent in full and on time for 12 months going forward.
 
5.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act with respect to
the application for eviction on the basis of arrears and find that it would not
be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in
this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act with respect
to the application for eviction for persistent late payment.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before February
4, 2020.
 
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $8,516.97*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to January 24, 2020, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $46.86 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting January 25, 2020 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 4, 2020, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
February 5, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 4, 2020, then starting February 5, 2020, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 5, 2020.
 
8.     
If, on or before February 4,
2020, the Tenants pay the amount of $11,876.64** to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after February 5, 2020
but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
 
 
10.  
If the Tenants void the
eviction provisions under this order pursuant to paragraph 8 or 9, then the
Tenants shall pay the monthly rent on or before the first day of each month for
twelve months from February 1, 2020 through January 1, 2021.
 
11.  
If the Tenants fail to make any
of the payments set out in paragraph 10 in full and on time, the Landlord may
apply to the Board, under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
within 30 days of the breach, without notice to the Tenants, for an order
terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants.
