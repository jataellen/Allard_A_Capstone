Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55674-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1247 VICTORIA DRIVE LONDON ON N5Y4E3


 




Between:


Molly Gardiner
  Jacob Palmer


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Luther Webster-brown
  Wing Belanger


Tenants



 
 
 
Molly Gardiner and Jacob Palmer (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Luther Webster-brown and Wing Belanger (the 'Tenants') because they have been persistently
late in paying their rent.
 
This application was heard via video conference on January 24, 2022.
The Landlords and the Tenant, Wing Belanger attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlords’ L2 application is based on a N8 notice of termination served
on the Tenants on October 10,
2021 with a termination date of December 14, 2021.
 
2.    
This is a month to month
tenancy which commenced in September, 2018 with rent
of
$1,900.00 due on the 15th of every month.
 
3.     The Landlords allege
that the Tenants
have been persistently late in paying
their rent on time.
The Landlord, Jacob Palmer (‘J.P.’) testified that the Tenants were late
in paying their rent in February, March,
April, August, October,
November and December
of 2020. The Tenants have also been late in paying rent in January, April, May, July, August and September
of 2021 and are in rent arrears. The
Landlords have had communications with the Tenants regarding the rent being
persistently late but it continues.
 
4.     As such, the Landlords seek a termination of the tenancy.
 
5.     The Tenants do not dispute
the allegation that rent has been persistently late.




 
6.    
The Tenant Wing Belanger (‘W.B.’)
testified that as a result of the COVID pandemic her partner has been laid off
work for two years. He is employed as
a labourer and just recently secured employment however during the entire pandemic, she has been the sole breadwinner of the household. W.B. stated that they have three adult children
ages 23, 22 and 19 with two being in school.
 
7.     W.B. acknowledged that she and her partner can no
longer afford the rental unit and seeks to come to an arrangement to end the tenancy but requires some time to obtain alternative arrangements as she
has no family to turn to.
 
8.     The Landlords agree to accommodate the Tenants by giving them an
additional 60 days to vacate the rental unit however the Tenants are requesting to vacate the rental unit by June 1, 2022.  The
Landlords state that not only are the Tenants persistently late in paying rent
but they are in arrears and owe the Landlords $3,300.00. The Landlords state that they been impacted by the Tenants being persistently late with rent
payments as they have had to borrow from an existing loan to pay the mortgage
and the property taxes.
 
9.    
Based on the evidence before the
Board and that the Tenants do not dispute the Landlords allegations, I am satisfied that the Tenants
have been persistently late in paying their
rent.
 
10.  While the Tenants’ income will most likely increase
due to W.B.’s partner becoming recently employed, there
was no evidence before the Board that even with that additional income, the Tenants’ financial
situation would improve
in the foreseeable future. Further, the Landlords have been impacted
financially due to the Tenants being unable to pay their rent on time. Thus, I find a delay in eviction to April
30, 2022 would be reasonable to allow the Tenants to secure alternative
accommodations.
 
11.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the ‘Act’), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until April 30, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
12.  This order contains
all of the reasons in this matter and no further reasons
will be issued.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before April 30, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated on or before April 30, 2022, then
starting May 1, 2022, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.




 
 
 
3.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after May 1, 2022.
 
 
 
February 17, 2022
Date Issued
 
South West-RO
150 Dufferin Avenue, Suite 400, 4th Floor
London ON N6A5N6
