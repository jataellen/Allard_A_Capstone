Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-03639-18
 










 
 
 

LC
and JYC (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict AK and JS (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on November 1, 2018.
 
The Landlord, L. C attended the hearing.
 
 Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required
to pay for the period from June 1, 2018 to November 30, 2018.  Because of the
arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective September 6,
2018.
2.     
The Landlords collected a rent deposit of $1,100.00 from the
Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlords.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the
period from May 15, 2018 to September 6, 2018.
4.     
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance
with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Landlord, upon receipt of this order, must give a copy of this
order to the Tenants by a method set out in subsection 191 (1) of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, other than sending it by mail or courier to
the last known address where the Tenants reside or carries on business. 
2.     
Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the
rental unit on or before November 12, 2018.
3.     
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $9,167.54*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to November 5, 2018,
less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $72.33 per day for
compensation for the use of the unit starting November 6, 2018 to the date the
Tenants move out of the unit.
5.     
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $175.00 for the cost
of filing the application.
6.     
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on
or before November 12, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will
be simple interest calculated from November 13, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
7.     
If the unit is not vacated on or before November 12, 2018, then
starting November 13, 2018, the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after
November 13, 2018.
9.     
If, on or before November 12, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of
$12,275.00** to the Landlords or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction
will be void.  This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the
Tenants could remain in the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on
time, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
10.  
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that
subsection on or after November 13, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant
possession to the Landlords. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
