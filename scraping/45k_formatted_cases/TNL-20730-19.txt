Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-20730-19
 











 
 
 

DX (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict SM and JM (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay
the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Newmarket on January 13,
2020.
 
The Landlord’s legal
representative, ZR, and the former Tenant, JM, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from March 1, 2019 to
January 31, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination.
 
2.     
The Landlord’s witness,
(JC), is a friend who helps the Landlord take care of the property.  JC said
that the Tenants used the last month’s rent deposit a long time ago, so the
Landlord is not holding a last month’s rent deposit.
 
3.     
The Tenants were father and
son. The former Tenant, (JM), said that he told the Landlord in February, 2019,
that he would move out of the rental unit.  He testified that he has not lived
in the rental unit since May, 2019.  He said that he has not spoken with his
son since November, 2019.
 
4.     
JM submitted into evidence a
non-standard lease between him and a party named NTK, that commenced on May 1,
2019, for a unit that cost $850.00 per month.
 
5.     
JM said that he gave verbal
notice of his departure to the Landlord.
 
6.     
JM said that he does not
believe he is responsible for any rent money owed since May 1, 2019.  He said
that he was told that his son would continue to pay the rent.
 
7.     
JC said that the Landlord
was aware that the Tenant intended to move out, but he said that the Landlord
was never given written notice, nor was the Landlord given a date when the
Tenant moved out.
 
8.     
JC also said that the Tenant
never returned the key. JC said that JM was asked for the key, and he repeatedly
said that he would return the key, but he has not returned it to date.
 
9.     
The Landlord is seeking a
standard termination order against both Tenants.  The Landlord submits that JM
never gave written notice of when he was moving out, nor has he returned the
key. The Landlord submits that the arrears owed are significant, and that it is
severely prejudicial to the Landlord for the tenancy to continue.
 
10.  
JM submits that he consents
to a termination order, since he no longer lives in the rental unit.  However,
he submits that he is not responsible for any rent money owed after May 1,
2019.  He said that he has a limited income of $40,000.00, and that he owes the
Landlord only two months of rent.
 
11.  
I find that it is undisputed
that the two named Tenants were jointly responsible for the monthly rent until
JM departed, and that they were both Tenants of the Landlord.
 
12.  
I find that it is undisputed
that JM never gave written notice that he was moving out, nor did he ever
inform the Landlord of the specific date he moved out.  In addition, JM never
returned the keys to the Landlord.  
 
13.  
However, it is undisputed
that JM moved out of the rental unit.  JC said that the Landlord was aware that
the Tenant no longer lived in the rental unit.  In fact, that was the reason
that the Landlord kept asking JM for the keys to the rental unit.
 
14.  
JM’s evidence proves, on a
balance of probabilities, that he was no longer in possession of the rental
unit as of May 1, 2019.
 
15.  
Pursuant to subsection
87(1)(b) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’), a landlord
may apply to the Board for an order for the payment of arrears of rent if the
tenant is in possession of the rental unit.
 
16.  
It is largely undisputed
that JM was not in possession of the rental unit on October 12, 2019, when the
Landlord applied to the Board.  Only SM was in possession of the rental unit on
that date.  I find, on a balance of probabilities, that JM was no longer in
possession of the rental unit as of April 30, 2019.
 
17.  
Consequently, the Landlord
shall have a standard termination order in the name of SM. as the only Tenant
in possession of the rental unit on the date the Landlord filed their
application. 
 
18.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.  The arrears are
substantial.  S. Magill has not paid any rent for over 10 months.  It is
severely prejudicial to the Landlord to have the tenancy continue.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before March 15,
2020.
 
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $21,752.94*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to March 4, 2020.
 
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $59.18 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
March 5, 2020 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March 15, 2020, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from March
16, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 15, 2020, then starting March 16, 2020, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 16, 2020.
 
8.     
If, on or before March 15,
2020, the Tenant pays the amount of $23,575.00** to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March 16, 2020 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
