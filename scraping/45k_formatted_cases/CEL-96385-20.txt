In the matter
of:


5841 OLDE BASE
LINE ROAD CALEDON EAST ON
  L7C0L4


 




Between:


Maria Greco


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kelly Brownlee


Tenant



 
 
 
Maria Greco (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kelly Brownlee (the 'Tenant') because
the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on June 3, 2021.
The Landlord, the Landlord's
Legal Representative, and the Tenant attended the hearing. The Tenant spoke with Duty Counsel prior
to the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
Preliminary matter
 
1.    
The Tenant testified that she
received 2 different N12 Notices
of Termination with different termination dates, which
she found confusing.
 
2.     It is not disputed that on August 23, 2020, the
Landlord served the Tenant with an N12 Notice of Termination (N12 Notice) with
a termination date of October 31, 2020. The Landlord sought termination of the tenancy
on the ground that she required the use of the
rental unit for residential purposes.
 
3.     It is not disputed that the Landlord also sent the
Tenant a letter, dated August 23, 2020 with a cheque
for $1,400.00 dated
October 30, 2021 and a copy of an N12 notice with a
termination date of January 31, 2020.
 
4.    
The Landlord's Legal
Representative argued that the January 31, 2020 termination date was clearly a
typographical error on a draft of the N12 Notice, with the date entered as
‘31/01/2020’ instead of ‘31/10/2020,’ as it was recorded on the N12 Notice served
on the Tenant.




 
5.    
The Landlord's Legal Representative
further stated that the Tenant had not sought clarification about
the dates and had corresponded with the Landlord
by text with respect
to the Landlord’s intention to move into the rental unit on November 1,, 2020. The
Landlord’s cover letter mentioned the termination date of October 31, 2020, in
bold type, and also mentioned
that the cheque was dated October 30, 2020 in compliance with the legislation.
Section 55.1 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ’Act’) requires
that the compensation be paid no later than the termination date on the N12
Notice.
 
6.     The date on the copy of the Notice of Termination
received by the Tenant with the compensation
cheque was several
months in the past. The Tenant confirmed
that she understood that the Landlord
intended to move into the unit on November 1, 2020.
 
7.     I am not satisfied that the Tenant
was confused by the two notices. The Tenant testified that she had not believed that
the Landlord had intended to establish a termination date months in the past,
rather than the more than 60 days notice set out in original N12 Notice, as
required under the Act. The Tenant also confirmed that her communications with
the Landlord were all related to a termination date of October 31, 2020, or the
Landlord’s intended move-in date of November 1, 2020.
 
8.     Therefore, I find that the N12 Notice
served on the Tenant
on August 23, 2021 with a
termination date of October 31, 2020 is valid.
 
Good faith
 
2.     The N12 was served pursuant
to section 48 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (Act). Section 48(1) requires that, in
order to be successful in this application, the Landlord must establish that at
the time of the service of the N12 Notice, she required, in good faith, the
unit for residential use.
 
3.    
In Feeney v. Noble, 1994
CanLII 10538 (ON SC), the Court held that the test of good faith is genuine
intention to occupy the premises and not the reasonableness of the Landlord’s proposal.
This principle was upheld in Salter v. Beljinac 2001
CanLII 40231 (ON SCDC), where
the Court held that the “good faith” requirement simply means that the Landlord
sincerely intends to occupy the rental unit. The Landlord may also have
additional motives for selecting a particular rental
unit, but this does not affect the good
faith of the Landlord’s notice.”
 
4.    
In the more recent case of Fava
v. Harrison, [2014] O.J No. 2678 ONSC 3352 (Ont.Div.Ct.) the Court
determined that while the motives of the Landlord are, per Salter, “largely
irrelevant”, the Board can consider the conduct and motives of the Landlord to
draw inferences as to whether
the Landlord desires,
in good faith to occupy the property.”
 
5.    
The Landlord testified that the rental
unit is a house that she and her late husband bought for them to live in once they
retired. Her son, who lives next
door, has recently had a child. The Landlord
testified that she wants to move into the unit to be closer to her young grandchild, her church and the
community where she lived most of her life. She
has




 
been living in a condominium in Toronto, near her daughter, which has been more difficult and isolating for her since the
onset of the pandemic.
 
6.    
The Tenant questioned the Landlord’s intent
to move into the rental
unit as the Landlord has a
grandchild in Toronto as well, but she did not provide any evidence or proof
challenging the content of her affidavit or testimony.
 
7.     I am satisfied based on the Landlord’s evidence that
the Landlord genuinely intends to live in the unit for at least one year.
Therefore, I find that the Landlord in good faith requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of the
residential occupation for a
period of at least one year.
 
Compensation
 
9.    
Section 48.1 of the Act requires
a landlord to compensate a tenant in an amount
equal to one month’s rent if
the landlord, in good faith, requires the rental unit for the purpose of
residential occupation. Section 55.1 of the Act requires this compensation to
be paid no later than on the termination date specified in the notice
of termination of the tenancy. In addition, subsection 83(4) of the Act
provides that no eviction order shall be issued in a proceeding regarding
a termination of a tenancy
for the purpose
of residential occupation unless the landlord has
complied with section 48.1 of the Act.
 
10.  As noted above, the Landlord
sent a cheque to the Tenant in the amount of $1,400.00, representing one month’s
compensation dated October 30, 2020. The
Landlord submitted a copy of the cheque and letter as evidence.
 
11.  I am
satisfied that the Landlord met her obligation to pay the Tenant compensation equal to one month’s rent in accordance with section 48.1 of the
Act.
 
 
Relief from Eviction
 
12.  The Tenant has one school aged child, and two adult
children who are away from home at university. She testified that she had been having
difficulty finding a place to live that is close to her son’s school, and
affordable, with enough
space for her daughters when they are home for holidays. The Tenant
requested a delay in the eviction until her elder children had completed their
summer jobs and returned to school in September.
 
13.  I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the ‘Act’), including the Tenant’s request for a delay until
September 2021. I have also considered the Landlord’s testimony
with respect to the impact of
her current living situation on her mental health and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the
Act.
