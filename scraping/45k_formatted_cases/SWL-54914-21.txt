File Number: SWL-54914-21
 



In the matter
of:


E2, 101 TUERR DRIVE KITCHENER ON N2E2Y4


 




Between:


Victoria Park Community Homes


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Nicole
McKenzie


Tenant



 
 
Victoria Park Community
Homes (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Nicole McKenzie (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 20, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Sara Lange attended the hearing. As of 9:57 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from April
1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective May 3, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     
The lawful
monthly rent is
$1,109.00.
 
4.     
The Tenant
paid $2,500.00 after
the application was filed.
 
5.     
The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $361.24 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
 
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021
to May 3, 2021.
 
7.     
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
including the impact
of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord
attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant and, find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction
subject to the condition(s)
set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
Based on an agreement reached by the parties, the Landlord requested an order
with the conditions outlined below.
