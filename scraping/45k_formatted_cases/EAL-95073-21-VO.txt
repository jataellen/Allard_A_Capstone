Crystal-Lynn Beland


Tenant



 
 
 
 
Crystal-Lynn
Beland (the 'Tenant') filed a motion to set aside order EAL-95073-21 because,
before the eviction order was enforced, the Tenant paid the amount
required under subsection 74(11) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') to void the order.
 
This motion was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Lorrie
McCullough, attended the hearing. As of 1:26 p.m., the Tenant was not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     For the reasons
that follow, the Tenant’s motion
to void is granted, if the condition
is met.
 
2.    
The Landlord's Legal Representative does not dispute
that the Tenant
has paid
$5,786.00 to the Landlord
which technically voids
the order. However,
the Landlord I still
seeking termination of the tenancy because the Tenant is not present to present
her motion plus, she did not pay by September 28, 2021, the date specified in
the order.
Further, it is prejudicial to the Landlord
because the Tenant paid the final amount
owing, the $186.00 filing fee, after the Landlord had filed with the
Sheriff.
 
3.    
Section 74 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’) provides that a tenant
may avoid an eviction in three circumstances: before the order is issued,
section 74(2); after the
order is issued, section 74(3); and, after the order is enforceable, section
74(11).
 
4.     The sections at play here are with respect to the Tenant voiding the order “after
the order is enforceable”,
sections 74(11) through (18), which say:
 
(11)   A tenant may make a motion to the Board, on notice to the landlord,
to set aside an eviction order referred
to in subsection (3) if, after the order becomes
enforceable but before it is executed, the tenant pays an amount
to the landlord or to the Board and files an affidavit




 
sworn by the tenant stating that the amount, together
with any amounts previously paid to the landlord or to the Board, is at least
the sum of the following amounts:
1. 
The amount of rent that is in arrears under the tenancy
agreement.
2.   The amount of additional rent that would have been due under the
tenancy agreement as at the date of payment
by the tenant had notice
of termination not been
given.
3. The amount
of NSF cheque charges charged
by financial institutions to the landlord in respect of cheques
tendered to the landlord by or on behalf of the tenant,
as allowed by the Board in an
application by the landlord under section 87.
4.  The amount
of administration charges
payable by the tenant for the NSF cheques,
as allowed by the Board in an application by the landlord under section 87.
5. 
The costs ordered
by the Board.
(11.1) The Board shall refuse to accept for filing a motion under subsection (11) if
the tenant has not complied
with all the requirements of that subsection.
(12)   Subsection (11) does not apply if the tenant has previously made a
motion under that subsection during the period of the tenant’s tenancy
agreement with the landlord.
(13)   An order under subsection (3) is stayed when a motion under
subsection (11) is accepted for filing
by the Board and shall not be enforced under this Act or as an order
of the Superior Court of
Justice during the stay. Application
of subs. (13)
(13.1) For greater certainty, subsection (13) applies
only if the affidavit filed by the tenant in support of the motion under
subsection (11) complies with all the requirements of that subsection. (14) Subject to subsection (15), if a tenant
makes a motion under subsection (11), the Board shall, after a hearing,
(a)  make
an order declaring the order under subsection (3) to be void, if the tenant has
paid the amounts set out in subsection (11); or
(b)  make
an order lifting the stay of the order under subsection (3), if the tenant has
not paid the amounts set out in subsection (11).
(15)   If, on a motion under subsection (11), the Board determines that the
landlord has paid any non-refundable amount under the Administration of
Justice Act for the purpose of enforcing the order under subsection (3),
the Board shall specify that amount in the order made under clause (14) (a) and
shall provide in the order that it is not effective unless,
(a)  the
tenant pays the specified amount into the Board by a date specified in the
order; and
(b) 
an employee in the Board issues a notice under
subsection (16).
(16)   If subsection (15) applies to an order made under clause (14) (a)
and the tenant pays the amount specified in the order into the Board by the
date specified in the order, an employee in the Board shall
issue a notice to the tenant and the landlord
acknowledging that the
eviction order is void.
(17)   If subsection (15) applies to an order made under clause (14) (a)
and the tenant does not pay the amount specified in the order into the Board by
the date specified in the order, the stay of the order under subsection (3)
ceases to apply and the order may be enforced.
(18)   If the Board makes an order under
clause (14) (b), the Board may make an order that
the tenant pay to the landlord any non-refundable amount paid by the landlord
under the Administration of Justice Act for the purpose of enforcing the
order under subsection (3).
 
5.     It is undisputed that the Tenant payed the
required amount, therefore, she has complied with section 74(11) and pursuant
to section 74(11.1) there is no reason for the Board to deny the Tenant’s motion.
I am granting the motion based on the properly
filed paperwork and the fact
that the proper amount was paid; it is not necessary that the Tenant be present
for me to grant this motion under these circumstances.




 
6.     As the Landlord's Legal Representative did
not raise that the Tenant had made such a motion before, I find the Tenant has
not previously made a motion under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside an eviction order during the period of the Tenant's
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
7.     I find the Landlord has paid $316.56 under
the Administration of Justice Act for the purpose of enforcing the Landlord's eviction
order EAL-95073-21 dated September 14, 2021 and this amount is
non-refundable.
 
8.     This order contains
all the reasons
for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order EAL-95073-21 is void and cannot be enforced by the Landlord if the terms set out
in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this order are met.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay$316.56 to the Board on or before
January 21, 2021. This amount represents the non-refundable
amount the Landlord paid to enforce the eviction order.
 
3.    
If the Tenant pays the amount set out in paragraph
2 on or before January 21, 2021, then an
employee of the Board will issue a notice acknowledging that the eviction
order issued on September 14,
2021 is void.
 
4.     The amount of $314.56 paid into the Board by the Tenant
shall be paid out to the Landlord.
