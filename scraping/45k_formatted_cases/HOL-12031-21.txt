Micky Khamba and Gurmit Khamba (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Kertrella McClellan (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that
the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 24, 2022. Only the Landlords’ Legal Representative, Shalini
Puri, attended the hearing. As of 11:28 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from August 10, 2021 to February 9, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of
Termination effective September 3, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on October
24, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $2,650.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of October
24, 2021, the date the Tenant returned
vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.




File Number: HOL-12031-21
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $6,621.20*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to October 24, 2021.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing* on or before February 19, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 20,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
