Samantha Leitch
(the 'Tenant') applied
for an order determining that Tiffany Galloway
and Adib Apartments And
Suites (the 'Landlords') failed to meet the Landlords' maintenance obligations
under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') or failed to comply
with health, safety, housing or maintenance standards.
 
This application was heard
by video conference on November
3, 2021. At 10:11 am, only the
Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations and Reasons:
 
1.     The rental unit is a one-bedroom apartment
in a multi-unit complex.
 
2.    
The Tenancy
began on or about February
2020. The Tenant moved out on or about
October 1, 2020.
 
3.     The monthly rent was $1100.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant filed a T6 application on September 18, 2020 alleging;
issues with mold, cockroaches and ants, broken
basement window and broken stove hood vent.
 
5.    
As remedy
for the alleged maintenance issues,
the Tenant is seeking a rent abatement and costs to replace damaged
property.
 
T6 Application
 
Mold




 
6.    
The most serious issues
raised in the T6 application concerns mold. The Tenant submitted into evidence pictures
which show a significant amount
of mold growth
along the baseboards throughout the unit.
 
7.    
The Tenant testified that the
mold was present
from the beginning
of the tenancy and she had
informed the Landlord as early as April 2020. The Tenant purchased fans and a
dehumidifier in an attempt to remedy the situation.
 
8.    
The Tenant again informed the Landlord of the mold issue by email on July 13, 2020. The Tenant provided testimony and evidence
by way of photos that mold had developed along
the baseboard throughout the rental unit. The Landlord acknowledged the email
and indicated she would come to the unit and
assess the baseboards and mold situation.
 
9.    
The Landlord
went to the unit on July 15, 2020, inspected
the mold issue,
told the Tenant to lift her drapes and futons off
the floor due to the presence of mold. The Landlord advised the Tenant to clean
the affected areas with vinegar.
 
10. 
The Tenant over the course of several months
followed up with the Landlord
about the mold issue.
 
11.  Although
the Landlord did replace the baseboards
on our about July 17, 2020, it was the uncontested evidence of the Tenant that the Landlord
failed to investigate the reason for the mold and as such, the new
baseboards quickly became saturated again resulting in mold.
 
12.  It was the uncontested testimony and evidence of the Tenant
that the Landlord’s delayed response in dealing with the mold issue caused
significant stress and health concerns due to exposure to mold. No evidence was submitted with respect to
medical issues resulting from the presence of mold.
 
13.  The Tenant testified and provided evidence
that in early September 2020, the Landlord, in an attempt to address the
mold issue had cut the drywall about 5-6 inches from the floor up in the
affected areas. The Landlord then
left that work incomplete for several weeks despite multiple follow up attempts
from the Tenant.
 
14.  The Tenant testified that the Landlord
ceased all communication with her on or about September 2, 2020. As a result,
the Tenant attempted to communicate with the property manager with little success.
 
15. 
The Tenant
testified that on or about September 24, 2020, the property manager
sent the Tenant an email
offering termination of tenancy effective October 1, 2020.
 
Cockroaches and Ants
 
16.  The Tenant testified that on July 14, 2020
she advised the Landlord of the issue of cockroaches, ants and fruit flies in the rental
unit. The tenant
said the ants were coming in from a broken bay window and
cockroaches and fruit flies were problematic in the




 
kitchen.
 
17.  The Landlord did perform 2 treatments
following the Tenant’s complaints, on or about July 17, 2020 and the first
week in August 2020. The Tenant
said the initial
treatments were effective.
 
18.  The Tenant noted
further issues following
the treatments and contacted the Landlord on or about August 11, 2020. The Landlord acknowledged the Tenant’s
email but did not provide any further treatment nor any follow up communication
with the Tenant.
 
Broken Window
 
19. 
The Tenant testified that the broken window
resulted both in excess
moisture as well as an ant and spider problem
in the rental unit. The Tenant
testified that she verbally noted the Landlord of the broken window on or about July 17,
2020.
 
20.  It was the uncontested evidence
and testimony that the Landlord
failed to address
the broken window. The Tenant testified that she followed up on two
occasions with the Landlord with no response.
Although the email was not submitted into evidence, the Tenant read the
correspondence into the record on the date of the hearing.
 
Stove Hood Vent
 
21.  Following
a complaint to the Landlord
from the Tenant
about the broken
hood vent over the stove, the Landlord did replace
it. The Tenant was satisfied that the
Landlord had responded to this issue and withdrew this allegation.
 
 
Analysis and Remedy
 
22. 
I find that the Landlord failed to meet its obligations under s.20(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘ACT’) which states:
 
A landlord is
responsible for providing and maintaining a residential complex, including the rental
units in it, in a good state of repair and fit for habitation and for complying with health, safety, housing and maintenance standards.
 
23.  Based on the evidence provided
by the Tenant, there were clearly ongoing
problems with the mold, pests and broken window. Despite
multiple attempts made the
Tenant over the course of several months, little if any effective or
substantive work was done by the Landlords. In addition, these maintenance
breaches made the rental unit uncomfortable for the Tenant. Having considered these circumstances, I
find that a rent abatement equal to 30% of rent is appropriate.
 
24.  Pursuant to s.29(2) of the Act, the Board
may award a remedy (such as a rent abatement)
for the timeframe calculated from one year prior to the application filing date. The
Tenant filed the T6 application on September 18, 2020. Therefore, the timeframe used for the remedy calculation is
April through to and including September 2020 (6




 
months).
 
25. 
Given the amount of issues experienced by the Tenant and reported
to the Landlord, the Landlord shall pay to the Tenant
a rent abatement of $2640.00. This amount represents approximately 40% of the
monthly rent for the period as described in paragraph 24.
 
26.  The
Tenant is seeking
a remedy of $290.00 for the replacement of 2 futons and drapes. Based on my knowledge of similar cases, I find this to
be a reasonable valuation.
 
27.  Based on the testimony of the Tenant,
I find on a balance
of probabilities that the drapes and futons were damaged by mold
and the Tenant will be compensated accordingly in the amount of $290.00.
 
28.  This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlords shall
pay to the Tenant a rent abatement
of $2640.00.
 
2.    
The Landlords
shall also pay to the Tenant $290.00. This represents the costs that the
Tenant will incur in replacing property that was damaged as a result of the
Landlords' failure to repair the rental unit and comply with applicable
standards.
 
3.     The Landlords shall pay to the Tenant $48.00 for the
cost to file the application.
 
4.     The total amount
the Landlords owe the Tenant
is $2978.00.
 
5.     The Landlords shall pay the Tenant the full amount
owing by February
15, 2022.
 
6.    
If the Landlords do not
pay the Tenant the full amount owing by February 15, 2022 the Landlords will owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 16, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
 
7.    
The Tenant
has the right,
at any time, to collect
the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
