Order under Section 78(6)

File Number: SWL-57612-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


501, 872
WILLIAM STREET LONDON ON
  N5Y2S4


 




Between:


London &
Middlesex Community Housing


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Davina Stringer


Tenant



 
 
 
On January 18, 2022, London &
Middlesex Community Housing (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Davina Stringer (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have
the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because
the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on May 20, 2021 with
respect to application SWL-40485-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order: The Tenant shall keep the rental unit in a state of ordinary cleanliness and free from pet
waste, such condition to remain in effect until one year from May 20, 2021.
 
3.     The Landlord’s declaration states that on December 22, 2021 the unit was inspected with proper notice given to the Tenant
and her support agency. It was found that the Tenant was in contravention of
the terms of the consent order and she did not keep her unit in a state of reasonable cleanliness. The unit was in a state of squalor with cigarette butts and
ashes covering the furniture and floors of the sleeping and living areas. There
is graffiti covering the inside of the unit door, walls, including a giant
“fuck you” spray painted on the wall. The kitchen stove top and counters
were filthy, with dirty water and dishes
in the sink and an overflowing garbage bag open on the kitchen floor. A kitchen
drawer was missing its front and the bathroom vanity was also missing its
doors. It was evident the bathroom floor, toilet,
bathtub and vanity
counter had not been cleaned
in some time.
The balcony was cluttered with items and garbage. The mattress in the
sleeping area was heavily stained and it appeared that even the Tenant would
not sleep on it, as a make- shift bed was set up in a recliner in the living
area of the unit. At the top of the mattress, clothing and other items were
packed in between the wall and the mattress. There was




 
evidence of a cockroach
infestation in the unit, but despite the landlord ordering
pest control of the unit would hinder a successful pest control
treatment.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $330.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021 to February 2, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SWL-40485-20 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 13, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$19.50 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 3, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
13, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 14, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 13, 2022, then starting February
14, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 14, 2022.
