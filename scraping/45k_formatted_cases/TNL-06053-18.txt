            Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
 
File
Number: TNL-06053-18



 


 


 



 
SS (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict AN, ES and ES (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was
heard in Toronto on July 6, 2018.
 
The
Landlord and the Tenant, AN attended the hearing.
ML
represented the Landlord.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from April 1, 2018 to July 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective June 17, 2018.
2.      The
Tenant, AN did not dispute that the rent was outstanding for May, June and
July, 2018 as claimed. In addition, having dismissed the Landlord’s own use
application (TNL-05099-18), the Tenant is no longer entitled to one months’
compensation. In the result, four month’s rent is outstanding, in the total
amount of $4,200.00. 
3.      The
Tenant submitted that he should not be required to pay the $175.00 application
filing fee. As stated at the hearing, an applicant is generally entitled to
the cost of filing their application where the application is made out. In this
case there is no dispute that there were arrears when the application was
filed. The Tenant stated that the Landlord refused a rental payment in May so
he did not try to pay rent after that. The termination date in the N4 is June
17, 2018. There was no evidence that the Tenant was prevented in any way from
voiding the N4 by paying what was owed by that date. In the result, the
Landlord is entitled to payment of their filing fee.  
4.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,050.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from December 1,
2016 to June 17, 2018.
6.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), in
particular that the Tenant AN indicated that he could pay right away, and find
that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.
It is
ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before July 20, 2018.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $2,370.21*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to July 9, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $34.52 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting July 10, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before July
20, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from July 21, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before July 20, 2018, then starting July 21,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 21, 2018.
8.      If,
on or before July 20, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $4,375.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction
may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after July 21, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
