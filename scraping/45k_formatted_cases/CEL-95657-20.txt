File Number: CEL-95657-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


153, 7555 GOREWAY DRIVE MISSISSAUGA ON L4T3M9


 




Between:


Elder Gardens Apartments


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Sukai Jeng


Tenant



 
 
 
Elder Gardens Apartments (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Sukai Jeng (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes. The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict the Tenant because the Tenant was persistently late paying her rent.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on October 14, 2021. The Landlord’s agent Estelle Epstein
(‘EE’) and the Landlord’s legal representative, Bryan Rubin, attended
the hearing. The Tenant’s
mother, Suzette Kerr (‘SK’), attended the hearing on behalf of the Tenant.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord had sold the rental unit prior to the
hearing and was no longer seeking an order terminating this tenancy. The only item that was in dispute
was whether the Tenant
owed the Landlord arrears of rent.
 
2.     At the hearing the parties agreed that the only amount
in dispute was $1,591.00. The Tenant’s position was that it was paid on June 8, 2020. The Landlord’s position was that this payment was never received, and
the Landlord was therefore owed $1,591.00 and the cost of filing this
application.
 
3.     The Landlord submitted
a copy of its ledger
for the rental unit and the Landlord’s bank account statement between June 7, 2020 and June 12, 2020.
Neither of the two documents had a credit of $1,591.00 on June 8, 2020. The
Landlord’s bank account shows a credit of $1,591.00 on June 11, 2020 which
according to the Landlord represented a payment made by the Tenant on that
date.
 
4.    
Parties agreed that there was a
payment attempt on June 10, 2020
that was cancelled and never
received by the Landlord, and that a payment of $1,591.00 was successfully
made by the Tenant on June 11, 2020.




 
5.    
The Landlord’s evidence was that the Tenant made her payments
by e-transfers and that
if the Landlord didn’t get the password right 3 times in a row, the Landlord
was no longer able to deposit it. The Landlord’s witness did not specifically
testify that this is what happened with June 8, 2020 payment.
 
6.    
SK submitted a copy of her bank statements
from Scotiabank and from BMO. The Tenant’s evidence was that she paid $1,591.00 to the Landlord
on June 8 and on June
11. This is consistent with her account
statements which show these amounts
being withdrawn on these dates and a corresponding decrease in her
account balance.
 
7.     SK also submitted a copy of a letter from the Bank of
Nova Scotia dated April 5, 2021. The letter shows a history of Interac e-transfers made by SK between
June 8, 2020 and June 11, 2020. The letter shows two e-transfers dated June 8,
2020 and June 11, 2020 for $1,591.00
as “Completed” and “Deposited” on the date they were sent. It also
shows an e-transfer dated June 10, 2020 for the amount of $1,591.00 as
“Cancelled”. The “Deposited” cell corresponding to the June 10 payment
is blank indicating that it was not
deposited. All three payments were sent to the same email address: shirley@ewmanagement.com.
The Landlord did not challenge the authenticity of this letter from the Bank of
Nova Scotia.
 
8.     The Landlord bears the burden of proof in this
application. Based on the evidence adduced at the hearing I am unable to find
that it is more likely than not that the Tenant did not make a payment on June
8, 2020. The Tenant’s evidence that this payment was made is compelling and is consistent throughout the various
documents submitted by the
Tenant. Specifically, the letter from Bank of Nova Scotia confirms the dates of
the payments, the amounts, the email address they were sent to, and whether
they were deposited.
 
9.     I have no reason to doubt EE’s credibility. I am,
nevertheless, unable to prefer the Landlord’s evidence that the June 8 payment
was never received over the Tenant’s specific evidence about her June 8, 2020
payment being made to the correct email address, withdrawn from her account, and deposited on June 8, 2020 according to the Bank of Nova
Scotia letter.
 
10.  I do not find that it is more likely
than not that the Tenant
owes the Landlord
$1,591.00 as claimed by the
Landlord. The Landlord’s application is therefore dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord's application is dismissed.
