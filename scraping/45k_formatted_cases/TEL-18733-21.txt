and


 




 


Tammy Clarke


Tenant



 
IMH Pool XV LP (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tammy Clarke (the
'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes
because the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the mediated settlement issued by the Board on June 18, 2021 with respect to
application TEL-13599-20.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved by ex parte order TEL-18733-21, issued on August 20, 2021. The Tenant filed a motion to set
aside order TEL-18733-21.
 
This motion was heard
by videoconference on January 21, 2022.
 
The Tenant and the Landlord’s Legal
Representative, Tricia Radam, attended the hearing. The Tenant consulted with the Tenant Duty
Counsel prior to the commencement of the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant testified concerning the circumstances which contributed to her breaching the payment terms of the mediated settlement dated June 18,
2021.
 
2.     She testified that due to a car accident she was in, she lost her full-time
job. The Tenant stated she was still waiting for an
insurance claim to come in (approximately $4,000.00 anticipated). As well, in November 2021, the Tenant
indicated she had recovered from the accident and was cleared to work. She testified she started a new job in
December 2021, earning about $1,160.00 every two weeks. The Tenant did not adduce any evidence in support of her
testimony.
 
3.    
The Landlord’s Legal Representative submitted that since the L4 application was filed on August, 5, 2021, the Tenant have made no payments of rent or arrears to the Landlord
to the date of this motion hearing.          The Legal Representative
indicated that the Tenant’s arrears account has grown from over $21,000.00 in
August 2021 to a current amount nearing $35,000.00 to January 31, 2022.
 
4.     The Tenant submitted
she has lived at the
rental unit for 18 years, currently with her 2 adult children
(one working, one in school).
The Tenant did not provide
any testimony




File Number: TEL-18733-21-SA
 
regarding why she
has made no payments at all since August 2021. She stated
that she would like to maintain
her tenancy but understood she owes the Landlord a lot of money;
as a result, the Tenant indicated
she has been looking for another
place to move to, and would like to
end of February 2022 to do so.
 
5.     The Landlord’s Legal Representative acknowledged the tenancy has been a longstanding
one, and so the Landlord would be willing to wait until February 28, 2022 for a
lifting of the stay of the ex
parte order.
 
6.     Based on the submissions of the Tenant and then the
Landlord, I provided my determination to the parties present that I was not
persuaded by the Tenant to grant her motion to set aside. While the circumstances of a car accident and lost employment were accepted by me for the initial breaches of the mediated
settlement, the Tenant did not provide any submissions or proof in respect of
the zero-payments since August 2021, even with the Tenant reportedly starting
to work full-time in December 2021. There
was also nothing reasonable submitted to consider in respect of maintaining the
tenancy and as such, I find the motion to set aside is to be denied, and stay
of the ex parte order will be lifted on February 28, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The motion to set aside order TEL-18733-21, issued on August 20, 2021, is denied.
 
2.     The stay of order TEL-18733-21 is lifted on February 28, 2022.
