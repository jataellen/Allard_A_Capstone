Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-36588-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


6, 103 BLACKFRIAR AVENUE TORONTO ON M9R3S8


 




Between:


Antonio Villella


Landlord




 


 
And


 




 


Donovan Smith


Tenant



 
 
 
Antonio Villella (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Donovan Smith (the
'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes
because the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on December 20, 2021 with respect to application
TNL-34520-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following condition specified in the order: The
Tenant did not pay $1630.00 rent in full on or before January 15, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the
payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $4,706.00 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order TNL-34520-21. The amount that is still owing from that
order is $0.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order TNL-34520-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing.
 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,575.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.




 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021 to February 7, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order TNL-34520-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 18, 2022.
 
3.     As of the date of this order, the Tenant owes no money
to the Landlord because the amount of the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the
arrears of rent, that the Landlord is entitled to under this order by $571.45, in addition
to any amounts that the Tenant has paid to the Landlord since this application
was filed on January 24, 2022.
 
4.     The Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenant:
$54.23 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 8,
2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit;
 
5.     The Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 18, 2022, then starting
February 19, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 19, 2022.
