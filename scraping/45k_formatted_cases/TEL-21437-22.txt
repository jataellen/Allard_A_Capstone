Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-21437-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


88
  RIDGE ROAD CAMBRIDGE ON N3E0C6


 




Between:


Bhajan Singh
Kalsi


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Lina Fonseca Trumaine Kyte


Tenants



 
 
 
Bhajan Singh Kalsi (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Trumaine
Kyte and Lina Fonseca (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay
the rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on December 31, 2021 with
respect to application HOL-11864-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants have not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenants did not pay $2100.00
rent on or before January
15, 2022. The Tenants did not pay $4000.00 arrears in full on
or before January 31, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $13,086.00 for rent arrears
and the costs related to the Landlord's
application fee in Order HOL-11864-21. The amount that is still owing from that order
is $5,586.00 and that amount
is included in this order.
As a result, the previous order HOL-11864-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order,
the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from January 15, 2022 to February 14, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,100.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from February
11, 2019 to February 25, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order HOL-11864-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before March 8, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$5,537.67*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to February 25, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$69.04 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 26,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before March 8, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 9, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 8, 2022, then starting March 9, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 9, 2022.
 
 
February 25, 2022

The tenant has until March 7, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by March 7, 2022 the order
will be stayed and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on September 9, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this
date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction
