Tenant



 
 
 
Galaxy Real
Estate Core Ontario Property (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Michael Salansky (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have
the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant
owes because the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified in the order
issued by the Board on August 31, 2021 with respect to application
TSL-20566-21.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved
by order TSL-24307-21, issued on October
14, 2021. The Tenant filed a
motion to set aside order TSL-24307-21.
 
This motion was heard by video conference on December 14, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord’s legal representative, M. Forrester, attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant
did not attend
the hearing scheduled for 1 p.m. I waited
until 1:55 p.m.,
and then I proceeded to hear the matter on an uncontested basis.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s legal representative said that the Tenant has paid all the arrears,
and his account balance is
zero to December 31, 2021.
 
3.    
Consequently, the Landlord’s legal representative said that the Landlord consents
to the Tenant’s motion to set
aside the eviction order TSL-24307-21, issued on October 14, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order TSL-24307-21, issued on October
14, 2021, is set aside.
 
2.     The Landlord's application under section 78 of the Act is dismissed.
