File Number: TSL-19907-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


305, 105 ISABELLA STREET TORONTO ON M4Y1N9


 




Between:


Raamco Int'l Properties Canadian Ltd


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Carlos
Maia Cabral


Tenant



 
 
 
Raamco Int'l
Properties Canadian Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Carlos Maia Cabral
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that
the Tenant owes.
 
The Landlord
also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Carlos
Maia Cabral (the 'Tenant') because he has been
persistently late in paying his rent.
 
The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on July 27, 2021
at 9:00 a.m.
 
Only the Landlord, represented by Franki
Dash, a Lawyer, attended the hearing.
As at 11:10 a.m., the Tenant, Carlos Maia Cabral, was not present or represented at the hearing
though being properly served with the Notice of Hearing by the Board.
The hearing
proceeded without the Tenant at 11:10 a.m.
Determinations:
L1
application
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
October 1, 2020 to July 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective November
17, 2020.
 
2.    
The Tenants
were in possession of the rental unit when the application was filed.




 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,361.00
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,333.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 1, 2020 to November 17, 2020.
 
6.    
The Tenant
paid $4,400.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.    
As of the hearing
date, the Tenant owed the Landlord, $9,431.00
including arrears of rent
to July 31, 2021 of $9,210.00, N.S.F. charges of $20.00 and the application fee
of
$201.00. Since
the hearing, another six rental periods have begun, and six
more month’s rent have become
due. Therefore, the amount in this order includes August 2021, September 2021,
October 2021, November 2021, December 2021 and January 2022’s rent. If the
Tenant has paid the Landlord August 2021, September 2021, October 2021, November
2021, December 2021 and January 2022’s rent, and /or made any payments to the
Landlord since the hearing, the Landlord shall deduct those payments from the
amount owing in this order.
 
8.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
The Tenant did not attend the
hearing to present evidence or submissions in support of granting relief from eviction
and no circumstances were disclosed at the hearing or appeared in the
Board file.
 
L2 application
 
 
9.    
The rent is
due on the first of
each month
 
10.  The Tenant has been late paying the rent 31 times in the last 31 months.
 
11.  The Landlord has served the Tenant with 8 Form N4 – “Notice to End a Tenancy Early
for Non-payment of Rent”
 
 
It is
ordered that:
 
L1 application
 
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 16, 2022.




 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$14,896.62*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to
January 5, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $44.75
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 6, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
16, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January
17, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 17, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 16, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $17,577.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would
not be terminated and the Tenant could
remain in the unit. If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this
order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
17, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
 
L2 application
 
 
10.  If the Tenant voids the order for eviction
under the L1 application pursuant
to paragraph 8 of this order,
then the following condition shall apply:
 
a)    
The Tenant
shall pay the full monthly
rent on or before the first
day of each month, commencing September 1st, 2021 and for 12 months thereafter up to and
including September August 1st, 2022.
 
11.
If the Tenant fails to comply
with the conditions set out in paragraph

of the breach, the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order terminating the tenancy and
