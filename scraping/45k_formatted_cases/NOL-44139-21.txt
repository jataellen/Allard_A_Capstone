File Number: NOL-44139-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


182 BIGGINGS
  AVENUE
SAULT STE. MARIE
ON P6A3T9


 




Between:


Paul Mundy


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Cindy Semczyszyn Dave (perry) Hoover
L Y N N ( D O N A L D A ) M C K E N N A


Tenants



 
 
 
Paul Mundy (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict L Y N N ( D O N A L D A ) M C K E N
N A, Cindy Semczyszyn and Dave (perry)
Hoover (the 'Tenants') because they, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have wilfully
or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises.
The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the
Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the damage; and because they, another occupant of the rental unit
or someone they permitted in the residential complex have substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for
each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 988 4914 7021# on January
10, 2022. The Landlord
represented by Francis Ibana, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord introduced
as evidence a series of photographs showing the extensive damage that has been caused to the rental
unit. The Landlord
will be required
to replace the banister on
the staircase, repair the extensive damage done to the plaster walls, replace
the baseboards that have been torn off, replace the laminate flooring and
carpeting that have been torn out and piled on the floor, as well as repairing
and replacing the kitchen cabinets and doors that have been damaged and torn
off. The Landlord will also need to
replace the two-year washer and dryer as well as repair or replace the damage
refrigerator.
 
2.    
Based on the testimony
and the photographs introduced as evidence, I find The Tenants,
an occupant of the rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex
by the Tenants have wilfully or negligently
caused undue damage to the rental unit.




 
3.    
The Landlord
will incur costs
exceeding the $6,000.00
claimed in the application to repair
the damage and replace property that was damaged
and cannot be reasonably repaired.
 
4.    
This conduct
substantially interferes with a lawful
right, privilege or interest of the
Landlord.
 
5.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated, as of January
24, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 24, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$6,000.00, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage and
replacing the damaged property.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$6,312.00, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from September 16,
2021 to January 13, 2022.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $52.60 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from January 14, 2022 to
the date they move out of the unit.
 
5.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
6.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before January 24, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 25, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
7.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 24, 2022, then starting January
25, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 25, 2022.
