2532958 Ontario Limited (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Steve Skok and Greg Skok (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the
rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January

represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.

were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective September 20, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on
November 4, 2021. The Tenants
were in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $2,496.95.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:

3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.

the full amount
owing* on or before February
