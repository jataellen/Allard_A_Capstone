and


 




 


Jacob Kendrick-Metcalfe


Tenant



 
John Lammers and Adrian Bult (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Jacob Kendrick-Metcalfe (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 1, 2022. Only the Landlords attended the hearing. As of 1:59 p.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from October 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of
Termination effective October 16, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on December
5, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,295.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,295.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlords.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from July 23, 2021 to
October 16, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy is terminated as of December
5, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.




File Number: SOL-25400-21
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlords $1,514.91*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to December
5, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing* on or before February 18, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 19,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
