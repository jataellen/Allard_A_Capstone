ROAD

Emily Horner
Wasson Kevin Racette


Tenants




 
 
 
Alexandra
Cremonese (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Kevin Racette and Emily Horner Wasson (the 'Tenants') because they,
another occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the
residential complex have wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlord
for the damage. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 1, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord’s Agent, Amanda Somerville, the Landlord's Legal Representative, Kristen
Ley, and the Landlord’s maintenance person, Sean McClay, attended the
hearing. As of 11:56 a.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
On July 7, 2021, the Tenant
Emily Horner Wasson (‘EHW’) fell asleep in the bathtub
with the water running. This caused extensive flooding and damage to the
unit below.
 
2.    
The Landlord
submitted several pictures
of the damage showing extensive
water damage to the floors,
walls and paint to the unit below. The Landlord repaired the damage in October
2021. The Landlord submitted an invoice in the amount of $8,316.80 for the
repair costs and pictures of the completed repairs.
 
3.    
The Tenants
were in possession of the rental
unit when the application was filed with the
Board.
 
4.    
The Tenants
vacated the rental
unit on September 29, 2021. Accordingly, this order is for
the cost of repairs only and not eviction.

5.    
Subsection 89(1) of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) says “a landlord may apply
to the Board for an order requiring a tenant to pay reasonable costs that the
landlord has incurred or will incur for the repair of or, where repairing is
not reasonable, the replacement of damaged property,
if the tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit
or a person whom the tenant
permits in the residential complex
wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to the rental unit or the residential
complex and the tenant is in possession of the rental unit.”
 
6.    
Based on the evidence
before me, I am satisfied that the EHW negligently caused the damage by falling asleep
in the bathtub with the water running.
This was the direct cause of the resulting damage. I am also
satisfied, based on the pictures and my experience with the Board, that the invoice representing the repair costs are reasonable and that
the Landlord has incurred these costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$8,316.80, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the
full amount owing on or before January 17, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 18, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
