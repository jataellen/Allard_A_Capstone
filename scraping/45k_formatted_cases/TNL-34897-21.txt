In the matter
of:


BASEMENT, 192 SILVERBIRCH DRIVE NEWMARKET ON L3Y2Z5


 




Between:


Ahmad Hassanzadeh Esfahani


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Dannica Elizabe Langlais


Tenant



 
 
 
Ahmad Hassanzadeh Esfahani
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dannica Elizabe Langlais (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
way of video conference on January 17, 2022.
The Landlord attended the hearing
and was represented by Katy Sanaye,
Paralegal. The Tenant
attended the hearing and was
self represented.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
23, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,300.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
3.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from March 25, 2021 to September 23, 2021.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since the filing of the application.
 
5.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit of January
1, 2022.
 
6.    
At the hearing the Tenant attempted to raise of number of concerns pursuant
to section 82 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the Act):
 
82 (1) At a hearing of an application by a landlord under section
69 for an order terminating a tenancy
and evicting a tenant based
on a notice of termination




 
under section
59, the Board
shall permit the tenant to raise any issue that could
be the subject of an application made by the tenant under this Act if the tenant,
 
(a)    
complies with the requirements set out in subsection (2); or
(b)    
provides an explanation satisfactory to the Board explaining why the tenant could not comply with the requirements
set out in subsection (2)
 
(2) The requirements referred
to in subsection (1) are the following:
 
1.   The tenant shall give advance
notice to the landlord of the tenant’s
intent to raise the issue at
the hearing.
2.   
The notice shall be given within
the time set out in the Rules.
3.   
The notice shall be given in writing and shall comply
with the Rules.
 
7.    
In accordance with section 82(2)
of the Act, the Board’s
Rules of Procedure provide as follows:
 
19.4. Unless the LTB has directed or ordered otherwise, a tenant who intends to raise
issues under sections 82(1) or 87(2) of the
RTA during a hearing for a
landlord’s application about rent arrears shall provide the other parties and
the LTB with the following at least 7 days before the scheduled CMH or hearing:
 
1. a written description of each issue the tenant
intends to raise;
and
2. a copy of all documents, pictures
and other evidence
that the tenant
intends to rely upon at the hearing.
 
8.    
The Tenant failed
to comply with the notice / disclosure requirements of Rule 19.4. As of the date of the hearing, the Tenant had not filed with the Board or served on the Landlord a list of issues to be raised or
any evidence to support their section 82 concerns. The Tenant was unable to provide any explanation as to why she
did not comply with Rule
19.4 of the Act.
 
9.    
Therefore, the Tenant is not entitled
to raise section
82 issues and the matter
proceeded to hear the Landlord’s claim for non-payment of rent only.
 
10. 
The Tenant
disputed the amount of rent arrears owing stating that she paid the September 2021 rent by way of e-transfer on September 1, 2021.
The Tenant did not submit any receipt of payment, bank records, confirmation from
the Landlord that the funds were
received or any other evidence to support the assertion that she paid the
September 2021 rent. The Landlord
denies that any funds were received.




 
11. 
In Mauti v.
Gibbs, 2019 ONSC 3355 (CanLII), the Divisional Court held at paragraph 27 that
while the Landlord bears the burden of proof in a rent arrears application, it
is it is difficult for a landlord to prove a negative (i.e. non-payment of rent). Therefore, “. . .while the ultimate persuasive burden
never shifts, once a landlord denies receiving funds, the tenant will have an
evidentiary burden or a chance to advance some evidence to positively prove
that he or she paid rent.”
 
12. 
On a balance of
probabilities, I find that the Tenant owes to the Landlord rent for the months of August 2021 through to January 2022. I accept
the Landlord’s evidence
of non-payment, and as stated, the Tenants provided no evidence
supporting that the disputed payments were made to the Landlord.
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated on January 1, 2022, the day possession was returned to the
Landlord.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4,556.35*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 1, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before March 1, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 2, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
