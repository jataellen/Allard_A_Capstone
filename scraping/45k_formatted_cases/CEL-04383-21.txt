Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-04383-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


29, 80 VICTORIA STREET MEAFORD ON N4L1R7


 




Between:


Grey County
  Housing


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Skylar Finch


Tenant



 
 
 
Grey County Housing (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Skylar Finch (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition
specified in the order
issued by the Board on November 15, 2021 with respect to application
CEL-02040-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order: the Tenant
agreed that for a 12 month period commencing on November 4, 2021, they would
not engage in any excessive noise within the rental unit. On December 23, 2021,
the Landlord received multiple reports of excessive noise coming from the Tenant’s unit over
night and early morning hours. This escalated into screaming and a fight at
which point the police were called and the Tenant was ultimately removed. This
event constitutes a serious breach of the previous order issued by the Board.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 29, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before January 29, 2022, then starting January
30, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.




File Number: CEL-04383-21
 
3.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 30, 2022.

The tenant has until January 28, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 28, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.
 
If you have any questions about this order,
call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.
 
In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on July 30, 2022 if
the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
