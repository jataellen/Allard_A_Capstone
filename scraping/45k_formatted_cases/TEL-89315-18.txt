S.C. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict M.L. and D.L. (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Whitby on April 23,
2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant D.L.,
on behalf of both Tenants attended the hearing.
 
 Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent they were required to pay for the period from February 15, 2018
to March 14, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective March 7, 2018.
2.     
The Tenants paid $700.00
after the application was filed.
3.     
At the hearing the Tenant
explained that the Tenants fell into arrears as his wife lost her employment 5
months ago. He testified that as of the date of the hearing she had secured new
employment as a house cleaner. He testified that her new position will generate
$2200 a month in take home income, however he did not know the name of her
employer, nor did he bring any supporting evidence of employment or income. 
4.     
The Tenant testified that he
earns $2500 a month from his employment at Costco. No supporting documents were
provided at the hearing. The Tenant provided generally vague evidence around
the household finances when asked, indicating that .M.L. has all the
information.
5.     
The Tenant proposed a
repayment plan. The problem with the repayment plan is that it did not include
the monthly rent that will come due throughout the repayment period. If the new
rent is factored into the repayment plan, the Tenants will be paying monthly
more than they earn together. This does not factor in the four children that
live with them and all the other daily expenses. The repayment plan proposed
was not accepted by the Landlord, for good reason.
6.     
The Tenant was asked about
his living situation. He lives with Ms. L. and they have four children between
them. Three adult children and one four year old who attends kindergarten.
7.     
The Tenant testified that he
felt that eviction should be denied as he always ended up paying his arrears
eventually. He feels that the Landlord should wait for his payment until the
summer when the Tenant can make extra money in construction.
8.     
The Landlord, however,
believes that the Tenants cannot actually afford living in the unit, and is not
prepared to wait any longer for rental income necessary to maintain the
property. He cannot finance the Tenants lifestyle.
9.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances above in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
10.  
There is no convincing
evidence before the Board establishing that the Tenants can afford the rental
unit based on their combined incomes. The repayment plan proposed by the
Tenants does not address new rent as it becomes due and in fact, they cannot
afford to pay the rent and the arrears simultaneously based on the numbers
provided at the hearing.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before May 6,
2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $3,951.35*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to April 25, 2018.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $70.95 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting April 26, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May 6, 2018, the Tenants will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from May 7,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
5.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before May 6, 2018, then starting May 7, 2018, the Landlord may file this
order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
6.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 7, 2018.
7.     
If, on or before May 6,
2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $5,458.89** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after May 7, 2018
but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
