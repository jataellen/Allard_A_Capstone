Centurion Property Associates Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Giovanna Rodrigues and Isaac Da Silva (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe. The Landlord
also claimed administration charges related to NSF cheques.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
12, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Faith
McGregor, attended the hearing. As
of 10:50 a.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the
Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total
rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from May 1, 2021 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 30, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants vacated the rental unit on
October 31, 2021. The Tenants
were in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,630.00.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord waives the $60.00
NSF administration charges.
