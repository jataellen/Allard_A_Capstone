Kenni-jo Delaney Lawrence Delaney


Tenants



 
 
 
Claude Lauzon
Holdings (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Lawrence Delaney and Kenni-jo Delaney (the 'Tenants') because they,
another occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the
residential complex have wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlord
for the damage.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021 at 9:49 AM.
 
Only the Landlord’s agents,
Michel Lauzon and Lynn Lauzon,
attended the hearing.
The Tenants were not present or represented, but were properly
served with a Notice of Hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s application is based on an N5 Notice
of Termination, given under section 62 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”), alleging that the Tenants, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential
complex have wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises, in
particular relating to undue damage arising from tobacco smoke. The N5 was served on August 19, 2021, with
a termination date of September 8, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
have since vacated
the residential unit, having returned
the keys on August
31, 2021. The part of the application
seeking eviction is accordingly moot.
 
3.    
The Landlord’s
application also claimed $3,714.25 under section 89 of the Act for reasonable
costs that the landlord has incurred from the Tenants’ wilfully or negligently
causing undue damage to the rental unit or the residential complex.
The application was filed with the Board on August 27, 2021, while
the Tenants were still in possession of the
rental unit.




 
4.    
The Landlord
seeks damage for a broken door, as well as extensive damage
to the unit caused by tobacco smoke.
The smoke-damaged items were enumerated in the application as follows:
4 STOVE RINGS,
6 STOVE BUTTONS, 1 STOVE HUT FAN -EDGES OF THE KITCHEN CABINETS -3 CEILING
DIFFUSERS -1 BEDROOM DOOR -1 NEW REFRIGERATOR -3 PLUGS AND COVER PLATES -2
SWITCH -1 SWITCH COVER DOUBLE GANG -1 THERMOSTAT -1 RETURN GRILL -1 DEHUMIDIFIER
- REGROUT
KITCHEN TILE -CLEANING, FLOORING GROUT (DEEP
STEAM CLEANING) - PAINT WALLS AND CEILING WITH 3 GALLONS OF SPECIAL
PAINT TO COVER AND ELIMINATE THE SMOKE STAINS AND ODOUR.
 
5.    
The Landlord submitted
extensive photographs as evidence shoring the extent of discolouration of fixtures
and damaged door that required
repair or replacement, as well as
post-repair images. Specialist paint
was required in repainting the rental unit to contain the tobacco smell.
 
6.    
The Landlord’s evidence
was that the Tenants smoked extensively
in the rental unit, and that in addition
to the discolouration, the smell
of tobacco smoke
was overpowering. The tenancy agreement did not prohibit
smoking, therefore as noted during the hearing, the degree to which the damage
is “undue” (a pre-requisite for me to grant compensation) was a live question, as a
certain amount of smoke smell or residue is an inevitable result
of smoking within the unit. The
Landlord’s agents indicated that the degree of damage and consequent repair was
well above a normal smoking unit, and occasioned by the Tenants failure to
clean the unit to prevent undie accumulation of tobacco residue.
 
7.    
I am therefore
satisfied that the damage accordingly arises not just from the deliberate act of smoking, but also the negligent act
of the Tenants failing to keep the rental unit clean. The former act was not prohibited by the lease, and in my view could therefore not in isolation sustain a claim for compensation under section
89. But the Tenants are required
under section 33 of the Act for ordinary cleanliness of the rental unit. In the circumstances proven by the
Landlord, the damage caused by the Tenants’ omission in meeting this obligation
is negligence, which has caused undue damage to the unit.
 
8.    
It is unclear whether
the damage to the door was caused
negligently or deliberately, but I am satisfied
that the damage was undue.
 
9.    
The Tenants
have therefore negligently caused undue damage
to the rental unit by
damage caused by tobacco smoke and damage to a door.
 
10.  The receipts and invoices submitted
by the Landlord for repair are well in excess of
$4,000, although
the amount claimed on the application was only $3,714.25. No amendment to the application was served prior
to the hearing, and as the Tenants
were not present, I am
not satisfied that amending the amount upward
without notice to them
would be fair and consistent with Rule 15.4 of this Board’s Rules of Procedure.
 
11.  The Landlord has incurred costs in
excess of $3,714.25 to repair the damage
and replace the damaged property,
and is accordingly awarded the full amount sought in its application.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$3,714.25, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage and
replacing the damaged property.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before January 22, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 23, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
