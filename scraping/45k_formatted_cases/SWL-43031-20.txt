Joseph Scott Michelle Scott


Tenants




 
 
 
Skyline Living (the 'Landlord') applied for an order requiring Michelle Scott and Joseph
Scott (the 'Tenants') of a superintendent’s premises,
because the Tenants’
employment as superintendents has ended. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after
the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 6, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Gail Kukor Lang, attended the hearing. As of 10 a.m.,
the Tenants were not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants terminated their employment with the Landlord
on February 24, 2020. The Tenants did not vacate the
superintendent's premises within one week since their employment was
terminated.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the superintendent’s premises on May 6, 2020. The Tenants were in possession of the superintendent’s
premises on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The Landlord is seeking daily compensation for the Tenants’
use of the unit commencing March 4, 2020 to May 6, 2020.
 
4.     The relevant sections
of the of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’) provide as follows:




 
93.  
(1) If a landlord has entered into
a tenancy agreement with respect to a superintendent’s premises, unless otherwise agreed, the tenancy
terminates on the day on which the employment of the tenant
is terminated.
 
(2) 
A
tenant shall vacate
a superintendent’s premises
within one week after his or her tenancy is terminated.
 
(3) 
A
landlord shall not charge a tenant rent or compensation or receive rent or compensation from a tenant with
respect to the one-week period mentioned in subsection (2).
 
94.   
The landlord may apply to the
Board for an order terminating the tenancy of a tenant of superintendent’s premises
and evicting the tenant if the tenant
does not vacate
the rental unit within
one week of the termination of his or her employment.
 
5.     Section 93(2) of the Act makes it clear that
superintendents must vacate the unit within one week after employment ends.
When a tenant does not vacate a superintendent unit pursuant to the Act, a landlord
is entitled to file an application under section 94 of the Act
to seek to terminate the tenancy.
 
6.     While section 93(3) of the Act states that the landlord cannot charge a tenant any rent for the first seven days after the
termination of their employment, there is no mention in this section of whether
the landlord is entitled to compensation from the tenant if the tenant remains
in the rental unit after the seven day period has expired.
 
7.     In this case, the Tenant’s
seven day rent free period ran from February 25, 2020 to March
3, 2020.
 
8.    
Arguably, a landlord’s right to
seek an eviction of a superintendent from a superintendent unit suggests
that the Act should be interpreted in a manner
that would provide
a landlord with the means to
obtain compensation for the superintendent’s use of the unit beyond the date
the tenancy is terminated. I note that there is no provision in the statute
that expressly prevents the Board from awarding compensation. The Board’s
general authority to award daily compensation to a landlord if a tenant fails
to vacate a rental unit after a tenancy
has been terminated as outlined in section 86 of the Act. A logical reading of this section is that it permits the Board to award
daily compensation whenever a tenancy is being terminated.
 
9.    
Consequently, the Tenants owe the Landlord
daily compensation for the use of the unit
from March 4, 2020 to May 6, 2020.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of
May 6, 2020, the date the Tenants
gave vacant possession of the
rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $2,265.90, which
represents compensation for the
use of the unit from March 4, 2020 to May 6, 2020.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00
for the cost of filing the application.




 
4.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before January 31, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February
1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
