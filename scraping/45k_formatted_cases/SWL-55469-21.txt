Waseem Ghozayel
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Jason Campagna (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 20, 2022. Only the Landlord attended the hearing. As of 10:20
a.m., the Tenant
was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October
3, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
October 24, 2021. The Tenant
was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was
filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,400.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,400.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from March 1, 2021 to October 3, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of October
24, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.




File Number: SWL-55469-21
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,103.89*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to October
24, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
8, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 9, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
