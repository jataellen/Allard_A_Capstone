Tenants



 
 
 
333 Brock Street Peterborough Inc
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Laura
Mallory and Ed Mallory (the 'Tenants') of a superintendent's premises, because
the Tenant's employment as superintendent has ended; and because they, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone
they permitted in the residential complex have substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in
Passcode: 956 0593 7653# on January 18, 2022.
The Landlord’s representatives Allistar Tretn
and Glenice Campbell, and the Tenant,
Ed Mallory, represented by Colin Elsby, attended the hearing.
 
The Tenant requested an
adjournment. The Tenant submits that Laura Mallory would be having dental surgery at 2:30pm on
the day of the hearing and that Ed Mallory had back surgery in December. Mr. Mallory was in attendance by video. Considering the fact that this application
was filed in June 2021, seven months prior to this hearing, that the
allegations are both serious and relate employment that was terminated on May 18, 2021, which requires a superintendent to vacate the unit within seven days, and
the fact that it has been eight months since that time, the adjournment request
was denied. Mr. Mallory was in
attendance and was reasonably able to participate.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord terminated the employment of the Tenants
on May 18, 2021. The Tenants
have not vacated the superintendent's premises and more than one week has
passed since their employment was terminated.
 
2.     The Tenants’ representative submits that Laura Mallory was a tenant
before Ed Mallory became the superintendent.




 
 
 
3.     The Tenants’ representative points to two Board
decisions to show that the tenancy should continue after the
employment ends. The first is TSL-78694-16. In this case, the tenant was offered a reduced rent to provide
some services in and around the residential complex. The tenant in that case never occupied
a superintendent’s unit. I find the facts in that case are not the same as the
situation here. Ed Mallory was the
superintendent, occupied the superintendent’s unit, did not pay rent, and the last month rent deposit was returned when the employment commenced.
 
4.     The Tenants’ representative also points to TEL-51603-14. In that case the was a finding that there was an agreement that
when the employment ended the tenancy would continue. There was not such agreement in this case.
 
5.     The Tenants’ representative also points to the fact the Tenants
paid the Landlord
to stay in the unit after the
employment ended and that the Landlord served an N1 notice to increase the
rent.
 
6.    
The Landlord’s representative
submits that the Landlord accepted the money because the Tenant continued to occupy the unit and that if the Board determined that the tenancy should not be terminated serving
the notice was appropriate under the circumstances.
 
7.     Section 202 of the Residential Tenancies Act requires
the Landlord to look behind the outward appearance of a transaction. I find the money paid to the Landlord
after the tenancy was terminated due to the termination of employment does not
establish a new tenancy. A landlord
has to the right to be compensated when a tenant
remains in a rental
unit after notice is served. In this
case the notice to terminate the employment is also a notice to terminate the
tenancy.
 
8.    
Mr. Mallory was hired to be superintendent and occupied the superintendent’s unit. No
rent was paid to occupy the unit during his employment. The employment was terminated and as such the tenancy was
terminated under section 93 of the Act.
 
9.     In consideration of relief from eviction, the Landlord
submits that a new superintendent was hire on June 28, 2021, and because the
Tenants have not vacated the unit, he cannot occupy the superintendent’s unit
and has been living is a bachelor unit since his employment began. I also note the Tenants were to vacate
the rental unit May 31, 2021
based on the termination letter sent to the Tenants,
which exceeds that 7 days to vacate the unit under section 93 of the
Act.
 
10.  The Tenant have requested, that should the Board find the tenancy
should be terminated, that the termination be
delayed for four months. The
Landlord’s representatives agreed to a delay until March 31, 2022.
 
11.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until March 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.




 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated, as of March 31, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the
rental unit on or before March 31, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlord $7,973.40, which represents compensation for the use of the
unit from July 17, 2021 to January 26, 2022.
Any amounts the Tenants have paid are to the Landlord since July 17,
2021, shall applied to this amount ordered.
 
3.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$41.10 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from January 27, 2022 to
the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February 6, 2022, they will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 7, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before March 31, 2022, then starting April 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after April 1, 2022.
