A.N. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict A.C.B. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did
not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. (L1 application)
 
A.N. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict A.C.B. (the 'Tenant') The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination
date. (L2 applicatio)
 
This application was heard in Whitby on June 25, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord and the
Landlord’s representative, N.D., attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 application
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from May 1, 2018 to
June 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective May 22, 2018.
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,300.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from February 25, 2018 to May 22, 2018.
4.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
L2
application
 
5.     
The Landlord served the
Tenant with a notice of termination (N7) on May 9, 2018 with a termination date
of May 23, 2018. The particulars of the notice indicate that beginning in April
2018 the Tenant made loud noises during the night which disrupted the Landlord
and other tenant.
6.     
The Landlord alleges that
the Tenant is also smoking marijuana in the rental unit which is entering the
venting system and causing medical distress to the Landlord. A prescription for
an inhaler was provided as evidence of the medical condition of the Landlord. In
addition, the Tenant has a dog which is in violation of the lease agreement.
The Landlord is highly allergic to pets.
7.     
The Landlord provided a copy
of the lease agreement where it is set out that there is to be no loud noise,
no smoking in the unit and no pets.
8.     
The Landlord’s uncontested
evidence is that he spoke to the Tenant on several occasions about the conduct
however the Tenant was non-compliant.
9.     
The Landlord also provided
photographs of garbage strewn around the rental property by the Tenant. He has
been unable to get the Tenant to clean up his mess.
10.   I find that the Tenant has substantially
interfered with the Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment of the property and with
the lawful rights, privileges, or interests of the Landlords.
11.   I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated, as of July 31, 2018. The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before July 31, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $2,113.61*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to July 19, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $42.74 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
August 1, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before July 31, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from August 1,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before July 31, 2018, then starting August 1, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after August 1, 2018.
