Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19615-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1864 SECRETARIAT PLACE OSHAWA ON L1L1C7


 




Between:


Emily Frac


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Alex Sairoglou
  Kevin Alohan Nick Russell Tyrese Hoyte


Tenants



 
 
Emily Frac (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tyrese Hoyte,
Nick Russell, Alex Sairoglou and Kevin Alohan (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on January 5, 2022. The Landlord's Representative,
Eileen Frac, attended
the hearing. The Tenant, Kevin Alohan, attended
the hearing on behalf of all Tenants.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from August
1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective September 18, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
were in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $2,350.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $2,350.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
The Tenants
paid $7,250.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it
would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until January 31 2022
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants
must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 31, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$2,679.14*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 17, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $77.26 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 18, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing*
on or before January 31, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 1,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022, then starting February
1, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 1, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 31, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $6,226.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants
may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
 
 
January 17, 2022                                                                                 Date Issued                                                                       Richard Ferriss
