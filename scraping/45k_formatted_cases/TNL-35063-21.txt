and


 




 


Marleen A. Girley


Tenant



 
 
Schickedanz Bros. Properties (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Marleen A. Girley (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
24, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, David Ciobotaru, attended the hearing. As of 10:07 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
29, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,381.36.
 
4.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,381.36 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
has been paid to the Tenant for the period
from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020.
 
6.    
The Tenant
paid all arrears
for the period
ending January 31, 2022 after the application was
filed.
 
7.    
The only amount outstanding is the Landlord's cost of filing
the application. As a result, the order will be limited to
costs only and not eviction.
