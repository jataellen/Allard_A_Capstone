Order under Section
126
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
 
 
 
 
BR (the 'Landlord') applied for an order permitting the rent charged to be increased by more than the guideline for one or more of the rental
units in the residential
complex.
 
This application was resolved by written hearing.
No submissions were received from the
Tenants.
 
It is determined that:
 
1.                 
The Landlord
justified a rent increase above
the guideline because
of capital expenditures.
 
2.                 
The maximum
rent increase above the guideline
because of capital
expenditure is 1.71%. This increase is for the capital
expenditure for Roof Replacement.
 
3.                 
The Landlord
submits that a visual inspection was performed by DE
on October 3, 2017 and it was determined that the canopy
and main roofing
system was over 19 years old. The Landlord submits
that the waterproofing membrane had become detached in many areas, allowing for
water to leak into the building and DE recommended replacement of the canopy
and the main roof in 2018.
 
4.                 
The Landlord is
claiming costs for the roof replacement completed on November 26, 2018. The
Landlord submits the claimed costs are eligible under s.126(7)(a) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
“Act”) because the work was necessary to protect
and restore the physical integrity of the residential complex.
Conclusion
 
5.                 
I find the claimed
capital expenditure is an eligible capital expenditure that satisfy the
requirements of s.126(7)(a) of Act. I find the Landlord
is entitled to the amounts
claimed for the entirety of the work claimed in the application.
 
6.                 
The weighted
useful life for the capital
expenditure is 15 years.




7.                 
The first effective date of the rent increase above the guideline is March 1, 2020.
8.                 
The Landlord
or the Tenants shall pay to the other any sum of money that is
owed as a result of this order within 30 days of the date of this order.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.                 
The Landlord
may increase the rents charged
by 1.71% for the units
set out in Schedule
1.
 
2.                 
The percentage increase set out in paragraph 1 is to be taken within the time period
of March 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021.
 
3.                 
The percentage increase set out in paragraph 1 may be taken in addition to the annual guideline in effect on the increase
date for the unit.
 
4.                 
The Landlord
or the Tenants shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order within 30 days of
the date of this order.
 
5.                 
If the Tenant’s rent is
increased pursuant to the percentage increase ordered for capital expenditures and the same Tenant remains
in the unit after the expiration of the weighted useful life for capital expenditures, then the rent
will be reduced. Refer to Schedule 3 for information about the date and amount
of the rent reduction.
 
6.                 
The annual
guideline for 2020 is
2.2% and for 2021 is 0%.
