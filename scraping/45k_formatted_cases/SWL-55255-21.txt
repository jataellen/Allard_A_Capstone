In the matter
of:


214, 1090 HAMILTON ROAD LONDON ON N5W1A6


 




Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Michael Mcglade


Tenant



 
 
 
Italian
Seniors Project (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Michael Mcglade (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the
residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another
tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on January 24, 2022. The Landlord’s legal
agent,
K. Vos, legal representative, T. Schoenleber, and the Tenant’s
agents, N. Soares
and B. Campbell attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    For the reasons that follow, I find that the Tenant
another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the
residential complex has not substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another tenant. As such, the Landlord’s
application is dismissed.
 
2.   
The Landlord served a first N5 Notice on the Tenant
on August 14, 2021. The first N5 Notice
alleges that on July 23, 2021, the Tenant was smoking in his bathroom. The
residential complex is a non-smoking property. K. Vos testified that during an
annual inspection of the Tenant’s unit, the smell of cigarette smoke was
strong, and the bathroom fan was discoloured. The Tenant conceded to this
event.
 
3.    The Landlord served
a second N5 Notice on the Tenant
on September 22, 2021. The second
N5 Notice alleges that on September 9, 2021, the Tenant was smoking in the laundry
room.
K. Vos
testified that on this date, the Tenant was observed in the laundry room and
when he left, there was a lit cigarette
butt left on the floor. The Landlord
submitted into evidence
a surveillance video of the laundry room showing the Tenant with his
laundry cart, walking over to the washing machine, removing his clothing and
approaching the dryer, where something fell and rolled onto the floor.
A photograph of the cigarette
on the floor and black




 
marks beneath
it was submitted into evidence. The Landlord submitted this was scorch marks. The Tenant disputed
this occurred. The Tenant was wearing his mask while he was in the laundry room and therefore, was
not smoking.
 
Law and Analysis
 
4.   
Subsection 64 (1) of the Act states:
 
A landlord
may give a tenant notice
of termination of the tenancy
if the conduct of the tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the tenant is
such that it substantially interferes with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex for all usual purposes
by the landlord or another tenant or substantially interferes
with another lawful right, privilege or interest of the landlord or another
tenant. 2006, c. 17, s. 64 (1).
 
5.    It was uncontested that the Tenant was smoking in his
bathroom. I find that this act substantially interferes with the Landlord’s and
other tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex as this is a non-smoking property.
As such, I find that the first N5 notice is valid.
6.   
The Landlord served a second N5 Notice. Subsection 68(1) of the Act states that:
A landlord may give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy if,
(a)  
a
notice of termination was given to the tenant under section
62, 64 or 67; and
(b)   more than seven days but less than six months after
the notice mentioned in clause (a) was given to the tenant, an activity takes
place, conduct occurs or a situation arises that constitutes grounds for a
notice of termination under section 60, 61, 62, 64 or 67, other
than an activity, conduct or a situation
that is described in subsection 61 (1) and that involves
an illegal act, trade, business
or occupation described in
clause 61 (2) (a). 2006, c. 17, s. 68
(1); 2017, c. 13, s. 12.
 
7.    This section entitles
the Landlord to serve a non-voidable N5 if there is another
incident that occurs more than seven
days but less than six months after the Landlord
served the first N5
notice.
 
8.    I am not satisfied that the Tenant was smoking
in the laundry room. The surveillance footage shows the Tenant doing laundry.
At no point is the Tenant observed stopping to smoke a cigarette. While
the Landlord submits
that the cigarette was lit when it was found, the alleged
scorch marks appear to be ashes. While I find that the Tenant may have dropped
a previously lit cigarette, I do not find that the Tenant had smoked it in the
laundry room, or had it lit at the time he was there. As such, I find that the
Tenant did not engage in the behaviour described in the second N5 Notice and the Landlord cannot
terminate the tenancy on this basis. Therefore, the
Landlord’s application is dismissed.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.   
The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
