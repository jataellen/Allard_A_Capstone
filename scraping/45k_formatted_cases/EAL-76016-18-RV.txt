Review
Order
 
NHC (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict PM (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved by order
EAL-76016-18 issued on September 13, 2018.
 
On September 21, 2018, the Tenant requested
a review of the order.
 
The request was heard by teleconference on
October 12, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s
Representative SC and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Parties were asked to
provide post-hearing submissions by October 17, 2018; both parties did and
these were considered in arriving at this order.
 
 Determinations:
 
1.     
I am satisfied that the
Tenant could not reasonably participate in the original hearing; as a result,
the review hearing went ahead.
2.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent she was required to pay for the period from July 1, 2018 to October
31, 2018.  The Landlord Representative explained that because the Tenant failed
to provide requested information as regards her financial situation for the
annual income review on July 1, 2018, the Tenant’s income subsidy was revoked
and the rent for her rental unit went to market price as of July 1, 2018.
3.     
Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 2, 2018.
4.     
According to the Landlord
Representative, the Tenant owes $3,445.00, inclusive of costs, as of September
30, 2018. On October 31, 2018, that amount has risen to $4,530.00 according to
the ledger submitted by the Landlord in post-hearing submissions. The Tenant
has continued to pay her subsidized rent of $85.00; this is sent to the
Landlord directly by the Ontario Disability Support Program.
5.     
The Landlord Representative
submitted a number of letters that were sent to the Tenant as regards the
documents she should submit to secure her subsidy. The Tenant stated that she
had not received any of those. She also stated that she had suffered four strokes
and she has a hard time understanding things; this is why she has asked that
any correspondence be forwarded to her daughter. In reviewing the file, it
appears that in one instance, a request was made directly to the daughter, such
as when there was a need for a copy of the daughter’s passport. The daughter
replied and there was no issue. There is no other documented instance of the
Landlord communicating directly with the daughter as regards the documents
required from the Tenant to confirm ongoing eligibility for the subsidy.
6.     
The Tenant also testified
that she had completed the required documents and sent them in. I find that
correspondence in the file reveals that some documents were forwarded as
requested, but not all. I also find that it is clear that the Tenant is
confused; she maintains that the Ontario Disability Support Program has always
paid her rent.
7.     
In reviewing all of the
evidence before me, I find the following. The Tenant has been in the rental
unit since 2003. The Tenant is an obviously disabled person who needs help to
deal with correspondence. In the file, there are a number of confusing letters
that indicate that the rent will increase on many different dates. For example,
a N2 Notice was sent on March 23, 2018, stating that rent would increase to
market rent on July 1, 2018. Then another letter was sent on July 27, 2018,
stating that the increase to market rent would be on November 1, 2018. There
was a further letter on August 22, 2018, stating that rent would increase to
market rent on December 1, 2018. I find that for a Tenant who has had a number
of strokes and has to deal with many medical issues, this can certainly be most
confusing, if not incomprehensible. Other means of communication might be
advisable, such as in-person conversations; this might ensure that there are no
misunderstandings.
8.     
I find that as the Landlord
knows that this is a disabled Tenant, there is a duty to accommodate up to the
point of undue hardship under the Ontario Human Rights Code. I find that
in this case, the fact that the Tenant is in arrears of rent is directly
related to the Landlord’s lack of accommodation of the Tenant’s disabilities
that apparently prevent her from addressing rental issues. 
9.     
I find that I do not have
the jurisdiction to order the Landlord to reinstate the rental subsidy or to
extend the period for the Tenant to file the requested documents. All I can do
is to enjoin the Landlord to consider the Landlord’s obligations under the Code.

10.   I find that I can, however, given all the disclosed
circumstances, and in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), find that it would not be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. I also find that
I can order that the Tenant pay the rental arrears, although these are directly
related to a lack of accommodation under the Code.
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.     
Order EAL-76016-18 issued on
September 13, 2018 is cancelled and replaced by the following: The Tenant shall
pay to the Landlord $4,530.00, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to October 31, 2018.
 
2.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing on or before November 12, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from November
13, 2018 at 3.00 % annually on the balance outstanding.
