Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number:
TNL-34638-21
 



In the matter
of:


702, 1286 WILSON AVENUE TORONTO ON M3M3G4


 




Between:


Toronto Community Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kwame
Addo


Tenant



 
 
Toronto
Community Housing Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kwame
Addo (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on
December 13, 2021. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Rahel Abera, attended the
hearing. As of 2:14 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not
paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period from December 1, 2019 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective September 28, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $938.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.    
The Tenant
has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
6.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the parties and whether
the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 4, 2022.




File Number: TNL-34638-21
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$14,737.79*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 4, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $30.84
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 5, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
4, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 5, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 4, 2022, then starting January
5, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 5, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 4, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $15,728.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain
in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
5, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
