Tenant



 
 
 
Laurent Gauthier and 13383024
Ontario Inc. (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Lisa Dixon (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on
October 5, 2021 with respect to application EAL- 92876-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Board issued an order on consent pertaining to
file number EAL-92876-20 on October 5, 2021 which required
the Tenant to control the behaviour of her pet dog.
 
2.     The agreement provided that the Landlord could apply
to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain conditions specified in the
order.
 
3.    
Pursuant to subsection 78(5)
of the Act, an application made under section
78 must be filed no later than 30 days after the
breach of the order.
 
4.     Within the subject
L4 application the Landlord claims
that the Tenant had not met the following condition as set out in the
order:
 
•        
The Tenant
shall have the dog on a leash
and have the dog muzzled
everywhere on the residential complex with exception to the rental unit.
 
5.     The Landlord’s application was filed with the Board
on January 18, 2022, which,
pursuant to ss. 78 (5) of the Act, is more than 30 days after the Tenant
failed to meet a condition set out in the order of EAL-92876-20 dated on
October 5, 2021. The most recent alleged breach would have been in relation to
the event of November 24, 2021.




File Number: EAL-99215-22
 
 
 
6.     The Board does not have jurisdiction to consider this application as it was filed beyond the statutory 30-day period after
the alleged breach had taken place.
 
 
7.     As the Landlord’s application does not meet the statutory requirements under subsections 78(5) of the Act, the application is
dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application under section 78 of the Act is dismissed.
