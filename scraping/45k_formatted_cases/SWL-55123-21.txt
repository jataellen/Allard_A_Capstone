  matter of:

and


 




 


Michael Allard Stephanie Fink


Tenants



 
 
 
Michael Kopcok (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Stephanie Fink and Michael Allard
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 13, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Tim Currie, attended
the hearing. As of 1:51 p.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective September 15, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on October
31, 2021. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,300.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of October
31, 2021, the date the Tenants gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.




File Number: SWL-55123-21
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $5,207.14*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to October 31, 2021.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or
before February 1, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 2,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
