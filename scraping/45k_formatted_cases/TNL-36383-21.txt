Residential Tenancies Act,

File Number: TNL-36383-21




 
In the matter
  of:


 
207,
  795 DAVIS DRIVE NEWMARKET ON L3Y2R6


 




Between:


2777578 Ontario
Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Katie Shedden


Tenant



 
 
 
On December 7, 2021, 2777578 Ontario
Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Katie Shedden (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant entered
into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Landlord and the Tenant signed
an agreement to terminate the tenancy as of
December 31, 2021.
 
2.       
Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date,
it is not appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application
filing fee as costs.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 21, 2022.
 
2.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 21, 2022, then starting January
22, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.




File Number: TNL-36383-21
 
 
 
3.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 22, 2022.
 
 
 
4.       
The tenant has until January
20, 2022 to file a motion with the
Board to set aside the order under s. 77(6)
of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January
20, 2022 the order will be
stayed, and the Board will schedule a hearing.
 
 
5.       
In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on July 22,
2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
