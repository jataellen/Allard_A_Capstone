Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-97397-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1367 WAVERLEY CRESCENT KINGSTON ON K7M6J8


 




Between:


Kemar Trenchfield
Tribond Property Management Inc.


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Carl Jarvis Jeannie Foxton


Tenants



 
 
 
and Kemar Trenchfield and Tribond Property Management Inc. (the
'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Carl Jarvis and Jeannie Foxton (the 'Tenants') because:
(a)  
the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe (the “L1 Application”); and,
(b)  
they, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone
they permitted in the residential complex have substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlords or another tenant (the “L2 Application”).
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021.
 
Only the
Landlord, Kemar Trehchfield, the Landlord’s property manager, Dan Farah, and
the Landlord’s legal representative, Greg Foss, attended the hearing. As of 10:06 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
The L1
Application
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were
required to pay for the period from February 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlords
served a Notice of Termination effective July 22, 2021. The Tenants were in possession of the rental unit when the
Notice of Termination was served.
 
2.    
The Tenants
vacated the rental
unit on November 24, 2021.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent was
$2,100.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant
has made no payments since the application was filed.




File Number: EAL-97397-21
 
 
 
5.    
The Landlords collected a rent deposit of $2,100.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from August
21, 2019 to July 22, 2021.
 
The L2
Application
 
7.    
As the only remedy
sought in the L2 Application was the termination of the tenancy,
that application is moot given that the Tenants have vacated the rental
unit.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of November
24, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant possession of the rental unit
to the Landlord.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlords $16,400.61*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to November 24, 2021,
less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlords $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before
January 22, 2022, the Tenants will
start to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from January 23, 2022, at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
