Landlords




 


and


 




 


Kathleen Brauer


Tenant



 
Pine Allard
Properties and Carrie Seabrook (the
'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kathleen
Brauer (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on February 3, 2022. Only the Landlord, Carrie Seabrook, attended the hearing.
As of 2:43 p.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from October 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of
Termination effective October 30, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on November
30, 2021. The Tenant was in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $750.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,020.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period from September 5, 2020 to October 30,
2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of November 30, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlords.




File Number: NOL-44385-21
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlords $1,024.28*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to November
30, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing* on or before February 22, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 23,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
