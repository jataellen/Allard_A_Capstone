  of:


 
2, 349
SANDYS STREET CHATHAM ON
  N7L3X8


 




Between:


Grace Labuda


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Paige Jones


Tenant



 
 
 
Grace Labuda (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Paige Jones (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes, and because the Tenant,
another occupant of the rental
unit or someone
the Tenant permitted
in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or
another tenant.
 
This application was heard
by video conference on June 7, 2021.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant attended
the hearing. The Tenant
spoke with Duty Counsel prior to
the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Tenant has paid the total rent
the Tenant was required to pay for the period from April 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. The Tenant owes the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the applications.
 
2.       
The Landlord and the Tenant agreed
to resolve the issue of the filing fee between
them.
 
3.       
The Landlord claims that on August
6, 2020, upon entry into the Tenant’s
rental unit for an inspection, the Landlord observed
that the unit was unkempt and that there was an accumulation of spilled liquids
within the unit.
 
4.       
On August 27, 2020 the Tenant
refused to permit the Landlord’s agent entry into the rental unit for the purpose of performing pest control treatment. The Landlord states
that the Tenant’s unit was unprepared for the technician.
 
5.       
The Tenant claims that the Landlord
has failed to control the pest infestation in the unit. She
denies that she has not prepared the unit for the technicians. She testified that she




File Number: SWL-45671-20
 
has complied with numerous
entries by the Landlord or the Landlord’s agent, except for May 13, 2020 and July 19, 2020 when she was concerned about
Covid-19 restrictions. She stated that she has allowed the Landlord entry into
the unit since then.
 
6.       
The Tenant is a single mother
with two small
children. Her current
source of income
as of the hearing date was
Employment Insurance.
 
7.       
While there are discrepancies in
some of the evidence, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the Landlord
has established that the Tenant’s
conduct has substantially interfered with Landlord’s
and other tenants reasonable enjoyment of the residential premises, and with
the rights of the Landlord.
 
8.       
I
have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including the unopposed evidence of the Tenant and the time that has already passed
since the hearing,
I find that it would not
be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in
this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. These
conditions should not be onerous on the Tenant and they are minimally
prejudicial to the Landlord, if at all.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
For a period of 9 months,
from January 1, 2022 until
August 31, 2022, the Tenant shall
maintain the rental unit in a reasonable state of ordinary cleanliness and
ensure that there is a clear path of egress at all times throughout the unit.
 
2.       
Commencing on January 1, 2022, and
once per month thereafter for a period of 9 months, from January 1, 2022 until August 31, 2022, the Tenant shall permit the Landlord
entry into the rental unit, after being provided with the proper written Notice
of Entry.
 
3.       
If the Tenant does not comply with
paragraphs 1 and 2, above, the Landlord may file an application under s.78 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 for a termination of the tenancy and eviction of the Tenant,
without notice to the Tenant,
and shall do so within
30 days of the breach of any of the conditions.
