Tenants



 
 
 
Tiffany Black and Cameron
Black (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Craig Gowland and Ryan Woods (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord
requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation. The Landlords also claimed compensation for each
day the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on October 13, 2021.
 
The Landlords and the Tenants attended
the hearing. The Tenants spoke with duty counsel.
The Landlords’ witness and proposed occupant, William Black, also attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     Based on the evidence before me, I find that the
Landlords in good faith require possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation for their parent, William Black.
 
2.     On August 2, 2021 the Landlords gave the Tenant’s
an N12 notice of termination for landlord’s own use. The
termination date on the N12 notice is October 31, 2021.
 
3.     The Landlords paid the Tenants
compensation equal to one month's
rent on October
13, 2021 during the hearing.
 
4.     The Landlord met the requirements under section
72(1)(a) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the ‘Act’)
by filing with the Board
an affidavit sworn
by William Black, in which
Mr. Black certifies that he in good faith requires the rental unit for his own
personal use for a period of at least one year. Mr. Black also testified at the
hearing and was cross examined by the Tenants regarding his good faith
intention of occupying the rental unit for a period of at least one year.




 
5.    
The Landlord also testified that
his father is living in poor conditions, and the wartime cottage he is living
in would likely
be torn down by the end of November 2021 because it is full of mold and regularly floods. Mr. Black further testified that he needs
to move because of the poor air quality in his house.
 
6.     The Tenants’ position
is that they believe the Landlord served the N12 notice in bad faith because they told the Tenants that
their cousin would be moving into the unit and then became confrontational when
the Tenants told the Landlord that they would not be moving out of the rental
unit for this reason.
 
Analysis
 
7.    
The courts have provided
much guidance to the Board
in interpreting the “good faith” requirement in the context of a
landlord seeking possession of a rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation by the landlord.
 
8.    
In Feeny
v. Noble, 1994 CanLII 10538 (ON SC), 19 O.R. (3d) 762, the Ontario
Divisional Court considered this issue in the context of subsection
103(1) under the Landlord and Tenant Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.7, and held that:
 
“…the test of good faith is a genuine
intention to occupy
the premises and not the reasonableness of the landlord’s
proposal”.
 
9.    
In Salter
v. Beljinac, 2001 CanLII
40231 (ON SCDC)
the Divisional Court
stated at paras 18, 26-27:
 
In my view, s.51(1) [now RTA
s.48(1)] charges the finder of fact with the task of determining whether the
landlord's professed intent to want to reclaim the unit for a family member is
genuine, that is, the notice to terminate the tenancy is made in good faith.
The alternative finding
of fact would be that the landlord
does not have a
genuine intent to reclaim the unit for the purpose of residential occupation by
a family member.
 
While it is relevant to the
good faith of the landlord's stated intention to determine the likelihood that the intended
family member will move into the unit, the Tribunal stops short of entering into an
analysis of the landlord's various options.
 
Once the landlord is acting in
good faith, then necessarily from the landlord's subjective perspective the
landlord requires the unit for the purpose of residential occupation by a family
member. That is sufficient to meet the s.51(1) standard.
The fact that the landlord might choose the particular unit to occupy
for economic reasons does not result in failing to meet the s.51(1) standard.
 
10.  More recently, in Fava v. Harrison, 2014 ONSC 3352 (CanLII) the Divisional Court,
in considering this issue in the context of the Act, found as follows:




 
We accept, as reflected in
Salter, supra, that the motives of the landlord in seeking possession of the
property are largely irrelevant and that the only issue is whether the landlord
has a genuine intent to reside in the property. However, that does not mean that the Board cannot
consider the conduct
and the motives
of the landlord in order to draw inferences as to whether
the landlord desires,
in good faith,
to occupy the property.
 
11.  The Tenants’ testified that they had a conversation
with the Landlord on July 22, 2021 regarding having the Landlords’ cousin and 3
children move into the rental unit. Shortly
thereafter the Tenants reached out to get advice and were told that the
Landlord cannot give notice to have their cousin move into the rental unit. The Tenants testified that they brought
this to the Landlords attention in a phone
conversation on or about
July 31, 2021 and in response the Landlord became abusive and swore at the
Tenants and asserted that the Tenants in fact would be moving out of the house. The Tenants further testified that the Landlord sent them a text right after the
phone call threatening to remove the
AC unit. Shortly thereafter, the Landlord served the N12 notice indicating his father would be
moving into the unit.
 
12.  The Landlords did not dispute
that they had a conversation with
the Tenants on or about July 22,
2021 regarding taking back the property for the use of his cousin and their
children. The Landlord testified that
it was also his intention all along to have his father move into the unit with his cousin for their mutual
support and to get his father into better
living conditions. The Landlord also
indicated that his cousin backed out of wanting to move into the unit shortly
after his conversation with the Tenants, but that his father still intended on
moving into the unit and that’s why he served the N12 notice for his father.
 
13.  The Landlord did not dispute that he told the Tenants
he would be removing the AC unit from the property, but wanted to clarify it was regarding
an old AC unit that was collecting dust in the back yard and not
the new AC unit.         The Landlord did not dispute the Tenants’ accusation that he became verbally abusive
on the phone during a conversation
with the Tenants on or about July 31, 2021 where he told the Tenants they would
be moving out of the unit.
 
14.  I do not doubt that a dispute between the Landlord and
the Tenants arose just shortly before the service of the N12 notice. However, I
find that the conversation between the Landlord and the Tenants
that the Landlords intended to take back the property for their
own use, was prior to the dispute.
 
15.  I see no reason to doubt the oral testimony of the
Landlord or the Landlords’ father, William Black and therefore I find, on a
balance of probabilities, that William Black does have a genuine intent to occupy
the rental unit in good faith for a period of more than one year.
 
16.  The Tenants requested that if termination is granted,
that they be allowed three or more months to find alternative accommodations because they have mobility issues that make it more difficult to find
accommodations.




 
17.  The Tenants concerns were regarding having to move
when suffering financial hardship and suffering from physical and mental health
issues. The Tenants indicated that they
had hoped to stay in the rental unit for a longer period of time in order to
catch up financially and to gain stability
with their housing.
The Tenants further
indicated that they have lived in the area for about
three years.
 
18.  The Landlord requested
an order that the Tenant’s
move out by no later than November 30, 2021 because the Landlords’
father would no longer have a house to live in.
 
19.  I
am mindful that this hearing took place on October 13, 2021 and that the Tenants have had the benefit of the time it has
taken for the order to be issued. I
am also mindful that the Landlords’
father may no longer have their own home to reside in.
 
20.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until February 15, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated, as of February
28, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $5,654.50, which represents compensation for the
use of the unit from November 1, 2021 to January 25, 2022. The Landlords shall
deduct any amount paid by the Tenant that relates to this time period.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $65.75 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from January 26, 2022 to
the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing on or before February
28, 2022, they will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from March 1,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after March 1, 2022.
