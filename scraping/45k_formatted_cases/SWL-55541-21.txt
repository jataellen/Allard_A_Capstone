Rudy Leenaerts (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Laura Beaulieu (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 20, 2022. Only the Landlord
attended the hearing. As of 11:30 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from August 24, 2021 to November 1, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 2, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on November
1, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful weekly rent was
$225.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $225.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     The Tenant paid $430.00 after the application was filed.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenancy is terminated as of November
1, 2021. This is the date that the Tenant vacated the rental unit.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$1,165.00*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to November 1, 2021, less the rent deposit.




File Number: SWL-55541-21
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 20, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 21, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
