Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44421-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1307 BEATTIE STREET NORTH BAY
ON P1B3T2


 




Between:


7333455 Canada
Inc (Kiefer Min Fai Li)


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Aaron Laplante
Amy Raymond Deanna
Winters


Tenants



 
 
 
7333455 Canada Inc (Kiefer Min
Fai Li) (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Aaron
Laplante, Amy Raymond
and Deanna Winters
(the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent
that the Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard by videoconference
on February 3, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Daria berezowska,
attended the hearing. As of 3:15 p.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from March 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination effective November 9, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,470.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants paid $3,100.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 22, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$2,887.98*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 11, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $48.33
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 12,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the
Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 22, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 23, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 22, 2022, then starting
February 23, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord, on or after February 23, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 22, 2022, the Tenants pay
the amount of $3,976.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be
void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 23, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
                                                                                                                             
February 11, 2022
