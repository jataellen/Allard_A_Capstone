And

Tenants



 
 
 
RWC Management (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Penny Foltz and Christopher Black (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
13, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Ibifiri Fabian, attended the hearing. As of 3:11 p.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective September 16, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on October
31, 2021. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,850.00.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,850.00
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated effective
October 31, 2021,
the day the Tenants returned vacant possession to the
Landlord.




File Number: NOL-44157-21
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $619.00*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to October 31, 2021, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or
before February 4, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 5,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
