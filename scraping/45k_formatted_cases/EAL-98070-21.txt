Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-98070-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


2, 43 MAIN
STREET WEST SMITH FALLS
ON K7A1M7


 




Between:


Trevor Strickland
  Brian Comeau


Landlords




 


and


 




 


Nicole Tye


Tenant



 
 
Trevor Strickland and Brian
Comeau (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Nicole Tye (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the
Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on August 10, 2021 with respect
to application EAL-95865-21.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 6, 2021.
 
Only the Landlords attended
the hearing. The Tenant was not present
or represented despite being served with the notice of
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlords could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant
did not meet conditions specified in the order in the following ways:
 
a)   
The Tenant was required to pay
$1,000.00 towards arrears of rent on September
15, 2021 and the Tenant
did not pay anything towards
the arrears on September 15,
2021.
 
b)   
The Tenant was required to pay
$200.00 on the 15th day of every month for a period of 11 month’s
commencing October 15, 2021 and continuing through
to the period ending August 31, 2022, with a final payment of $186.00 on
September 15, 2022. The Tenant did
not pay $200.00 on October 15 or November 15.
 
c)   
The Tenant was required
to pay the lawful monthly
rent as it became due on the first of each month during the
repayment period for the arrears starting




 
September 2021 through to
September 2022. The Tenant did not
pay the September 2021 rent until September
2, 2021. The Tenant has not paid the
October, November or December 2021 rent at all.
 
3.     The
L4 application was filed with the Board
on October 5, 2021, within
30 days of the
breaches of September rent being paid
late; the September 15th arrears payment
not made and the October 2021 rent not being paid as described above.
 
4.     The Landlord testified
that The Tenant
has made no payments at all towards
the arrears of rent and has
only paid the September rent, albeit a day late.
 
5.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the
Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlords are entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
daily compensation.
 
6.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $3,386.00, consisting of costs
($189.00) plus rent arrears
($3,200.00) in Order EAL-95865-21. The amount that is still owing from that
order is
$3,386.00 and that amount is included
in this order.
As a result, the previous
order EAL- 95865-21 is
cancelled.
 
7.    
Since the date of the order,
the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from October 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.
 
8.     The monthly rent is $800.00
and the Landlords testified that there is no last month’s rent on deposit.
 
9.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order EAL-95865-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 29, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords
$5,786.00*. This amount
represents the rent and
the $186 filing fee cost owing up to December 31, 2021.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords
$26.30 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 1, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount
owing* on or before January
29, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 30, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.




 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 29, 2022, then starting January
30, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after January 30, 2022.
