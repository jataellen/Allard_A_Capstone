In the matter
of:


C, 224 HUNTINGDON CRESCENT WATERLOO ON N2L4P9


 




Between:


Dolce Deodato


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Brian Loney


Tenant



 
 
Dolce Deodato (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy of Brian Loney (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant has abandoned the unit.
 
This application was heard by video conference on November 1, 2021.
 
At 12:40
pm, the Landlord and the Landlord’s Witness
T. Bach attended
the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
The rental
unit is a basement bachelor
apartment in a single-family home. The residential complex contains 3 rental
units in total.
 
2.   
The tenancy
started in approximately 2013.
 
3.   
The Landlord
who lives in the rental
complex has not seen the Tenant in the past 5
months.
 
4.   
According to s.2(3) of the Residential Tenancies Act (the ‘Act’):
 
For
the purposes of this Act, a
tenant has not abandoned a rental
unit if the tenant is not in arrears of rent.
 
5.   
The Landlord
testified that the Tenant had paid rent by leaving
the cheque in the mailbox at the rental unit and would
provide a few monthly payments at a time.
 
6.   
The Landlord
claims that the Tenant has not paid rent from June 2021 to the date of the
hearing.




File Number: SWL-53623-21
 
7.   
When the June
2021 rent was not paid, the Landlord
attempted to contact
the Tenant by phone, text messages, email and
knocking on the door with no response.
 
8.   
The Landlord entered
the rental unit on multiple occasions and noted that the unit contained furniture, a bed, work desk and some clothes
in the closet. The fridge was
mostly empty and the bathroom had minimal possessions.
9.   
The Landlord
noted that the condition of the Tenant’s
unit remained unchanged between each inspection.
 
10.
The Landlord
said that the Tenant had lived a very quiet life and during his tenancy, the Landlord was not aware of any friends
nor family.
 
11.
Additionally, other Tenants in the residential complex had not seen the Tenant since
May 2021.
 
12.
Based
on the uncontested testimony of the
Landlord, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Tenant
has abandoned the unit.
 
13. The Landlord made reasonable efforts to
contact the Tenant over the last 5 months and at various times of day. All of the cumulative evidence,
including the communication efforts and the untouched state of the Tenant’s
possessions supports that the Tenant has left the rental complex. All of this supports
the Landlord’s position
that the Tenant
has left the unit.
 
14.
This order contains all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The tenancy
between the Landlord and Tenant is terminated. The Tenant has abandoned the rental unit.
