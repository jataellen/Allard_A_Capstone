Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26868-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


44 EASTCHESTER AVE.
ST. CATHARINES ON L2P2Y4


 




Between:


Robin Bowman
  Mark Bowman


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Martin Bridgman


Tenant



 
 
 
Robin Bowman and Mark Bowman (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Martin Bridgman (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant entered into an
agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlords and the Tenant signed an agreement to terminate the tenancy as of April 30, 2022.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before April 30, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated on or before
April 30, 2022, then starting May 1, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.
