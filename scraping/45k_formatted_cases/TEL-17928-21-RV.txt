Alex Beatty and Ashley Carmichael Beatty (the 'Tenants') to pay
the rent that they owe.
 
This application was resolved
by order TEL-17928-21 issued on October
20, 2021.
 
On October 21, 2021, the Landlord
requested a review of the order alleging the were not reasonably able to participate in the hearing
because they never
received the Notice
of Hearing.
 
The request was heard by way of video conference on January 11,
2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Crystal
Do Couto attended
the hearing. As of 9:26 am, the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served notice of the hearing by the Board.
