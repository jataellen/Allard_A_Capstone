Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-04593-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


7335 SIGSBEE DRIVE MISSISSAUGA ON L4T3S5


 




Between:


Sukhvinder Kaur Gill


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Sharon Pearson


Tenant



 
 
 
Sukhvinder Kaur Gill (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sharon Pearson
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant entered
into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord and the Tenant signed an agreement to terminate the tenancy as of March 31, 2022.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before March 31, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 31, 2022, then starting
April 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after April 1, 2022.
