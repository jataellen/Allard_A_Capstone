Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-23877-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


429 PARKSIDE DRIVE TORONTO ON M6R2Z7


 




Between:


Laurie Brown Elizabeth Kapusta


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Elana Safronsky


Tenant



 
 
 
Laurie Brown and Elizabeth
Kapusta (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Elana Safronsky (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant or another occupant
of the rental unit has committed
an illegal act or has carried out, or permitted someone to carry out an illegal
trade, business or occupation in the rental unit or the residential complex
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on February
15, 2022. The Landlord,
represented by George Brown, and the Tenant, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The residential complex has four separate
units. The Landlord
resides in one of the units.
 
2.    
The Tenant is a single mother.
Her ex-husband is what the Tenant described as a handy man and assisted her in creating
room in the basement for their child. To
do this, he installed drywall as well as the materials necessary for this job. While the work was taking place, he removed the smoke detector in the basement. The Landlord discovered the smoke detector was missing. According to the Tenant, the work took
approximately one week. When she
received the notice the smoke detector was missing it was reinstalled. The Tenant was unaware the smoke detector
was taken down.
 
3.     There are a total of eight smoke
detectors in the residential complex.
 
4.    
I
find the Tenant
did not intentionally commit an illegal act and under the circumstances the tenancy should not be
terminated.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of the application.




File Number: TSL-23877-21
 
 
 
2.     The Landlord has the right
to collect the full amount
at any time.
 
3.     The balance of the Landlords' application is dismissed.
