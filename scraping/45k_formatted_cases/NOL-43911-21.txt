Don Lapointe Sandra Hunt


Tenants




 
 
 
6945601 Canada Inc (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Don Lapointe and Sandra Hunt (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay
the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 13, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s Agents, Marlene
and David Rodie,
and the Tenant, Don Lapointe
(‘DL’), attended the hearing.
The Tenant was assisted by Duty Counsel at the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from February 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective September 11, 2021.
 
2.    
DL is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $2,450.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants have made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
Section 83
 
6.     DL proposed a payment plan to pay
$1,225.00, commencing February 20, 2022 and on the 20th of every month thereafter until the arrears are paid. In
addition, DL proposed to pay the monthly rent on time during the period of the
repayment. I denied DL’s proposal because there was insufficient evidence
to satisfy me that DL’s proposal was reasonable




File Number: NOL-43911-21
 
in the circumstances. DL is unemployed and has not made any payments since the
application was filed.
 
7.     However, given the state of the rental
market and the difficulties in finding a place, I find
that it would not be unfair to grant a short postponement in order to allow DL
to make alternate arrangements.
 
8.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 15,
2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 15, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$14,213.08*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 20, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $80.55
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 21, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
15, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 16, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 15, 2022, then starting
February 16, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 16, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenants
wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$15,211.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$17,661.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 15, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not make full
payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline,
then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after




File Number: NOL-43911-21
 
February 16, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during
the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
