Starlight Canadian Residential Growth Fund (the 'Landlord') applied

evict Janet Daniel and Alexandra
Daniel (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 14, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Sara Matthew,
attended the hearing.
As of 1:55 p.m. the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from August
1, 2021 to October 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August
29, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
vacated the rental
unit on October 31, 2021. The Tenants
were in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was
filed.

rent was $1,289.76.
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
5.

and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.     Interest
on the rent deposit has been paid to the Tenants up to December
31, 2020.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy is
terminated as of October 30, 2021, the date the Tenants gave vacant possession
of the rental unit to the Landlord.

The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
