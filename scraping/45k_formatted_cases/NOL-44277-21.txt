Northstar Property
Management (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Shamus Sweet and Sweet Dubosq (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 27, 2022. Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
As of 2:18 p.m., the Tenants were not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period
from October 1, 2021 to October
31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective October 20, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on January
15, 2022. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $850.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of January
15, 2022, the date the Tenants gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.




File Number: NOL-44277-21
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $2,990.55*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 15, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
15, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 16, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
