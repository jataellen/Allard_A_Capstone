In the matter of:      104, 165 OLD MUSKOKA ROAD
GRAVENHURST ON P1P1N3
 
Between:                  Centurion Property Associates Inc                                    Landlord
 
and
 
Cody Michael James Werney                                                                                                                  Tenant
 
On November 17, 2021, Centurion Property
Associates Inc (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Cody Michael James Werney (the 'Tenant') and for an order
to have the Tenant pay the rent he owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order
issued by the Board on November 2, 2021 with respect to application
CEL-01588-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant
if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following conditions specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed to pay to the Landlord
$500.0 on or before November
15, 2021 towards arrears of
rent.
 
3.       
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$3,195.94 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application
fee in Order CEL-01588-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $3,195.94
and that amount
is included in this
order. As a result, the previous
order CEL-01588-21 is cancelled.
 
5.       
Since the date of the order, the Tenant has also failed to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from
November 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.
 
6.       
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $750.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.       
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January
1, 2021 to January 10, 2022.




File Number: CEL-04244-21
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.       
Order CEL-01588-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 21, 2022.
 
3.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,490.69*. This amount represents the rent owing up to November 30, 2021 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$27.47 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting December 1, 2021 to
the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
21, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 21, 2022, then starting January
22, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after January 22, 2022.
 
 
 
January 10, 2022

The tenant has until January 20, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 20, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
