Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-00822-18



 


 


 



 
 
EGL
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict CG
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes
(‘L1 application’), and because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying
the Tenant’s rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date (‘L2 application’).
 
This
combined application was heard in Toronto on January 19, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord’s legal representative, BR attended the
hearing.  There
was no record before me of a request to adjourn and I was satisfied that the
parties had proper notice of the hearing.  After waiting more than 30 minutes,
I proceeded to determine the application on the basis of the materials before
me and submissions from the Landlord.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent she was required to pay for the period from
December 1, 2017 to January 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective December 22, 2017.
 
2.      This
is a monthly tenancy, and rent is due on the first day of each month.  The
evidence before me shows that the Tenant has not paid the full rent when due in
ten of the twelve months from January, 2017 to December, 2017.  I am satisfied
that the Tenant has been persistently late in the payment of rent.
3.      The
Tenant paid $1,400.00 after the application was filed.
4.      No
circumstances were disclosed to me to support relief from eviction in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, (2006) (the
‘Act’).
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
L1 application
 
1.     Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before February 2, 2018.  However, even if the Tenant voids the part of
this eviction order that relates to non-payment of rent, the tenancy will be
terminated as of February 28, 2018 for the Tenant’s persistent late payment of
rent.
2.     The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,359.11*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to January 22, 2018.
3.     The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $52.06 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting January 23, 2018 to the date he moves out of the unit.
4.     The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.     If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
February 2, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from February 3, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.     If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 2, 2018, then starting February
3, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 3,
2018.
8.     If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, she must pay to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)       $1,956.78 if the payment is made on or before January 31, 2018, or
ii)      $3,540.17 if the payment is made on or before February 2, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced. However,
the tenancy will still be terminated on February 28, 2018 because of the
Tenant’s persistent late payment of rent. 
9.     The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside the part of this eviction order for non-payment of rent if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 3, 2018 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.  However, the tenancy will still be terminated on
February 28, 2018 because of the Tenant’s persistent late payment of rent.
 
 
L2 application
 
10.   Even
if the Tenant voids the part of this eviction order for non-payment of rent,
the tenancy will still be terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before February 28, 2018.
  
11.   If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2018, then starting March 1,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
12.   Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 1, 2018.
