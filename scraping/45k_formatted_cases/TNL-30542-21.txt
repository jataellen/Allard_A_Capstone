Landlord




 


and


 




 


David Lance


Tenant



 
Howard Brice Jr (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict David Lance (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
A Case Management Hearing
(CMH) was held February 01, 2021, the parties were unable to resolve the issues in the applications
and the matters were directed to a full merit hearing
 
This application was heard via video/teleconference on October 14, 2021.
 
The Tenant, the Tenant's
Legal Representative Caryma Sa’d, the Landlord and the Landlord's Legal Representative Robert
Leck attended the hearing.
 
At the hearing the Tenant raised issues pursuant to section
82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') as set out in
related application TNT-29287-21.
 
Background and Determinations:
 
1.     The residential complex
comprises of 4 rental units.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Tenant and the former Landlord Howard
Bruce Sr commenced July 1, 2017. The Tenant
previously occupied a rental unit on the upper level and relocated to a lower
main floor unit in the fall of 2019.
 
3.     On August 27, 2020 the Landlord served
a N4 notice of termination because
the Tenant had not paid the
total rent that was required to be paid from April 1, 2020.
 
4.     At the hearing,
the Tenant asserted
that while he no longer
lived in the rental unit that he continues to have possession of the
unit.
 
5.     It was not disputed that the monthly
rent is/was $600.00.
 
6.     It was not disputed that Tenant has not paid anything towards
rent from April 1, 2020.




 
7.    
The Tenant purports that the former
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $600.00 from the
Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the current Landlord and that
interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 1,
2017.
 
8.     The Landlord application set out that the total amount
of the rent arrears owing to the Landlord up to January 31, 2021 totals
$6,000.00 and since
the filing of the application additional rent is owing from
February 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021 now totalling
$11,400.00 plus $186.00 for the cost of the Landlord’s application.
 
9.     The Tenant sought
issues pursuant to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 as outlined in the
Tenant’s T6 application TNT-29287-20 that was filed with the Board November 20,
2020 prior to the Landlords’ L1 application.
 
10.  Section 82(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 outlines the requirements that must
be met in order for a tenant to raise any issue that could be the subject of an
application made by the tenant under this Act:
 
11.  A Case Management Hearing (CMH) was held February
01, 2021 setting
out a merit hearing was to be
rescheduled so that the Tenant’s application and this Landlord application
would be heard together.
 
12.  I proceeded to hear the Tenant’s T6 application first
and followed by the Landlord’s L1 application for rent arrears.
 
13.  Order TNT-29287-20 was issued February
7, 2022 awarding the Tenant a monetary
rent abatement remedy for outstanding maintenance issues totaling
$7,250.00.
 
14.  Order TNT-29287-20 directed the Tenant - if the
Landlord does not pay the Tenant the full amount owing by February 15, 2022,
the Tenant may recover this amount by deducting either from the rent each month should he still occupy
the rental unit or deduct the amount owing from arrears of
rent that have not been paid under application TNL- 30542-21 issued subsequent
to this order.
 
15.  Subsection 37(1) of the
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the RTA) states “a tenancy may be terminated only in accordance with
the Act.”
 
16.  Section 43(1) of the Act sets
out the minimum requirements for a notice of termination of a tenancy such as the (N12) notice given here. It states -
where this Act permits a Landlord to give a notice of termination, the notice
shall be in a form approved by the Board and shall,
a)  identify the rental unit for
which the notice is given.
 
17.  The N4 notice
given to the Tenant
simply identifies the municipal address
of the property.
 
18.  The residential complex
comprises of 4 rental units.




 
19.  I was not satisfied the notice properly
identified the Tenant’s
specific rental unit for which the notice is given as required
pursuant to section 43 (1)(a) of the Act.
 
20.  A notice cannot be amended
after it is given
 
21.  A notice, particularly given to end the tenancy and
evict a Tenant must clearly differentiate the rental unit in a multi unit complex.
Given what is at stake—that is termination of a tenancy, the requirement that the unit be correctly identified, seeks to eliminate, or at least significantly
reduce, the possibility of confusion.
 
22.  The applicable statutory
notice provisions above are mandatory in nature and require strict compliance.
 
23.  Consequently the (N4) notice is defective and not valid.
Therefore, the Board
has no jurisdiction to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant based on an invalid notice.
 
24.  The Landlord’s L1 application is amended to an L9 application for arrears of rent only.
 
25.  The Tenant did not dispute
that he has not paid anything towards
rent from April 1, 2020.
 
26.  Based on the uncontested evidence, I am satisfied on a balance
of probabilities that as of the hearing date, that the Tenant owes
to the Landlord up to the period ending October 31, 2021, rent arrears of
$11,400.00, plus the Landlords’ application cost of $186.00, totalling
$11,586.00.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $3,510.64*, which
represents the amount
of rent owing and
compensation up to October 31, 2021, less the rent deposit $600.00, less
$39.36 in interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit
from July 1, 2017,
as well as less the $7,250.00
rent abatement the Landlord owes the Tenant pursuant to order TNT- 29287-20
issued February 7, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $19.73
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting November 1, 2021 to the date the Tenant completely moves out
of the unit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before
February 15, 2022, the Tenant will
start to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from February 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.




 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before
February 15, 2022, the Landlord shall
have the right, at any time thereafter to collect from the Tenant the full
amount owing or any balance outstanding as a result of this order.
