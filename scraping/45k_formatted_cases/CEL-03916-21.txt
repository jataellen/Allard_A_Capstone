Order under Section

Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-03916-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


172 ELLWOOD DRIVE
EAST CALEDON ON L7E1Z1


 




Between:


Robert Marinelli
  Mimi Marinelli


Landlords




 


and


 




 


Darryl
Ramnarine


Tenant



 
 
 
Robert Marinelli
and Mimi Marinelli (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Darryl Ramnarine (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. (L1 application)
 
The Landlords
also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because
the Landlord requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date. (L2 application)
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on January 13, 2022.
 
Only Mimi Marinelli, on behalf of the Landlords and the Landlord's Legal Representative, Bryan Rubin, attended the hearing. As of 9:46 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Nicole Marinelli testified
as a witness for the Landlord.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 application
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective September
11, 2021.
 
2.    
The monthly
is $2,299.50.
 
3.    
The Landlords collected a rent deposit of $2,259.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.




 
4.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from February 1, 2018 to November 30, 2021.
 
5.    
The Tenant
paid $2,299.50 on November 1, 2021.
 
6.    
The total amount the Tenant owes at time of hearing
is $11,698.50 comprised of arrears
($11,497.50) and the application filing fee ($201.00).
 
L2 Application
 
7.    
The Landlords in good faith
requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation. I say this for
the reasons that follow.
 
8.       
The Landlord’s
application is based on a notice of termination issued pursuant to s.48 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act”) alleging the Landlords daughter
wishes to live in the rental
unit. The notice is dated September 29, 2021 and sets out a date for
termination of the tenancy of November 30, 2021. No prior notices of this
nature have been served to this or other tenants within the past 2 years. The
daughter’s affidavit was filed with the L2 application.
 
9.    
The Landlord’s undisputed testimony is that
their daughter recently graduated and found
a full-time job. As she has lived for the past five years o her own while at
school, she wants a place of her own, but her income level is limited.
Therefore, the N12 notice was served s she could move in for at least a
one-year period, rent-free; this will allow her to establish herself for the
future.
 
10.  The Landlord also testified that the Tenant
received the one-month compensation pursuant
to section 48.1 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2016, by way of November
2021 rent being waived. An email sent to the Tenant, dated November 10, 2021,
corroborated the Landlord’s testimony; the email was entered into evidence.
 
11.  The daughter, Nicole Marinelli, testified
that she moved back home in April 2021 after graduating and found employment in
August 2021. As she has been on her own the last 5 years, she wanted her own place. Further, she is working from
home and requires her own private pace to conduct
her work properly. She intends on living in her parents’
rental unit for at least one-year and will not have to pay rent which
will help get herself established. She hopes t move in as soon as possible.
 
12.  Based on the undisputed evidence
and testimony before
me, I am satisfied the Landlords
have taken all of the necessary steps pursuant to section 48 of the Act.
 
Relief from
Eviction
 
13. 
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
The Tenant has not made any




 
effort to repay
the Landlord and did not attend to submit any section 83 considerations. The
arrears order is not voidable as the tenancy is also terminated pursuant to the
L2 application for the Landlords’ daughter
to move into the unit at the earliest available
date.
 
14.  The Landlord’s Legal Representative
entered into evidence an email from the Landlord
to the Tenant dated October 6, 2021 requesting a repayment plan; the
Tenant did not respond. As the Tenant has paid only one month out of the last
6-month period, the Landlord is seeking
a standard 11-day
order. The Landlord
is also seeking
a standard 11- day order for termination based on the
N12 notice, as the daughter wishes to move in as soon as possible.
 
15.  This order contains
all the reasons for the decision within
it. No further reasons shall be
issued.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Pursuant to the L2
application, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated, as of
January 28, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before January 28, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlords $10,464.24*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to
January 17, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the
rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlords $75.60
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 18, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlords $201.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before January
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after January 29, 2022.
