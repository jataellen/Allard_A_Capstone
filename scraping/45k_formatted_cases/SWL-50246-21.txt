Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jennifer Johnston


Tenant



 
 
 
County Of Lambton - Housing Dept
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Jennifer Johnston (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in
the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another
tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application
was heard via video conference on February 14, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative Tina Buono attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     This L2 application was brought by the Landlord as a
result of the Tenant not providing verification of tenant’s insurance which substantially interfered with the Landlord’s lawful rights, privileges or interests.
 
2.    
The Landlord served an N5 notice on March 2, 2021 to the Tenant.
The Tenant had 7
days to void the N5 but failed
to so. As a result,
the Landlord was entitled
to file an L2 application,
paying a fee to do so because of the Tenant’s breach.
 
3.     Despite the breach,
the Landlord’s Legal
Representative stated that prior to the hearing, the Tenant did verify they had
insurance.
 
4.     Based on the uncontested evidence at the hearing, I am
satisfied that the Tenant substantially interfered with the Landlords’ lawful rights, privileges or interest. The




File Number: SWL-50246-21
 
Landlord’s Legal Representative is not requesting eviction of the Tenant but is seeking reimbursement of the fee they paid
for filing the application.

1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
the amount of $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application on or before March 24, 2022.

amount owing on or before March 24, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 25, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
