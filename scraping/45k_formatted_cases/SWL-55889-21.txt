File Number: SWL-55889-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


1603, 1225 RIVERSIDE DRIVE
W WINDSOR ON N9A0A2


 




Between:


Dante
  Capaldi


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Charles Mady


Tenant



 
 
 
Dante Capaldi (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Charles Mady (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 27, 2022. Only the Landlord
attended the hearing. As of
3:04 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from December 1, 2020 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective October 16, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $4,000.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since the application
was filed I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance
with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact
of COVID-19 on the parties
and whether the Landlord
attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
the Act.
 
6.     The Landlord’s claim for the period ending January 31, 2022 exceeds
the Board’s monetary
jurisdiction of $35,000.00. The
Landlord indicated a desire to proceed with
the hearing of the application and voluntarily waived
the portion of the claim that exceeds the Board’s monetary
jurisdiction.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 21, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$35,000.00*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 10, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 21, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 21, 2022, then starting February
22, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 22, 2022.
 
7.     If, on or before February 21, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $58,286.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 22, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
