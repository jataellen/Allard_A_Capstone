Karim Aziz


Tenant



 
 
Marita Coelho (the 'Landlord') applied in this L9
application seeking an order to collect rent arrears from Karim Aziz (the
'Tenant').
 
This application was heard by telephone/video-conference on December 2, 2021.
 
The Landlord Marita Coelho
attended the hearing.
The Tenant Karim Aziz attended
the hearing with his legal
representative Clive Preddie. The Tenant’s witness Muhammad Adnan Afzal
attended a portion of the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.                     
The Landlord alleged the Tenant did not pay the total rent the Tenant was required to pay
for the month of April, 2020. Because of the alleged arrears, the Landlord
filed this L9 application with the Board on April 30, 2020.
 
2.                     
The Tenant was in possession at the time the L9 application was filed. The parties
disputed the vacate date as described below.
 
3.                     
There were no NSF or administrative fees claimed.
 
4.                     
The monthly rent was $2,290.00, due on the first (1st) day of each month.
 
5.                     
The Tenant made no payments to the Landlord
after the application was filed on April 30, 2020 but before the hearing date.
 
6.                     
On December 14, 2014 (the tenancy
started February 1, 2015), the Landlord collected
a last month’s rent deposit of $2,100.00 from the Tenant. Interest had never paid on the rent
deposit. Interest is owing on
the rent deposit from the date of collection, December 14, 2014, up to the date determined to be the vacate
date.




 
Disputed Notice
of Termination & Vacate Date
 
7.                     
While the Landlord did not
characterize her submissions in this way, I deduced from the evidence that she was alleging proper
notice of termination had never been given to her
by the Tenant.
 
8.                     
The Landlord claimed that she
received an email on October 29, 2020 from Reem Haroon (the Tenant’s lawyer)
letting her know the key fobs had been left with concierge. The Landlord
testified that this was the first time she became aware the Tenant had returned key fobs – therefore, it was her submission that the vacate date was October 29, 2020 since the Tenant had possession
and control over the rental unit until the key fobs were returned. The Tenant admitted
on cross-examination that his
lawyer’s letter failed to mention when exactly the key
fobs had been left at concierge, only that they were ready for pickup. The
Landlord testified that she went the next day on October 30, 2020 to pickup the
key fobs.
 
9.                     
The Tenant claimed that he had
given notice to terminate several months prior. The Tenant alleged his letter
to the Landlord dated March 14, 2020 provided written notice that the tenancy
would be ending on May 1, 2020. (Note:
the letter was actually from the Tenant’s business Living
Suites Toronto, which
the Landlord speculated was the Tenant’s operation of a short-term
furnished rental business out of the rental unit. This issue was not disputed
during the hearing.)
 
10.                 
Section 44(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) allows a tenant to give written notice
to their landlord
to end a monthly
tenancy. The notice
must give at least 60 days before the termination date which
must fall on the last day of a rental period.
 
11.                 
Based on the Tenant’s own admission, his letter of March 14, 2020 did not
provide the Landlord with at
least 60 days of notice required by the Act. His letter provided a termination date of May 1, 2020 instead
of May 31, 2020 (which should have been
the earliest available termination date which fell at the end of a rental
period).
 
12.                 
I found further problems with the
Tenant’s letter of March 14, 2020. Paragraph
2 stated that since rent was already paid for March, that the last month’s rent
deposit should be applied to April 2020. Again, I found
this to violate the Act. If the Tenant
had given valid notice on March 14, 2020, the final
month of the tenancy should have been May 2020 and the rent deposit should have
been applied for the month of May 2020. The Act is clear in section 106(10)
that the landlord
shall apply a rent deposit
for the last rent period
before the tenancy terminates.
 
13.                 
The Landlord admitted she received
the Tenant’s March 14, 2020 letter. In
response, she wrote to the Tenant by email on March 17, 2020. In that email she advised she was
attaching an N9 form that she required him to fill out. She also wrote that the notice required was 60 days hence the termination date should be May
31, 2020. She seemed willing to
entertain the idea of giving back the rent to the Tenant if a new tenant could
be found for May 1-31, 2020, but she wrote near the end of her email that it
may be challenging to find someone
new given the current scenario. (I note this was just after the COVID19 provincial emergency shutdown
which came into effect on March 16, 2020.)




 
14.                 
I found credibility problems
with the Tenant based on his testimony about what happened thereafter. Firstly, the Tenant
wrote the termination date on the N9 form as May 1, 2020, even though the
Landlord’s email of March 17th said it should be May 31, 2020.
 
15.                 
Secondly, the Tenant filled
in the signature date on the N9 as March 14, 2020. I found it illogical how the N9 could be backdated
3 days when the blank N9 was first provided to the Tenant by the Landlord in
her March 17th email. The Tenant made no submissions that he had filled in any N9 form
earlier than March 17, 2020.
 
16.                 
Notwithstanding the defects in the
March 14, 2020 letter, it appears the Landlord was willing to assist
the Tenant to perfect
the notice by requesting a completed N9 so that she could
have proper written
notice on record. She provided a blank N9 form with her March 17, 2020 email. Unfortunately, the Tenant filled in the N9
form incorrectly by again referring to the termination date as May 1st instead of May 31, 2020. If it had been completed properly in
accordance with the Act, the N9 could have served as the first proper
written notice to the Landlord regarding a termination of tenancy effective May 31, 2021. However, due to the same
deficiencies as the March 14th letter, the N9 form was also invalid notice.
 
17.                 
The Tenant’s legal representative
characterized the N9 as an addendum to the written notice of termination
provided by the Tenant’s letter of March 14, 2020. I disagree. I already
explained above why the March 14, 2020 was invalid, did not comply with the Act,
and was not proper notice of termination.
Submitting a different form of written notice, which contained the same 2 fatal defects
as the first written notice,
could not cure either the first notice, or stand as
notice itself.
 
18.                 
Similarly, offering
money several months
later (ie: offering to pay for rent for the month of May 2020) did not cure fatal defects in
either the March 14th letter or N9 notice of termination. The reason 60 days’ notice is required
from the outset is so landlords can have the benefit of that time to arrange
their affairs and seek a new tenant if desired.
 
19.                 
The Tenant’s lawyer Kormans LLP
sent the Landlord a letter on June 29, 2020. The statements made by the unknown writer
(signature page was not provided)
in paragraph 4 did not comply
with the Act because the writer reiterated the same deficiencies as the
Tenant by insisting the March 14th letter was valid notice, and again reiterated that the
termination date was May 1, 2020.
 
20.                 
The letter from Kormans
LLP confirmed that rent for May 2020 had not been paid since it stated “our client will pay you what is
owing for May, 2020”. Offering this
at the end of June 2020 did not cure the deficient notices of termination given
March 14 or 17, 2020.
 
21.                 
A
significant omission from the
letter, which will be described
further below, was the fact that there was no mention of when
exactly the key fobs had been returned, or that they had ever been returned.




 
Disputed Return
of Keys and Fobs
 
22.                 
Note: the issue of exactly how
many keys and fobs there were did not arise during the hearing. I refer in this
order to keys or fobs interchangeably, but there may have been specific sets
for various doors (ie: outside entry, storage, front door of rental unit, etc).
The overall number of keys are not important to my analysis
as it is common practice
for tenants to be expected to return all keys/fobs at the end of a
tenancy.
 
23.                 
The Tenant testified that he moved
out of the rental unit on March 20, 2020. He
said he returned the keys on
March 20, 2020 to the concierge. He testified the rental unit was not used after March 20, 2020. He testified that 99.9% of the
items left in the rental
unit were the Landlord’s since it was
a furnished rental. He admitted he
may have left a few personal items behind but his representative submitted they
were abandoned. The Tenant alluded
that he moved so quickly (only 6 days after his March 14th letter) because it was
COVID19 and he didn’t want to be in the city.
 
24.                 
I highly doubt that the Tenant returned all keys/fobs
to the concierge on March 20, 2020, because if he had, why didn’t
he tell the Landlord about it? The Tenant was in direct contact with the
Landlord on both March 14, 2020 and March 17, 2020. In fact it was the Tenant himself who first initiated
contact on March 14, 2020 by attempting to provide written notice of
termination directly to the Landlord. Next, the Tenant emailed the N9 form he
had filled out directly to the Landlord on March 17, 2020.
 
25.                 
Perhaps it is possible the Tenant was only referring to his own set of keys, which he may
have returned at a different time compared to any copies his associate or
others may have had – but I did not hear any submissions about it.
 
26.                 
The Tenant submitted that his
associate Mr. Afzal dealt with many
issues throughout the tenancy such as cable and internet. While I don’t doubt Mr. Afzal was an
agent-of-sorts for the Tenant
and did communicate about some issues such as internet
or cable, I found
the testimony of the Tenant’s witness and the alleged texts between the witness
and the Landlord’s son Marvin raised further credibility issues.
 
27.                 
I will note that there was a
dispute between the parties over which people were communicating with each other
regarding the tenancy.
The Landlord admitted
she has a son named Marvin but denied his involvement in dealing with
the rental unit. On the other hand,
the Tenant relied on his witness Mr. Afzal to show they were dealing with Marvin.
 
28.                 
Mr. Afzal’s texts did not corroborate the Tenant’s story that he moved out March 20, 2020
or returned keys/fobs on March
20, 2020. This is another reason
I found credibility issues with the Tenant’s testimony.
 
29.                 
The first text conversation between Mr. Afzal and “Marvin”
happened on March 25, 2020. Marvin indicated to “Adnan” (Mr.
Afzal) they were “Still waiting to hear from you. Please let me know.” Mr. Afzal replied,
“I will have Karim reply
today on it officially. When do you wish to start the showing so we can
arrange for the keys for you. Earlier its let out the better for us as well.”




 
30.                 
Mr. Afzal seemed to be operating
on the belief that no keys/fobs had been returned
since his message to Marvin said “…so we can arrange for the keys for
you”. Mr. Afzal also seemed to be relying
on Karim (the Tenant) to reply “officially” on the issue of termination of tenancy. These messages lead me to consider that
the Tenant and/or his witness were still in
care, control, and possession of the
rental unit on March 25, 2020 since
they were trying to coordinate showings. This
contradicted the Tenant’s testimony that they had moved out March 20, 2020.
 
31.                 
“Marvin” then replied that they
were still waiting to hear back officially from Karim regarding the N9 form. Mr. Afzal wrote “we have sent the notice
and that should be acknowledged from that date please”.
Marvin replied, “Just to clarify
again tenancy end date should be May 31.”
 
32.                 
The second text conversation between Mr. Afzal and Marvin happened
in the Spring and Summer,
2020. Mr. Afzal testified that he
text Marvin on May 20, 2020 asking if they could talk. He said Marvin replied the next day on May 21, 2020 but they did not actually
connect that day. On May 23, 2020 Mr.
Afzal reached out by saying “Hi Marvin. Missed your message. Am available
anytime today after 5.” There was no
reply after May 23, 2020. Mr. Afzal’s
next message was on July 21, 2020 stating “Hi
Marvin. Just checking whether
you were able to pick up your keys from the front desk at 300 front”
 
33.                 
The text on July 21, 2020 was
several months after the Tenant alleged he moved
out on March 20, 2020. Mr. Afzal did not provide any explanation
for the delay or what conversations transpired in between the text messages.
 
34.                 
I
found it strange that the front desk at a different
address “300 front” was referenced in the final text, but neither party raised this as an issue
during the hearing.
 
35.                 
I also found it odd that through
the entire sequence of events described above, neither the Tenant nor Mr.
Afzal proactively confirmed with the Landlord or Marvin that the keys/ fobs had been received. The
reasonable person who was ending a tenancy would likely confirm their
landlord had gotten possession back. While
possession is not solely determined by keys/fobs, it is an important
factor to consider.
I would have expected any
reasonable and prudent tenant to confirm that possession had been properly
turned over and that
keys/fobs had been received – especially if there were both a furniture and key
deposit they were hoping to get back, and to ensure they were not on the hook
for ongoing/future rent.
 
36.                 
I found it questionable why neither
party had Marvin
testify as a witness. The Landlord should have known the Tenant may refer to conversations between
Muhammad Adnan Afzal and
Marvin since this disclosure was provided to her at least a week before the
hearing. The Landlord could have
asked her son Marvin to attend the hearing as her witness, to corroborate her
claims that he was not involved with the rental.
 
37.                 
Similarly, the Tenant should have
summonsed Marvin as a witness to corroborate the conversations Mr. Afzal said he had with Marvin.
Marvin’s testimony would have been especially helpful considering
Mr. Afzal admitted some of the communication between himself and Marvin was by phone, not text. Also, Mr.
Afzal seemed to have forgotten




 
some of the details
of what happened
in between the time periods of the various
texts. Perhaps Marvin could have filled in those gaps.
 
Disputed Possession of Rental Unit during Spring/Summer of 2020
 
38.                 
What happened next made me
question the credibility of the Landlord. Although
she testified that Marvin had not been involved with the rental unit, I found
it quite the coincidence that the day after Mr. Afzal’s final text to Marvin on
July 21, 2020 asking whether he was able to pick up
the keys, that she entered the rental unit on July 22, 2020
to do an inspection and take pictures of various items. The Landlord probably heard about Mr. Afzal’s text to Marvin
on July 21, 2020, thus she entered
the rental unit the very next day.
 
39.                 
Her pictures showed some furniture
(ie: round glass dining table, 4 chairs, brown side table, bed with pillows)
and some smaller
items (ie: vacuum,
coffee container, table
lamp, fan). The Landlord claimed these personal effects showed the
Tenant was still in possession of the rental unit.
 
40.                 
The Tenant disagreed. He said the furniture belonged
to the Landlord since the rental unit was supposed to be furnished. The Tenant admitted that since it was
COVID19 there may have been a few personal items left behind,
but nearly everything left behind was the
Landlord’s.
 
41.                 
The Landlord submitted that other
events occurred later in the Summer 2020 such as having to enter the rental
unit on an emergency basis to clean up a water leak from the fridge/freezer,
and alleging the utility bills throughout that period of time pointed to the
rental unit continuing to be occupied or used by the Tenant
or their business.
I did not find these
submissions particularly relevant based on the other evidence presented and
findings made.
 
Remedy
 
42.                 
I note that all this occurred during
a challenging time. COVID19 had just plunged
the world into a pandemic. I
recall that the provincial government issued a lockdown on March 16, 2020 prohibiting non-essential travel and other restrictions. Throughout the year in
2020 there were various restrictions and lockdowns.
 
43.                 
I found creditability issues with
both sides. On one hand, the Landlord
tried to present the story that she dealt with the tenancy herself
and that her son Marvin
was not involved. I highly doubt this.
The testimony from the Tenant (that he authorized his associate to deal
with some matters regarding the tenancy), Mr. Afzal’s testimony (that he had
phone calls and texts with the Landlord’s son Marvin), and the text
conversations dated March 25, 2020 onwards,
all revealed that the Landlord’s son Marvin was likely involved
in some capacity. The Landlord failed to bring her son as a
witness to corroborate her story that he had not been involved.
The Landlord coincidently entered the rental
unit for inspection one day after the final text
from Mr. Afzal to Marvin.




 
44.                 
The Landlord knew or ought to have known on March
14, 2020 that her Tenant
was trying to cancel the
contract and terminate the tenancy. I
agree with her that she did not receive
the benefit of at least 60 days notice. Notwithstanding that, she was willing
to have the Tenant properly fill out an N9 form. Again, the Tenant failed to
comply with the Act, but again, the Landlord knew or ought to have known
the Tenant was trying to end the tenancy.
 
45.                 
Even though the Tenant made fatal
defects in both notices, I do not agree with the Landlord’s attempt to try to act like she never knew the
Tenant was leaving all the way until the letter from the
Tenant’s lawyer on October 29, 2020. She
knew the earliest termination date
could have been May 31, 2020 since she
provided that date herself to the Tenant.
 
46.                 
I find that after May 31, 2020 had
passed, the Landlord failed to mitigate her losses as required by section 16 of the Act. The Landlord relied on the deficiencies in
the Tenant’s termination date to sit back and do nothing to try to find out for
herself if the Tenant had vacated through the Spring, Summer, and beginning of
Fall, 2020. She conveniently claimed
the Tenant had been in possession of the rental unit that whole time since she
saw some items left inside and had not gotten the keys/fobs
back. As the landlord, it was
her duty to also proactively try to find out if the unit may have been
abandoned.
 
47.                 
I find on a balance of probabilities
that the Landlord learned about the return of the keys/fobs on July 21, 2020
when Marvin received the text from Mr. Afzal.
The very next day she inspected the unit on July 22, 2020. She also had to arrange an emergency entry
to deal with a water leak. She knew
the Tenant had not responded to her notice of entry. She knew or ought to have
known that the rental unit had been abandoned or vacated through the summer
months. She took pictures of mould in the fridge, which should have indicated
to her that it was likely not being used. The letter from Kormons LLP dated
July 29, 2020 also mentioned the Tenant had vacated. Even though the
termination date of May 1, 2020 was incorrect, the letter from Kormons LLP
should have given the Landlord enough information to try to communicate with
the Tenant to find out whether the rental
unit was being used or not, and where her keys/fobs were.
I also find it strange the
Landlord did not reach out to the Tenant regarding unpaid over half a year.
 
48.                 
I find the Landlord failed to
proactively try to find
out from the Tenant what was going
on with the tenancy. I find it opportunistic of her to try to claim for rent arrears
for over half a
year. She knew or ought to have known
the Tenant’s short-term rental business had probably been drastically reduced or even
stopped after COVID19 lockdowns came into effect.
 
49.                 
Much like the credibility issues I
had with the Landlord, I do not believe the Tenant was completely honest
either. Knowing that COVID19
lockdowns were going to seriously impact their short-term furnished rental business, I find the Tenant and his witness
tried to concoct the story
that they gave notice before the lockdown came into effect. They tried to get out of the rental contract early
and tried to get off the hook from paying any further rent after March 2020. The Tenant incorrectly tried to apply the
last month’s deposit to April 2020 and failed to provide at least 60 days
notice to terminate the tenancy on several occasions. While I do not doubt the rental unit was barely used or maybe
not at




 
all after COVID19 lockdowns came
into effect, this does not remove the Tenant from the responsibility to
continue to pay rent until the tenancy is properly terminated. Improper notice was given on both March 14
and 17, 2020. The Tenant back-dated
the N9. I do not believe the Tenant
gave back all keys/fobs on March 20, 2020. He
failed to communicate either that he had moved out on March 20 or that he had
returned the keys/fobs to concierge directly with the Landlord, even though he
had been communicating only with her in the days before on March 14 and 17, 2020. He continued
to use the wrong termination date of May 1 instead of changing it to May 31,
2020. He never provided proof the rent
had been paid for either April or May 2020. In his testimony at the hearing, he said he
“will” pay for May, and the letter from Kormon’s LLP offering to pay May 2020,
indicated to me that the rent for May 2020 remained unpaid as of the hearing
date. The Tenant tried to correct his
invalid notice by being willing to pay rent up to May 31, 2020. His lawyer’s letter from June 29, 2020 failed
to refer to the date the keys/fobs were actually returned.
 
50.                 
In the circumstances, I find both
sides failed to treat each other proactively and honestly. Both were not forthright with the Board. I find the fault lies more with the Tenant since he started off the entire process
incorrectly in both his March 14, 2020 letter and in the N9 by failing to give May 31, 2020 as the
termination date. I found the
Landlord slightly more credible than the Tenant since the Tenant’s
own witness provided
contradictory evidence.
 
51.                 
As a result, I find it would be
fair to “meet somewhere in the middle”. The
alleged rent arrears claimed by the Landlord
span from April 1, 2020 to October
29, 2020. This is just under 7 months of rent arrears. Since
I found the Landlord slightly more credible and since I found slightly more fault on the Tenant, the split will be 4 months rent given to the Landlord, and 3
months saved or discounted off the
claim for the Tenant. This coincides
with the July 21, 2020 text to Marvin and the
Landlord’s inspection of July 22, 2020. The Landlord is entitled to rent for the
months of April, May, June, and July 2020.
 
52.                 
The Tenant shall receive
a discount off the
total rent arrears claimed by the Landlord, for the months of August,
September, and up to October 29, 2020. Since
the Landlord is holding a rent deposit of $2,100.00, that deposit and any
interest owing on it shall be applied to the month of July 2020. The termination date and vacate date will be deemed
to be July 31, 2020 (which
falls at the end of a rental
period). Interest on the rent deposit
shall be deemed to be owing from the date of collection up to July 31, 2020.
 
53.                 
The Tenant alleged a key fob
deposit of $200.00 should be credited. I
did not receive any proof from the Tenant that the deposit had been paid to the
Landlord. While the Tenant claimed he
had initially paid the Landlord $4000.00 at the start of the tenancy (comprised of $2,100.00 first month’s rent,
plus $2,100.00 last month’s rent deposit, plus
$600.00 furniture deposit, plus $200.00
key deposit, less $1000.00 for buying
a sofa on behalf of the Landlord), there was no proof provided that the key
deposit was actually paid. The Tenant
said the Landlord did not provide him with a receipt; however, the Tenant also
did not provide any bank draft, email transfer, etc. to show he had actually
paid it. There were no submissions he had paid in cash. Even if he had said they payment was made in a
form that he could not provide
proof, I would have weighed that in light of the credibility
problems described above.




 
54.                 
The Landlord disputed she ever
received the key deposit. She
submitted that her agent had to email the Tenant
to remind him the deposit
remained outstanding. Since I did not
have concrete proof from the Tenant that the key fob deposit was paid, $200.00
will not be credited from the total amount owing.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The tenancy is terminated as of July 31, 2020, the date the Tenant
was deemed to give
vacant possession back to the Landlord.
 
Refer to Schedule 1: Summary of Calculations
 
2.       
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $6,849.56*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to the deemed termination/vacate date of July 31, 2020, less
the rent deposit and the interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.       
The Tenant shall also pay the
Landlord $190.00 to reimburse for the cost of the L9 application filing
fee. While the Landlord was not entirely
successful in recovering the full period of
rent arrears that she claimed, I found she was owed the majority (4 months) of
