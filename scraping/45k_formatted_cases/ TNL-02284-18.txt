MA
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict ME and
(‘AR’) (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
The
Tenants applied for an order determining that the Landlord has collected or
retained money illegally.  The Tenants also applied for an order determining
that the Landlord failed to meet the Landlord's maintenance obligations under
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') or failed to comply with
health, safety, housing or maintenance standards and the Tenants applied for an
order determining that Landlord harassed,
obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with them and substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential
complex by the Tenants.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on April 23, 2018.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s representative, JP, the Tenant AR, on
behalf of both Tenants, and the Tenants’ representative, AK, attended the
hearing.  The Tenant was accompanied by an interpreter.  (‘MY’), the Landlord’s
husband, attended a portion of the hearing as a witness.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenants’ representative raised, as a first preliminary matter, a question about
the timing of the service of the Landlord’s N4 notice on the Tenants, alleging
that the N4 was not in fact delivered on February 2, 2018 as the Certificate of
Service indicates.  The Tenants relied, in support of this allegation, on the
fact that the Landlord’s bank statement (Exhibit 1) for the period showed that
the February rent cheque was not returned “NSF” until February 6, 2018.  The
Tenants submitted that since the N4 showed the February 2018 rent as not having
been paid, the N4 must have been prepared on or after February 6, 2018.
 
2.      According
to the uncontroverted testimony of the Landlord,  MY, who is the Landlord’s
husband and who manages all matters pertaining to this tenancy, contacted the
bank on February 2, 2018 and was told that the cheque was not honoured.  I
find, on the basis of the Landlord’s testimony and the certificate of service
that the N4 was served on February 2, 2018.
 
3.      As
a second preliminary matter the Tenant’s representative indicated that the
Tenant was not pursuing the claims under the T6 application regarding the
Landlord’s failure to meet the Landlord’s maintenance obligations and requested
Board’s consent to withdraw that portion of the Tenant’s application.
Tenants’ Claim Regarding
Illegal Charge by the Landlord
4.      The
Landlord did not dispute the Tenant’s allegation that the Landlord had
collected $500.00 at the outset of the tenancy as a deposit for gas,
electricity and a key.
 
5.      This
deposit is prohibited by the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
and the Landlord must repay the deposit to the Tenant.
 
Tenant’s Claim for Harassment
 
6.      The
Tenants’ representative indicated that the Tenants’ application pertaining to
harassment and interference on the part of the Landlord was primarily based on
issues relating to the question of whether the unit rented by the Tenants was
comprised of only the main floor of the residential complex, a house, as the
Landlord alleged, or was instead comprised of the main floor and the basement.
The Tenants sought a rent abatement in the amount of $4,800.00, at a rate of
$400.00 per month for twelve months as compensation for the inability of the
Tenants to use the basement.
 
7.      I
find that the unit which was the subject of the tenancy agreement was limited
to the main floor of the house in question and only the laundry room in the
basement.
 
8.      The
Tenants’ representative submitted that the wording of the lease was
determinative of the composition of the unit.  The lease (Exhibit 1) referred
to the address of the house and made no reference to the main floor.  The
Tenants’ representative submitted that the common law parole evidence rule
precluded my consideration of other evidence as to the nature of the contract
between the parties. Subsection 202(1) of the Act states:
 
“In
making findings on an application, the Board shall ascertain the real substance
of all transactions and activities relating to a residential complex or a
rental unit and the good faith of the participants….” 
 
9.      This
provision of the Act not only allows me to consider matters outside the wording
of the lease document, but it compels me to do so.
 
10.   I
find that the Landlord intended to rent out only the main floor rather than
both the main floor and the basement.  The Landlord presented documents
(Exhibits 3 and 4) showing details about the listing of the rental unit at the
time.  The description and pictures of the unit in the listing refer only to
main floor rooms (aside from the laundry in the basement).
 
11.   The
description goes to the belief of the Landlord but is not determinative of the
terms of the agreement between the parties.  On the contrary, I find that the
Tenants did not view the materials set out in Exhibits 3 or 4.  The Tenant AR
testified that he found the unit by responding to an advertisement in a
newspaper.  He viewed the apartment and did not review any listing documents or
photographs.  MY testified that he showed a copy of the listing to AR.  I find
that it is more likely than not that even if the Landlord provided a copy of
the listing to the Tenant AR, the Tenant AR did not review or rely on it.  The
Tenant AR was assisted at the hearing by an interpreter and no evidence was
presented that the Tenant AR was able to understand written English even if the
listing had been provided.
 
12.   Nonetheless
I find, as follows, that it is more likely than not that the true nature of the
tenancy agreement concerned only the main floor:
 
a)    The
Tenant AR testified that on visiting the house in response to the advertisement
he was shown around the house by MY.  The Tenant AR acknowledged that he viewed
only the main floor and did not view the basement;
 
b)    The
Landlord testified that the basement is a fully contained unit with bedrooms, a
kitchen, living area and bathroom.  This set up is inconsistent with the
basement being a mere adjunct to the main floor unit; and
 
c)    The
parties agree that when the Tenants first took occupancy of the unit the
basement unit was already occupied.  The Tenant AR testified that he did not
object initially to the occupation of the basement by others “as a courtesy to
the Landlord”.  The Tenants did not seriously claim for the use of the basement
until other disputes arose between the Landlord and the Tenants about such
things as the allocation of utilities’ costs between the Tenants and the
occupants of the basement.
 
13.   I
find that the Tenants are not entitled to a rental rebate for the inability to
occupy the basement of the house.
Eviction on the Basis of
Rental Arrears
1.      The
Landlord alleges that the Tenant owes $7,600.00 in rent to April 30, 2018.  The
Tenant has, further to an earlier adjournment of the hearing of this matter,
paid $1,900.00 into the Board.
 
2.      The
Tenants allege that they made a rental payment for September 2017 that is
showing in the Landlord’s application materials as arrears.  The parties agree
that the rent cheque for September 2017 was returned NSF.  The Tenant AR
testified that he subsequently attended at the home of the Landlord and paid
her the rent in cash.  The Landlord denies receiving any payment from the
Tenants for the September 2017 rent and specifically denies receiving the rental
payment in cash from the Tenant AR.  The Landlord and MY both testified that
all matters relating to the administration of the tenancy with the Tenants were
managed by MY rather than by the Landlord.
 
3.      The
Tenant AR testified that he received the funds for the September 2017 case
payment by way of a loan from a friend and so has no record of funds being
withdrawn from his bank account for the payment.  Further, he repaid the friend
by working for the friend and so has no record of any funds being withdrawn
from his bank account to repay the friend.  
 
4.      I
find that the Tenant AR has failed to establish that he made the cash payment
he claims to have made in September 2017 and so I find that the rent for that
month remains owing to the Landlord.
 
5.      I
find that as of the date of the hearing the Tenant owed the Landlord the amount
set out in the L1/L9 update form provided at the hearing by the Landlord.
 
6.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,900.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from March 3, 2017
to February 16, 2018.
 
8.      The
Tenants have paid $1,900.00 to the Board in trust since the application was
filed. **.
 
9.      I
considered the submissions of the Tenant with respect to postponing the
termination of the tenancy in the event that I were to find that the Tenant
owed rental arrears, as I have done.  The Tenant AR requested that any
termination date in an order be set no earlier than May 31, 2018.
 
10.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until May 31, 2018 pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      In
accordance with subsection 200(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006,
I consent to the withdrawal of that portion of the Tenants’ application
pertaining to the Landlord’s failure to meet maintenance obligations.
 
2.      The
Landlord shall pay to the Tenants the sum of $550.00. This amount represents
$500.00 collected as a deposit for utilities, gas and a key plus $50.00 for the
Tenant’s cost of filing the application.
 
3.      The
total amount the Landlord owes to the Tenants is $550.00, payable to the
Tenants by way of deduction from the amount which the Tenants must pay to the
Landlord to void this order.
 
4.      Unless
the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated as of May 31, 2018.  The Tenants must move out of
the rental unit on or before May 31, 2018.
 
5.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $3,139.34*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to May 1, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit and less the amount of the $550.00
the the Landlord owes the Tenants.
 
6.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $62.47 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting May 2, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
 
7.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
8.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May 31,
2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from June 1, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
9.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before May 31, 2018, then starting June 1, 2018,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
10.   Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 1, 2018.
 
11.   If,
on or before May 31, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $7,240.00** to the Landlord
or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the
unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
12.   The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after June 1, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
13.   The
Board shall pay to the Landlord the amount of $1,900.00 together with any
accrued interest.
