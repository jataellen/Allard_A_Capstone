Order under Section
77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-25112-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1, 2577 COUNTY LINE 74 HAGERSVILLE ON N0A1H0


 




Between:


Brian Hagan
  Kyle Hagan


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Ally Bartlett Dylan Bristo


Tenants



 
 
 
Brian Hagan and Kyle Hagan (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dylan Bristo and Ally Bartlett
(the 'Tenants') because the Tenants entered into an agreement to terminate the
tenancy.
 
The application was sent to a hearing
because only one Tenant signed
the N11 agreement to terminate.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 14, 2021.
 
Only the Landlords, and the Landlords’ legal representative, L. Vreugdenhil, attended
the hearing. The Tenant, D.
Bristo’s father, J. Bristo, logged in at 3:40 p.m., after the hearing was held.
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants
did not attend
the hearing, scheduled
for 1 p.m. I waited over an hour, and then I proceeded to hear the matter
on an uncontested basis.
 
2.     The Landlord’s L3 application for eviction
was based on an N11 agreement to terminate, signed by only one Tenant on August 26, 2021, for a termination date of August
31, 2021.
 
3.    
The Landlord, B. Hagan
(BH), said that the parties came to an agreement to terminate the tenancy
after the Tenants
had caused some unpleasant incidents
that occurred in the
residential complex.
 
4.    
BH said that they negotiated over the date of termination, and the Tenant
D. Bristo (DB), suggested August 31, 2021. BH said that the other Tenant, A. Bartlett
(AB) was not present during the discussions, nor when the N11 agreement to
terminate was signed.




 
 
 
5.    
BH said that AB was present
during a discussion with DB outside
the residential complex. BH said that AB heard the discussion about vacating the rental
unit, and she appeared to be in
agreement with everything under discussion, and BH believed they were acting
together in their plans to leave the rental unit.
 
6.    
BH said that AB was also present when he had a discussion with DB on August 31, 2021,
about where to leave their keys upon departure. BH said that, at that time, the Tenants told him they had not
yet found elsewhere to live, and he agreed to let them stay for another three
days.
 
7.    
BH said that all the tenancy
discussions were held with DB, and that he acted
on behalf of the couple, and
he paid the rent. He further said
that DB always referred to the Tenants as a couple, eg. Referring to himself
and AB as “we”.
 
8.     The Landlords submit that the Tenants both
agreed to vacate on August 31, 2021. The
Landlords submits said that the Tenants had many reasons to agree to end the
tenancy in an amicable way. The Landlords further submit that they always dealt with DB, and DB
always acted on behalf of both Tenants with respect to the tenancy, and it was
DB who paid the rent. The Landlords
said that the Tenants were served with all the Board documentation, and they
were reminded of their obligation to attend.
 
9.    
I find, on the
uncontested evidence of the Landlords, that the Tenants both agreed to terminate
the tenancy on August 31, 2021. The
evidence proves, on a balance of probabilities, that they did not leave on August 31, 2021,
because they had not yet found
another place to live, and not because there was no agreement to leave from
both Tenants.
 
10.  The Landlords said that the Tenants were
well aware of the hearing, and they had an opportunity to attend to dispute whether
there was a true agreement
to vacate the rental
unit. In addition, DB’s father
attempted to attend the hearing almost 3 hours late, which corroborates the
Landlords’ testimony that the Tenants were aware of the hearing and they chose
not to participate on time in order to refute the Landlord’s application.
 
11.  Consequently, I find that the Landlords and
the Tenants signed an agreement to terminate
the tenancy as of August 31, 2021 and the Tenants did not move out of the
rental unit by the termination date set out in the agreement.
 
It
is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 15, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.




 
3.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after January 16, 2022.
