Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-03797-18
 










 
 
 

IPX
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict FZ and
AK (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe.
 
This
application was heard in Newmarket on June 4, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s Representative, JS attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required
to pay for the period from June 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018.  Because of the
arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination.
2.     
The monthly rent as of the date of the hearing is $1,752.99. 
3.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,662.00 from the
Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
4.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the
period from January 1, 2018 to June 6, 2018.
5.     
The Tenants paid $3,162.00 after the application was filed.
6.     
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance
with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out
of the rental unit on or before June 17, 2018.
2.     
As of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and
compensation the Landlord is entitled to by $445.97*.
3.     
However, the Landlord is authorized to offset the following
amounts from the amount the Landlord owes the Tenants:
$57.63 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting June 7, 2018
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit, and
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
4.     
The Landlord or the Tenants shall pay to the other any sum of
money that is owed as a result of this order.
5.     
If the unit is not vacated on or before June 17, 2018, then
starting June 18, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
6.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
June 18, 2018.
7.     
If, on or before June 17, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of
$2,826.09** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction
will be void.  This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the
Tenants could remain in the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on
time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.     
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that
subsection on or after June 18, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession
to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during
the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
