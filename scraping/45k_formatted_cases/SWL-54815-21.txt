Darryl Buti Maegan
Buti


Tenants



 
 
 
Port Burwell Family Residences. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Maegan Buti and Darryl Buti (the
'Tenants') because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they
permitted in the residential complex have substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or
another tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard via video conference on January 10, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Robert
Rose and Landlord’s Witness Tina Friesen attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord
has brought an L2 application pursuant to an N5 notice
of termination given under section 64 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006, claiming that the Tenants have failed to pay water
bills as required by the tenancy agreement. The N5 notice was served by mail on
August 18th, 2021,
with a termination date of September 10, 2021.
 
2.     The Landlord presented a copy of a lease agreement for
the rental unit, signed by the Tenants on July 1, 2015. Page 2 of the lease indicates
that utilities and service charges are the responsibility of the
Tenants.
 
3.     The Landlord also provided water
bills and a ledger showing
the balance outstanding as the Tenants had not paid the water bills.




 
4.    
The Tenants were served
with a notice of hearing
that was issued
November 1, 2021. As
at November 19, 2021, the Tenants paid $2,000.00 towards the water bills and
then a further $2,027.94 towards the water bills on November 22, 2021 so that
the amount was paid in full as at the
date of this hearing.
 
5.     Notwithstanding that the water bill arrears were
subsequently paid in full prior to this hearing, the Landlord takes
the position that the Tenants
had an outstanding water utility bill in excess of $4,000.00 which
substantially interfered with the Landlord’s lawful rights and seek an order
from the Board.
 
6.     The Landlord and Tenant Board has in the past accepted that non-payment of utility bills may constitute a substantial interference
with a landlord’s lawful right, privilege, or interest (see for example
SWL-81313-15). Unpaid water arrears
may form a statutory lien on the Landlord’s freehold estate, and accordingly
can encumber the Landlord’s lawful title.
 
7.    
I
therefore find that this conduct
substantially interferes with a lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord.
 
8.     The Landlord advises that it is seeking an eviction
order or alternatively an order that the Tenants pay water bills for a period
of one year following the date of this order, with section 78 provisions to attach in the event of non-compliance by the Tenants.
I consider the requested
conditional order an appropriate alternative to eviction.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall pay all water bills in accordance with the terms of their lease for a
period of six months from the date of this order.
 
2.     If the Tenants breach
the provisions contained in paragraph 1
of this order, the Landlord
may apply under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, without notice to the
Tenants, for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants. The Landlord must make any such
application no later than thirty days after any such breach of the provisions
contained in paragraph 1 of this order.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.




 
 
 
4.    
If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before
March 3, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 4, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
 
 
February 3, 2022 Date Issued
 
South West-RO
150 Dufferin Avenue, Suite 400, 4th Floor
London ON N6A5N6
