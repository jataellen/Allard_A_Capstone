Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-26027-22
 
 



In the
  matter of:


416, 40 OAK STREET TORONTO ON M5A2C6


 




Between:


Fred Victor
  Centre


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Ezechinyere Nwosu


Tenant



 
 
 
Fred Victor Centre (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ezechinyere
Nwosu (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the
Tenant owes because the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board
on September 22, 2021 with respect to application TSL-22462-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenant
failed to pay $500.00 towards
the arrears, on or before January 1, 2022. The Tenant failed to pay the lawful
monthly rent in full, on or before January 1, 2022.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order
required the Tenant
to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $2,486.00 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order TSL-22462-21. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $986.00 and that amount is
included in this order. As a result, the previous order TSL-22462-21 is
cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from January 01, 2022 to January 31, 2022.




File Number: TSL-26027-22
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order TSL-22462-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 8, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
pay to the Landlord $1,386.00*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 28, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$34.52 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 29, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 8, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
February 9, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 8, 2022, then starting
February 9, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 9, 2022.

The tenant
has until February
7, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by February 7, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on August 9, 2022 if the order
has not been filed on or before
this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
