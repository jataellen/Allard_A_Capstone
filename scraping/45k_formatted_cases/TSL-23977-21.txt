Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-23977-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


1501, 33 ISABELLA STREET TORONTO ON M4Y2P7


 




Between:


Salford Investments Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Wade Hastings


Tenant



 
 
 
Salford Investments Ltd. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Wade
Hastings (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit
or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex
has wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage; and because the
Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on February
15, 2022. The Landlord’s
representative Bryan Rubin, and the Tenant, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord alleges
the Tenant kicked
the elevator door and as a result the Landlord incurred costs to have the door
repaired.
 
2.     The Tenant acknowledges that he kicked the door but
disputes that the door was damaged by him to the point it required the Landlord to pay to have the door repaired.
 
3.     The Landlord submitted
a video of the incident
which I reviewed at the hearing as well as the invoice for the repair.
 
4.     The Landlord’s employee, Michaela Viedas, testified
that the computer system that monitors the elevator shows when the damage was
done, that the people who did the repair showed her the damage
to the rollers they changed,
and that they informed her the
door was not sitting properly on the track due to the Tenant kicking the door.




File Number: TSL-23977-21
 
5.    
The Landlord’s building superintendent also testified that the door was not sitting properly on the track after it was
kicked.
 
6.     I find, on a balance
of probabilities, that the Tenant
caused damage to the door by kicking the door and that the
Landlord incurred costs of
$1,096.10 to repair the door. There is
no evidence there were any issues with the door before the Tenant
kicked. There is no reasonable
explanation why the Landlord would have paid to have the door repaired if there
wasn’t an issue with the door after it was kicked.
 
7.     The door was kicked by the Tenant out of frustration
because all of the elevators were being used by maintenance workers
when he was trying to get to his 15th floor unit. The workers continued to engage with the
Tenant and not allow the door to the elevator to close. This contributing factor leads me to conclude that relief from
eviction is appropriate pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$1,096.10, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage.
 
2.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     The Landlord has the right
to collect the full amount
at any time.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing on or before March 6, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 7, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
