  matter of:


BASEMENT, 687 UPPER JAMES

Between:


Samson Gill


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Ashley Marquard


Tenant



 
 
 
Samson Gill (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ashley Marquard (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 18, 2022. Only the Landlord
attended the hearing. As of 1:54 p.m., the Tenant was not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from May 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021.
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective September 13, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on December
3, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,450.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,450.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from March 13, 2021 to September 13, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of December 3, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.




File Number: SOL-25151-21
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $4,410.53*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to December
3, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 4, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 5, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
