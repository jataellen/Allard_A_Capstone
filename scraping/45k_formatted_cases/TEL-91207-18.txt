Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-91207-18
 











 
 
 

A.P.M. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict S.W. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
A.P.M.(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict S.W.(the 'Tenant') because he has been
persistently late in paying his rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation
for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on July 17,
2018.
 
Only the Landlord’s
representative, C.L., attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 application:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent he was required to pay for the period from January 1, 2018 to July
31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective April 25, 2018.
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $850.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by
the Landlord.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 1, 2014 to April 25, 2018.
4.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
L2
application
5.     
The Tenant has persistently
failed to pay the rent on the date it was due. The Landlord provided a ledger
sheet at the hearing which confirms that the Tenant has paid rent late 12 of 12
times from June 2017 to May 2018.
 
It is ordered that:
 
L1 application
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before July 28,
2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $2,253.05*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to July 17, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $29.39 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
July 18, 2018 to the date he moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before July 28, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from July 29,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before July 28, 2018, then starting July 29, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 29, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before July 28,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $3,248.48** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after July 29, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
L2 application
10.  
If the Tenant voids the
eviction order for non-payment of rent pursuant to paragraph 8 or 9 above then
the Tenant shall pay to the Landlord new rent on time and in full on the 1st
of the month for the period commencing August 1, 2018 to July 31, 2019. 
11.  
If the Tenant fails to make
any one of the payments in accordance with paragraph 10 of this order the
Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to the Board pursuant to
section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenants and requiring that the Tenants pay any new arrears, NSF fees and
related charges that became owing after July 31, 2018.
