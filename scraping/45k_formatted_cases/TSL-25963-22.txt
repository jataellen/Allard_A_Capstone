Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-25963-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


APT #1,
426 HORNER AVENUE TORONTO ON M8W2B1


 




Between:


Rose Saldutto


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Tammy Kennedy


Tenant



 
 
 
On December 30, 2021, Rose
Saldutto (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tammy Kennedy (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant entered
into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord and the Tenant signed an agreement to terminate the tenancy as of
January 23, 2022.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 30, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 30, 2022, then starting January
31, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.




File Number: TSL-25963-22
 
 
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 31, 2022.

The tenant has until January 29, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to
set aside the order under
s. 77(6) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 29, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on July 31, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction
where the rental unit is located.
