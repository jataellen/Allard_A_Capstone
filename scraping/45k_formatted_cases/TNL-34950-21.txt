Paramalingam Nithiyananthan (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Evan Price (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 17, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord’s Agent M.
Nithiyananthan attended the hearing. As of 10:46 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
September 1, 2021 to November 26, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination.
 
2.    
The Tenant vacated the rental unit
on November 26, 2021. The Tenant was in possession
of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,450.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant has made no payments
of rent since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $500.00
from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 1, 2021 to September 27, 2021.

for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before
