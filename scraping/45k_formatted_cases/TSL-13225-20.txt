Order under Section 69
and 30 of the
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-13225-20
 











 
 
 

V S (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict W E (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on March 2,
2020.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the
Tenant was required to pay for the period from October 1, 2019 to March 31,
2020.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective December 10, 2019.
2.     
The Tenant agreed that he owed the outstanding
amount of rent claimed by the Landlord.
3.     
The Tenant requested that his tenancy be
preserved and requested that the Board order a payment plan for the repayment
of the arrears of rent. The Tenant testified that he was unemployed from June
2019 to February 19, 2020 and fell behind in his rent. He testified that he is
now back to work on a part-time basis and can afford to pay his rent as it
becomes due.
4.     
The Tenant testified that his current income is approximately
$1000.00 per month and his monthly expenses are $615.00.
5.     
The Landlord requested that the Board deny the
Tenant’s proposal for a payment plan as the arrears are substantial and the
Tenant’s income is insufficient to cover his monthly rent, bills and the repayment
of the arrears of rent. 
6.     
On the basis of the evidence before the Board, I
find that the Tenant’s income would not be sufficient to allow for the
repayment of the arrears of rent and the rent as it became due; the Tenant’s
rent is $608.73, and his current expenses were stated as $615.00 per month. The
Tenant’s request for a payment plan is denied. The Tenant will have the
opportunity to avail himself to the voiding provisions of the order to preserve
his tenancy. 
Section 82 Claim
7.     
Pursuant to section 82 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’), the Tenant raised the following
issues at the hearing: the Landlord’s alleged failure
to meet the Landlord’s maintenance obligations under the Act or failure to
comply with health, safety, housing or maintenance standards.
8.     
Subsection 20(1) of the Act states:
A
landlord is responsible for providing and maintaining a residential complex,
including the rental units in it, in a good state of repair and fit for
habitation and for complying with health, safety, housing and maintenance
standards.
9.     
The Tenant alleged that the following
maintenance and repair issues were outstanding since December 31, 2018 (unless
otherwise indicated below), and that he had advised the Landlord of the
outstanding issues in emails dated December 31, 2018, August 26, 2019, and
September 30, 2019 (exhibit 2):
a.    
The door bell did not work and was still
dysfunctional at the time of the hearing; 
b.    
Six tiles on the bathroom floor were loose or
broken;
c.     
Lights on the exterior of the unit are off the
majority of the time;
d.    
Bathtub taps were leaking;
e.    
Exhaust fan was not operational and would not
turn on;
f.      
One light fixtures/socket in the washroom was
not operational and would not turn on;
g.    
The smoke detector in the hallway passage
between the rental unit and the other units in the building was not been
operational from August of 2019 onwards and was at some point completely
removed;
h.    
Pest infestation was not been adequately dealt
with; and
i.      
The heating was not turned on in accordance with
the Act.
10.   The Tenant also testified that on December 27, 2018 there was a
radiator leak in the apartment above his, which caused water to flow into his
unit and damage his sheets, books and property.
11.  
Based on the evidence of the Tenant, I find that
the Tenant failed to provide sufficient particulars regarding the heat in the
rental unit, and pests and pest control issues to meet the burden of proof to
prove his claim. These portions of the claim will be dismissed.
          Limitation
Period for Tenant’s Claims
12.  
Pursuant to subsection 29(2) of the Act, “no
application may be made under subsection (1) more than one year after the day
the alleged conduct giving rise to the application occurred”.  
13.  
As the Tenant’s claim was initially made before
the Board on March 2, 2020, on the basis of subsection 29(2) of the Act, I
cannot consider maintenance and repair issues alleged to have occurred prior to
March 1, 2018.
14.  
Additionally, on the basis of the Divisional
Court’s decision in the case of Toronto Community Housing Corporation v.
Vlahovich, [2010] O.J. No. 1463, I find that a tenant’s request for an
abatement of rent may extend no further back than one year from the date the claims
were raised before the Board.
15.  
As the radiator leak causing damage to the
Tenant’s property fell outside of the limitation period, that portion of the
claim for lost or damaged property will be dismissed. 
Analysis
of the Maintenance and Repair Claims
16.  
The Tenant testified to the outstanding
maintenance and repair issues as listed in paragraph 6 above and confirmed that
they remained outstanding at the time of the hearing. The Tenant requested an
abatement of rent in the amount of 8% to 10% of his rent.
17.  
The Landlord testified that the Tenant never
advised him that he was refusing to pay rent due to outstanding maintenance and
repair issues. The Landlord testified that the pest control treatments could
not be adequately completed as the Tenant had refused access to the rental unit
and had refused to allow the treatments to occur. The Landlord testified that
they attempted to deal with the pest infestation and they were forced to bring
an application against the Tenant in the past year because of hoarding and the
infestation in the rental unit. 
18.  
On the basis of the evidence before the Board, I
find that the Tenant did not meet the burden of proof to demonstrate on a
balance of probabilities that the Landlord failed to address the pest
infestation issue as there was evidence to the contrary.
19.  
The testimony of the Tenant regarding the
balance of the maintenance and repair issues listed in paragraph 6 (a) to (g) were
largely uncontested by the Landlord. On the basis of the evidence before the
Board, I find on the balance of probabilities that Landlord failed to meet the
Landlord’s obligations under subsection 20(1) of the Act to maintain the
residential complex and failed to comply with maintenance standards in regard
to the items in paragraph 6(a) to (g). 
20.  
Due to the Landlords’ failure to comply with
subsection 20(1) of the Act, the Tenant is entitled to an abatement of rent.
21.  
An abatement of rent is a contractual remedy on
the principle that if you are paying 100% of the rent then you should receive
100% of what you are paying for and if you do not receive that, then a tenant
should be entitled to an abatement for the difference in value. 
22.  
In determining the amount of entitlement for an
abatement of rent, I am required to consider the impact of disrepair on the
Tenant, from March 1, 2018 onwards. Based on the evidence of the Tenant I find
that the Tenant was impacted by the numerous outstanding maintenance issues in
the rental unit and is entitled to 8% abatement of rent in the amount of
$584.40.
Set-Off of amounts owing between the parties
23.  
The Divisional Court in Marineland of Canada
Inc. v. Olsen, 2011 ONSC 6522, has indicated that when the Board is aware
of situations where there are two applications involving the same parties, it
should be made clear to the parties that any amount owed to one party under a
Board order is to be set off against monies awarded to the opposing party. As
the Tenant has been awarded monies with respect to their section 82 claim, that
amount shall be set off against the arrears of rent the Tenant owes the
Landlord in the application.
24.  
The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $608.73
from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
25.  
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenant for the period from January 1, 2019 to December 10, 2019.
26.  
I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until March 31, 2020 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of
the Act as the Tenant has a last month’s rent on deposit and testified that he
would require time to find alternative housing.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out
below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The
Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before March 31, 2020.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,014.31*
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to March 9, 2020,
less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit, and less
the abatement of rent the Landlord owes the Tenant in the amount of $584.40
($2,598.71 arrears - $584.40 abatement).
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $20.01
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting March 10, 2020 to the
date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before March 20, 2020, the Tenant will start to owe
interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from March 21, 2020 at 3.00%
annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated on or before March 31,
2020, then starting April 1, 2020, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord, on or after April 1, 2020.
8.     
If, on or before March 20, 2020, the Tenant pays
the amount of $3,257.25 to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void ($3,841.65** arrears – 584.40 abatement).  This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenant could remain in the
unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after March 21, 2020 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to
make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
