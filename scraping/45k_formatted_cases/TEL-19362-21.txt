Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19362-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


20 TRIPP AVENUE BELLEVILLE ON K8P4N5


 




Between:


Hastings Local Housing
Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Naomi
Ndorley


Tenant



 
 
 
Hastings Local Housing Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict Naomi Ndorley (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 20, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Andrea Haggerty, attended the hearing. As of 2:18 p.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from August 1,
2021 to December 31, 2021. Because of
the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 25,
2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant
is in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $501.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant paid $450.00
after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord’s attempts at negotiating a repayment agreement
were unsuccessful.
 
6.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
7.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would not be unfair to postpone
the eviction until February 1, 2022

pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. Additional
time given to the Tenant to either secure
alternative accommodation or pay the outstanding amount.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before February 1, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $1,236.23*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 7, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay
to the Landlord $16.47 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 8, 2022 to the date the
Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 1, 2022, the
Tenant will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from February 2, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 1, 2022, then starting February
2, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord, on or after February 2, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$1,793.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022,
or
ii)             
$2,294.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 1, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after
February 2, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
