In the matter
of:


142 ELIZABETH CRESCENT DUNNVILLE ON N1A2P1


 




Between:


Haldimand Norfolk Housing Corp


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Marlene Hare


Tenant



 
 
Haldimand Norfolk Housing Corp
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Marlene Hare (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant,
another occupant of the rental
unit or someone the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or
another tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on December 15, 2021 at 2:14pm.
 
The Landlord’s agent, Tricia
Feist and the Tenant attended
the hearing. The Tenant
was assisted by Tenant Duty
Counsel Ian Aitken.
 
Also in attendance was the Tenant’s
support worker, Maya
Ingrao.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
By way of background, the rental
unit is a detached house with the front and back yard. This tenancy began
twelve years ago, and the Tenant resides in the rental unit with her four children
ages 19, 11, 10 and 9. The lawful monthly
rent is $725.00
and is due on the first of the month.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s L2 application is
based on a first N5 notice of termination served to the Tenant on November 6,
2020 with a termination date of November 30,
2020 alleging that the Tenant has failed to perform lawn maintenance in
accordance with the lease agreement and is improperly disposing her garbage by leaving it outside in the front yard.
 
3.     The N5 notice
of termination was served pursuant
to section 64 of the Act. Subsection 64(3) of the Act states:
 
(3) The notice of termination under
this section is void if the tenant,
within seven days after
receiving the notice, complies with the requirement referred to in




File Number: SOL-18790-20
 
clause (2) (c) or makes arrangements satisfactory to the landlord to comply with that requirement.
 
4.     Thus, the Tenant had seven days to remedy the situation by refraining from the behaviour being complained of in the N5
and restoring the residential premises to its original state. As the N5 notice of termination was served on November 6, 2020,
the voiding period was November 6 – 14, 2020.
 
5.     The problem with the
Landlord’s evidence was that it was insufficient to establish that the Tenant continued to
engage in the conduct listed N5 notice of termination during the voiding
period. I say this because there was no evidence before me that indicated the
Landlord attended the rental unit within the remedy period
or shortly thereafter to observe the state
of the residential complex.
 
6.     In fact, the evidence before the Board was the next inspection of the premises
took place on November 24,
2020. While the Landlord’s agent was certain that she attended the premises
shortly after the remedy period, it was unclear which date – whether it was
November 16 and 19, 2020
– and no corroborating
evidence was submitted in support
of this assertion.
 
7.     Therefore, I must find that the Tenant voided the N5
notice in accordance with section 64(3) of the Act. As the N5 notice of termination was voided, the Landlord’s L2 application
for eviction must be dismissed.
 
8.     Finally, a comment
with respect to the issue of lawn maintenance; in general, the Board’s
position is that this is usually the Landlord’s responsibility pursuant to
section 20 of the Act. Section 3 of the Act makes it clear that the Act applies
despite any agreement or waiver to the contrary. This ensures that landlords
and tenants can not contract out of their rights and obligations under the Act.
 
9.     This order contains
all of the reasons for my decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s L2 application is dismissed.
