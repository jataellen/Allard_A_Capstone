Order under Section
135
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNT-22822-19
 
 
 
 
 
AC and RN (the
'Tenants') applied for an order
determining that KJP and RC (the 'Landlords') have
collected or retained money illegally.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 21, 2021 at 9:42am.
 
Only the Tenant RN attended the hearing. The Landlords did not attend the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants filed a T1
Application on December 6, 2019, seeking the return of their deposit in the
amount of $900.00 because the Landlords did not allow them to move into the
rental unit.
 
2.    
The Tenant were
supposed to move into the rental unit on November 1, 2019. At the request of the Landlords, the Tenants paid a rental deposit via e-transfer in the amount of
$900.00 on September 6, 2019, the same day the rental
agreement was entered
into.
 
3.    
The Tenant testified
that on move-in day, he was advised by the Landlord that the rental unit was
not available, since the existing tenant had not vacated. The Tenant produced
text messages in support of the $900.00 rent deposit payment. Notwithstanding
the assurances by the Landlord, the rent deposit has not been returned.
 
4.    
I find the Landlords
collected a rent deposit from the Tenants in the amount of $900.00, that the
Landlords did not allow the Tenants to move into the rental unit and that the
Landlords failed to return the rent deposit. This is prohibited by the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').

It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlords
shall pay to the Tenants
the sum of $900.00. This amount represents
$900.00 collected for a rent
deposit.
 
2.    
The Landlords
shall also pay to the Tenants $50.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
The total amount the Landlords owe to the Tenants is $950.00.
 
4.    
If the Landlords do not
pay the Tenants the full amount owing by January 21, 2022, the Landlords will owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from January
22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the outstanding balance.
 
5.    
The Tenants
have the right,
at any time, to collect the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
