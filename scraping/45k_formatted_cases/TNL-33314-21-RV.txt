Review Order
 
Compass Charitable Foundation (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Kenton Ford (KF) and Tresha
Forrester (TF) (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was resolved by order TNL-33314-21 issued on October
21, 2021. On November 3,
2021, the Tenants requested a review of the order.
The request was heard by videoconference on January 21, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s legal representative B. Rubin and the Tenants
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Review
 
1.     The Tenants’ request
for a review is based on the ground of being not reasonably able to
participate in the proceedings.
 
2.     The hearing that gave rise to the order under
review took place on October
18, 2021. The Tenants did not attend.
 
3.     At the hearing the Tenant TF testified that the
Tenants received a notice for the hearing scheduled for October 18, 2021 but
that they also received a notice for a hearing to be held on November 8, 2021
and so they concluded that their hearing must have been rescheduled. The notice for the hearing
on November 8, 2021 had a different file number but, due to
a Board clerical error, this hearing was for an
application that was a duplicate




 
of the within application. The
materials sent with the notice were identical to those sent with the previous notice except for the file number and the hearing
date. The Tenants
are not legally trained and they are not represented. Their conclusion
that the hearing had been rescheduled is reasonable in the circumstances.
 
4.     Based on the above, at the hearing
I found that the Tenants
were not reasonably able to participate
in the proceedings and I granted the request for a review. The Landlord’s L1
application proceeded de novo (anew).
 
L1 application
 
5.     The Landlord submits that as of the review hearing
date, the Tenants are in arrears of rent in the amount of $16.00. The Landlord also claims the cost of the filing fee, $186.00. The Landlord claims a total of
$202.00.
 
6.     At the hearing
the Tenants submitted that they should
not owe anything because: (a) they
should not have to pay the fee because they keep up with their rent, and (b)
they should not owe the arrears
because these arrears arose out of a rent increase for which they did not
receive notice.
 
7.     At the hearing I reviewed the Landlord’s ledger with
the Tenants and confirmed that it accurately
records the dates and amounts
of payments made by the Tenants. The ledger
shows that as of July 6, 2021 (the date the application was filed), the Tenants
were in arrears of rent in the amount of one month’s rent. The ledger shows
that the Tenants brought their balance to zero in November 2021. The ledger
also shows that generally, one could characterize the Tenants’ payments as
keeping up with the rent, except that they did not pay rent for May 2021 until
November 2021. However, because the
Tenants were in arrears of rent when the application was filed it was
reasonable for the Landlord to file the application and incur the filing fee.
In these circumstances, the Landlord is entitled to be compensated by the
Tenants for the cost of the fee. The Tenants will therefore be ordered to pay
the fee.
 
8.     The Landlord’s legal representative submitted that the
Tenants’ rent was increased effective January 1, 2022 pursuant
to a notice of rent increase (NORI)
that was served
in accordance with the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'). The Landlord was not aware that this would be an issue at the hearing and so the Landlord had not filed a copy of the NORI or any documentation
showing that it was served. In order to address this issue expeditiously, I
directed the Landlord’s legal representative to file a copy of the NORI and any documentation of service as a post hearing submission and to provide
the Tenants with a copy as well.
 
9.     On January 24, 2022 the Landlord’s legal representative
filed a copy of a NORI addressed to the Tenants increasing the rent by the
guideline amount effective January 1,
2022. The notice is signed and is dated September 10, 2021. The Landlord’s
legal representative also filed a copy of a “serving list” indicating that the
NORI was served on the Tenants by placing it in their mailbox on September 21, 2021. These documents were given to the Tenants.




 
 
 
10.  Based on the NORI and the serving list, I find, on a
balance of probabilities, that the Landlord served the NORI for an increase
in rent effective January 1, 2022 in September
2021 by placing it in the
Tenants’ mailbox. This is proper
service (both the timing and the
method) and so I find that the NORI was properly served.
 
11.  I therefore find that the Tenants owe the Landlord
$16.00 in arrears.
Their rent increased by this amount (from $1,612.00
to $1,628.00) on January 1, 2022 and the Tenants paid
$1,612.00 for rent for January 2022.
 
12.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of
the Act, including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the
Landlord attempted to negotiate
a repayment agreement with the Tenant,
and find that it
would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
The amount owed is small and the
bulk of it is for the filing fee.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     Order TNL-33314-21 issued
on October 21, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the
following:
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to
the Landlord $16.00, which represents the amount of rent owing up to January 31, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     The total amount
owed by the Tenants is
$202.00.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing by February 28, 2022, the Tenants will owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
