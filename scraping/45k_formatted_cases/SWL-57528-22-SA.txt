In the matter
of:


11248 CULLODEN ROAD AYLMER ON N5H2R3


 




Between:


Peter Retsinas


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Alicia Wagner
  Henry Blatz


Tenants



 
 
Peter Retsinas (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Alicia Wagner and Henry
Blatz (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they
owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order
issued by the Board on July 30, 2021 with respect to
application SWL-49539-21.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved by order SWL-57528-22, issued on January 21, 2022.
The Tenants filed a motion to set aside order SWL-57528-22.
 
This motion was heard by videoconference on February 15,
2022.
 
The Landlord and the Tenants attended
the hearing. The Landlord
was represented by Olga
Humphreys. The Tenants were assisted by Tenant Duty Counsel, Nikisha Evans.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The first issue before the Board is whether
there was a breach of the
order SWL-49539- 21 as alleged by
the Landlord. At the hearing, the first-named Tenant agreed that there was a
breach; specifically, that the payment due for August 20, 2021 in the amount of
$1,836.00 was short by $36.00, which only came to her attention when she received
the Landlord’s L4 application in January 2022.
 
2.    
This means that the next
issue is whether
or not the Board is satisfied, having
regard to all the circumstances, that it would not be unfair
to set aside the eviction order.
(See: s. 78(11)(b) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').)
 
3.     The first-named Tenant testified that she breached the
order in August 2021 due to an honest mistake.
She confirmed making the following payments to the Landlord after the parties
attended the hearing on July 22, 2021: $4,650.00
on July 22, 2021 from the City
of St. Thomas; $480.00 in cash to the Landlord’s representative the same day;
on July 26, 2021, Salvation
Army had communicated to her that $1,000.00 had been sent to the Landlord; and $800.00 paid in August
by money order given to the Landlord’s




 
representative. According
to her, the order had been voided;
although the Tenant confirms she did not receive a
copy of the hearing order.
 
4.     The Tenant confirmed that the rent had not changed and was $1,130.00.
 
5.     Since the breach,
the Tenants have failed to pay the rent for the period
September 2021 – February
2022 because they received a N12 notice of termination from the Landlord;
later, the Tenant added that it was due to the lack of communication from the
Landlord.
 
6.     The Tenants prefer to maintain their tenancy as moving
under the circumstances with their young children
would be a great inconvenience to them. Furthermore, their youngest child
has special needs. The Tenants propose
a repayment plan whereby they would pay
the rent on time and $900.00 on each of the following dates: February 25, 2022;
March 11, 2022; March 18, 2022; March 25, 2022; April 1, 2022; April 8, 2022;
April 15, 2022
and April 22, 2022.
 
7.    
In the alternative, the Tenants seek a delay in the lifting of the stay to March 31, 2022 as
they have been looking for housing as well.
 
8.    
The Landlord opposed the Tenant ’s motion stating
that since the breach, the Tenant has continued to accrue arrears
($6,816.00) more than what was outstanding as of the hearing date ($5,836.00).
While the Tenants allege they could not communicate with the Landlord, there
was no barrier to their
communication with the Landlord’s representative, whose contact
information was on the previous order and who they did reach out to, to ask for
a copy of the August 20, 2021 money order.
 
9.     The Landlord seeks that the motion be denied, and the stay be lifted immediately as this
has caused great prejudice to the Landlord. No further submissions were made in
this regard.
 
ANALYSIS
 
10. 
Based on the
evidence before me, I find that the
Tenants breached the order in August 2021 by failing to pay $1,836.00 in full
on or before August 20, 2021 – this is not contested by the parties.
I also do not find that the order was voided at any point before
August 1, 2021.
 
11. 
The problem
with the Tenant’s
explanation for the reason they breached is that while the
Tenants confirm not receiving the order, the Tenants also confirmed that they
recorded the terms of their agreement separately from the hearing on July 22,
2021. The Tenants also confirm that the rent did
not change. So, it is unclear to me what
cause the Tenants to breach
aside from their own lack of due diligence in ensuring the correct amount was
paid on time.
 
12. 
Since then, the
Tenants have stopped paying rent due to receipt of a N12 notice of termination and a lack of communication from the Landlord. I am not aware of any section of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 or case law that relieves a tenant’s obligation to pay rent upon
receipt of a N12 notice of termination. It is also unclear why the Tenants




 
require communication from the Landlord
in order to pay their rent – as the Tenants’ own evidence was, the rent remains the
same.
 
13. 
Given all the
above, I find that it would be unfair to set aside the eviction order. The
evidence is insufficient to establish the Tenants’ default was reasonable.
Rather the evidence supports the conclusion that the Tenants
may not be able to afford the rental
unit.
 
14. 
With respect
to the timing of lifting
the stay, I find that given the length
of the tenancy and the
Tenants’ family circumstances, relief in the form of a delay of the lifting of
the stay is warranted. I find the requested delay to March 31, 2022 to be
reasonable.
 
15. This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The motion to set aside Order SWL-57528-22, issued on January
21, 2022 is denied.
 
2.     The stay of order SWL-57528-22 is lifted March
31, 2022.
