In the
  matter of:


2, 530 BRITANNIA AVENUE HAMILTON ON L8H1Z8


 




Between:


Chad Lines


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Sarah Welton


Tenant



 
 
Chad Lines (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sarah Welton
(the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for
the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation
for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on October 13, 2021.
 
The Landlord attended the
hearing with D. Lines and was represented by C. Beg. The Tenant was also present
and had the opportunity to speak with Tenant Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord in good faith requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation for their
father, Kevin Morrison.
 
2.     Filed with the Board and submitted into evidence is
the declaration of the Landlord’s father, Kevin Morrison, who indicates they
have a good faith and genuine intention to occupy the rental unit.
At the hearing, Kevin Morrison
testified to wanting
to reside in the
rental unit for more than one year and hopes to live in the unit indefinitely.
 
3.     The Landlord’s father testified that he currently
resides in a small apartment in Fergus and that he does not have a kitchen in his unit. He used to do handyman work and has since retired and does odd jobs
from time to time. He believes that moving to Hamilton would provide him with more
financial and family support.
 
4.     The Landlord paid the Tenant compensation equal to one month's rent on August
26, 2021 by e-transfer in the amount of $851.00.
 
5.     The Tenant was not opposed
to the Landlord’s application based on the Landlord’s father moving in, the Tenant was opposed
to having to move out quickly with no place to go.




 
Analysis
 
6.     The courts have provided much guidance to the Board
in interpreting the “good faith” requirement in the context of a
landlord seeking possession of a rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation by the landlord.
 
7.     In Feeny v. Noble, 1994 CanLII 10538 (ON SC),
19 O.R. (3d) 762, the Ontario Divisional Court considered this issue in the
context of subsection 103(1) under the Landlord and Tenant Act,
R.S.O. 1990, c. L.7, and held that “the test of good faith is a genuine
intention to occupy the premises and not the reasonableness of the
landlord’s proposal.”
 
8.    
In Salter v. Beljinac, 2001 CanLII 40231 (ON SCDC)
the Divisional Court
stated the following :
 
In my view, s.51(1) [now RTA
s.48(1)] charges the finder of fact with the task of determining whether the
landlord's professed intent to want to reclaim the unit for a family member is
genuine, that is, the notice to terminate the tenancy is made in good faith.
The alternative finding
of fact would be that the landlord
does not have a
genuine intent to reclaim the unit for the purpose of residential occupation by
a family member.
 
While it is relevant to the good
faith of the landlord's stated intention to determine the likelihood that the intended
family member will move into the unit, the Tribunal stops short of entering into an
analysis of the landlord's various options.
 
Once the landlord is acting in
good faith, then necessarily from the landlord's subjective perspective the
landlord requires the unit for the purpose of residential occupation by a family
member. That is sufficient to meet the s.51(1) standard.
The fact that the landlord might choose the particular unit to occupy
for economic reasons does not result in failing to meet the s.51(1) standard.
 
9.     More recently, in Fava v. Harrison, 2014 ONSC 3352 (CanLII) the Divisional Court,
in considering this issue in the context of the Act, found as follows:
 
We accept, as reflected in Salter,
supra, that the motives of the landlord in seeking possession of the property
are largely irrelevant and that the only issue is whether the landlord has a
genuine intent to reside in the property. However,
that does not mean that the Board cannot
consider the conduct
and the motives
of the landlord in order to draw inferences as to whether
the landlord desires,
in good faith, to occupy the property.
 
10.  Based on the evidence before
me I find that the Landlord has a genuine
intent to occupy the property for the purpose of
residential occupation by his father for at least one year.
 
11.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until February 28, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.




 
12.  The Tenant has resided in the rental
unit for about 17 years.
 
13.  The Tenant testified
that she has a modest income
while working a part time job and also is in receipt of public assistance. The Tenant indicated that she is having great difficulty finding
another affordable rental unit with her level income and requires some time to
move. The Tenant indicated that they
may be able to receive support from a community organization for emergency
housing, but she was not guaranteed housing.
The Tenant also supports her 16-year-old daughter
that goes to school within
blocks of the rental unit. The Tenant further indicated that she has no credit
and no co-signor which makes it even more difficult to find alternative
housing.
 
14.  At the hearing,
the Landlord was not opposed
to a 30-60 day delay on the eviction.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of February
28, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$2,881.94, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from October 1, 2021
to January 11, 2022 and less any payments the Tenant has paid to the Landlord
during this time.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $27.98 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from January 12, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
February 28, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 1, 2022.
