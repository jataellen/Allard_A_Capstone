Review Order
 
Amstar Pool I Lp (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict Michelle Brown (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved by order CEL-96787-20 issued on September 27, 2021. On October
20, 2021, the Landlord requested a review of the order.
The request was heard by videoconference on January 12, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord’s legal
representative S. McArthur attended the hearing. As of 9:44 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this
hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
Review
 
1.     The Landlord’s request
for a review is based on the ground of being not reasonably able to participate in the proceedings.
 
2.     The hearing that gave rise to the order under review took place on May 31, 2021. No representative of the Landlord was
present.
 
3.     In the review request the Landlord submits that its
representative, Mr. Anderson, had signed in to the hearings
in the teleconference in which
the hearing was conducted and was in the “opposed” hearing room
when this matter was called in the “unopposed” hearing room. The Landlord
submits that the Members presiding over the hearings
and




 
the Moderators directing participants from one room to another
were aware that Mr.
Anderson was present and representing the Landlord in this matter.
 
4.     At the review
hearing the Landlord’s legal representative confirmed that the facts
set out in the review request
are true and accurate.
 
5.     Based on the Landlord’s uncontested submissions, I
find that the Landlord was not reasonably able to participate in the proceedings. At the review
hearing I granted
the request for a review and the Landlord’s application proceeded de
novo.
 
L1 application
 
6.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October
27, 2020.
 
7.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
8.     The monthly rent is $1,897.50.
 
9.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,875.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
10.  Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 1, 2020 to October 27, 2020.
 
11.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order CEL-96787-20 issued
on September 27, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the
following:
 
2.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 28, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $23,430.31*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 17, 2022,
less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $63.95 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 18, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.




 
5.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 28, 2022, then starting
January 29, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 29, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before January 28, 2022, the Tenant pays the
amount of $26,318.50** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for
eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
29, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
