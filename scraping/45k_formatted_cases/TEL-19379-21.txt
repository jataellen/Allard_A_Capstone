Tenants




 


Jersey Hrncir Tyler Simmons


 



 
 
Loco Real Estate Investments Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tyler Simmons and Jersey Hrncir (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 20, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Lorrie McCullough, attended the hearing. As of 2:24 p.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
The application is amended
to show the rent for the months of
August 2021 and September 2021 were paid in full by the Tenants.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from July
1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 27,
2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,300.00.
 
4.    
The Tenants
paid $3,581.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord’s attempts at negotiating a repayment agreement were unsuccessful.
 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,300.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including
the impact of COVID-19 on the

parties and whether the
Landlord attempted to negotiate a
repayment agreement with the Tenants, and find that it would not be unfair
to postpone the eviction until
February 1, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b)
of the Act. Additional time given to the Tenant to either secure alternative
accommodation or pay the outstanding amount.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated. The
Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before February 1, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$650.26*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January 7,
2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $42.74 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 8, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 1, 2022, the
Tenants will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from February 2, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 1, 2022, then starting February
2, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction
may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
February 2, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and
continue the tenancy, the Tenants
must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$3,105.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$4,405.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 1, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this
paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after
February 2, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
