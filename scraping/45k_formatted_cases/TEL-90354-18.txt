C.R.S.L. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict J.H. and .PA.C. (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe. The Landlord also claimed
administration charges related to NSF cheques.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on May 16, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, I.M.,
the Landlord’s regional manager, J.N., second-named Tenant attended the hearing.

 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent they were required to pay for the period from February 1, 2017
to May 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective April 10, 2018.
2.     
The sole dispute in this
matter revolves around three money orders which the Tenant says she paid to the
Landlord. If the Tenant is correct, there is currently a credit to her account
of over $2,000.00. The Landlord says they did not receive these money orders.
If the Landlord is correct, the outstanding arrears for the period ending May
31, 2018, total $443.39.
3.     
The Tenant’s three money
orders are dated August 8, 2017, September 24, 2017, and October 20, 2017. The
Tenant says she went to the bank on the morning of the hearing and asked the bank
clerk to confirm that the Landlord had deposited all three money orders. The
Tenant says the clerk confirmed that all three were “cashed” and then wrote
“cashed” on the back of each money order along with the date each one had been
“cashed”. These dates are August 9, 2017, September 26, 2017, and October 25,
2017. 
4.     
For the following reasons, I
am not satisfied that the Tenant paid the three money orders to the Landlord. 
The Landlord’s Records
5.     
First, the Landlord is a
large corporate Landlord and keeps impeccable records of rental payments from
all its tenants. The Landlord regional manager, ‘JN’, provided extensive
testimony regarding the Landlord’s procedures when tenants pay their rent. JN
says, when the Landlord receives any payments including credit, debit, cash,
money orders or cheques, the Landlord photocopies the method of payment
immediately in the office. A staff member then takes the payment to the bank
within a day or two, obtains a deposit slip from the bank, obtains a deposit
stamp from the bank and staples all of these documents together. The staff also
have spreadsheets that record every day they visit the bank and what deposits
were made.  
6.     
JN had all of the relevant records with her at the hearing. JN says she
spoke with her staff on the morning of the hearing as well as the accounts
payable staff person at their head office. All of those people have confirmed
that they did not receive the three money orders and they did not visit the
bank on the days in question. JN also confirmed that she has no record of the
Landlord receiving the three money orders or depositing any of the three money
orders. 
7.     
According to the Landlord’s records, staff did not visit the bank on August
9th or October 25th when the Tenant says the Landlord
allegedly cashed two of her money orders. JN says her staff did visit the bank
on September 26th, but the money deposited was not from the rental
unit. 
8.     
Based on the evidence before me, I am not satisfied that the Tenant paid
the three money orders to the Landlord or that the Landlord deposited those
money orders on the dates in question. The Landlord’s records are consistent
and detailed. The Landlord has clear procedures regarding accepting and
depositing rent and I have no reason to believe they deviated from those
procedures. I find JN’s testimony to be both credible and reliable on this
issue. 
The Pattern of Payments
9.     
At the start of the hearing,
the Tenant testified about the financial difficulties she has been experiencing
for many months. The Tenant is the sole provider for herself and her young
child. She was in a car accident in May 2016 and was off work for 11 months.
When the Tenant returned to work, her mother passed away suddenly. Then in June
or July of 2017, the Tenant’s wages were garnished because of an outstanding
debt to the Canada Revenue Agency. The Tenant’s testimony is consistent with
the Landlord’s ledger of her rental payments. The Tenant typically pays her
rent late, and often in multiple installments. 
10.  
If what the Tenant says is
true, the three money orders would contradict her testimony regarding her
financial difficulties. All of the money orders are for hundreds of dollars and
they simply are not consistent with the pattern of payments contained in the
ledger. 
11.  
At the hearing, I explained
to the Tenant that, if she is correct and she paid to the Landlord the October
money order for $750.00, that would mean that she was actually paying the
Landlord more than she owed and would have a credit of a several hundred
dollars in October. The Tenant could not explain why, particularly while she
was experiencing financial hardship, she would intentionally pay the Landlord
more rent money than she owed. 
12.  
In addition, if what the
Tenant says is true and she paid to the Landlord these three money orders,
there is actually a current credit over well over $2,000.00. Given the Tenant’s
testimony regarding her financial hardship, I do not find this set of facts to
be plausible. 
13.  
In short, I find that the
three money orders contradict the Tenant’s testimony regarding her financial
hardship and it is not plausible that she paid the Landlord more than she owed
three separate times and now has a credit to her account of over $2,000.00. 
The Teller’s Notes
14.  
The final difficulty with
the Tenant’s testimony is the alleged note from the bank teller on the back of
each money order. I do not find it plausible that the bank teller would simply
write “cashed” and a date on the back of each money order without providing
more detail or supporting documentation. 
15.  
In addition, it is not clear
what “cashed” means with regards to these money orders. Only two parties are
permitted to deposit these money orders; the Tenant and the Landlord. By simply
writing “cashed” on the back of each one, it is not clear whether the Landlord
deposited the money order or whether the Tenant personally “cashed” the money
order and returned it to her own account. In short, the word “cashed” written
on the back does not confirm that the Landlord actually deposited these money
orders and, for these reasons, I am not satisfied on the balance of
probabilities that the Landlord deposited the three money orders. 
16.   On any application before the Board the person who alleges any
particular incident or event occurred has the burden of leading sufficient
evidence to establish that it is more likely than not that their version of
events is true. In this case that burden falls on the Tenant. Based on the
evidence before me, I find that the Tenant has led insufficient evidence to
establish that the Landlord deposited her three money orders. I therefore find
that the arrears are as per the Landlord’s hearing update sheet and total
$443.39. 
17.  
The only remaining issue
before me is whether it is fair in all the circumstances to grant relief from
eviction. 
18.  
The Landlord incurred
charges of $20.00 for administration charges related to cheques tendered by or
on behalf of the Tenants, which were returned NSF.
19.  
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,265.75 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
20.  
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2018 to April 10, 2018,
in the amount of $6.24.
21.  
The Tenants paid $1,250.00
after the application was filed.
22.  
The Landlord is seeking a
standard eviction order which means the Tenant would be instructed to pay the
arrears by June 5, 2018. The Tenant says she can pay all of the outstanding
arrears by June 1, 2018, as well as June’s rent. Based on the Tenant’s
testimony, and based on the fact that the standard order will give the Tenant
more time than she is requesting, I find that there is no reason to grant any
additional relief. 
23.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before June 5,
2018.
2.     
As of the date of this
order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent, compensation, and any unpaid charges
related to NSF cheques  the Landlord is entitled to by $1,067.26*.
3.     
However, the Landlord is
authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the Landlord owes
the Tenants:
$44.33 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting May 26, 2018
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit, and
$175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
4.     
The Landlord or the Tenants
shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
5.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 5, 2018, then starting June 6, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
6.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 6, 2018.
7.     
If the Tenants wish to void
this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust:
i)        $638.39 if the payment is made on or before May 31, 2018, or
ii)       $1,986.80 if the payment is made on or before June 5, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after June 6, 2018
but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
