Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006











 
 

YM (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict SB (the 'Tenant') because:
 
(a)   the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (L1 application);
(b)  The Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the
Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises;
(c) 
The Tenant has used
the rental unit or the residential complex in a manner that is inconsistent
with use as a residential premises and that has caused or can be expected to
cause significant damage; and because 
(d) 
The Tenant, another occupant
of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex
has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord in a residential complex that has three
or fewer residential units; and because 
(e)  The Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit
or a person the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has seriously
impaired the safety of any person (L2 application)
 
The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring
the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage. 
 
The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination
date.
 
The applications were heard in Mississauga on February
15, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
            L1 application
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from December 4, 2017
to March 3, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective January 25, 2018.
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,000.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from November 5, 2017 to January 25,
2018.
4.     
The Tenant wants to vacate
in 30-60 days. She has filed T2 and T6 applications (CET-73552-18) against the
Landlord that have been scheduled for April 10, 2018. 
5.     
The Tenant was hoping for
compensation from the Landlord to help her vacate earlier.
6.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
L2 application
Damage
7.     
The Landlord claimed in his
application that the Tenant caused damage to the rental unit. However during
the hearing the Landlord did not address any of the claimed damages claimed,
therefore I cannot make an award for damages.
Substantial
interference
8.     
The Landlord claimed the
Tenant substantially interfered with his reasonable enjoyment because if his child
ran upstairs, the Tenant would make noise complaints and bang on the roof. One
such incident occurred on December 15, 2017, after a heavy snowstorm. The
Landlord turned on the vacuum cleaner and the Tenant came upstairs banging on
the door shouting and yelling about the noise from the vacuum. 
9.     
The Landlord also stated the
Tenant smoked marijuana in the rental unit and this affected the Landlord’s 2
year old child.
10.  
The Landlord also stated
that the Tenant and her guest made racial slurs at the Landlord on an
unspecified date.
11.  
The Tenant’s response was
that the Landlords child would run during the day from 9:00 am to 12:00 am,
after she had been told when she moved in that the child would not be home
during the day. The Tenant stated she works at night, and due to her health
concerns after an accident, she cannot go out in public during the daytime. In
response to the vacuuming incident in December 16, 2017, the Tenant stated she
had worked a shift from 3:00 am to 11:00 am and was awoken by a boom sound above
her, so she went upstairs and asked the Landlord to keep it down.
12.  
The Tenant denied smoking
marijuana in the rental unit and stated she used marijuana (TSL oils for
dietary purposes) in her cooking for medical reasons. The Tenant stated she is
on other medications as well. The Tenant further stated she communicated with
the Landlord’s wife on November 9 and she arranged to cook using marijuana elsewhere.
13.  
The Tenant denied making
racial slurs to the Landlord, and asserted that she is not hostile when talking
with the Landlord. The Tenant also responded that her Dad, when visiting would
get notes put on his parked car by the Landlord’s neighbour’s and that cause
her Dad to curse at the neighbours, to leave his car alone.
14.  
I find that on a balance of
probabilities the Tenant’s behaviour does not constitute substantial
interference with Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment. Both parties experience some
noise caused by the other. The Landlord lives in the upper level and the Tenant
lives in a basement of the house and some noise is to be expected because the
property was not likely constructed with such usage in mind. 
15.  
With respect to the
marijuana use, I find that on a balance of probabilities the Tenant used it for
cooking purposes.
16.  
With respect to the
allegation of racial slurs, on a balance of probabilities, I find the Tenant
did not make racial slurs to the Landlord. 
Serious
impairment of safety
17.  
The Landlord testified that
on November 18, 2018 the Tenant was using the oven as a heater in the rental
unit, and this was a fire hazard. The Landlord further stated that he found
that the fire detector had been disabled during a fire inspection on January
14, 2018. 
18.  
The Tenant responded stating
there was no independent heating in the basement unit and the centralized heating
for the house comes into the basement unit. The Tenant stated that the left
side electrical panel was blown by the microwave (as she informed the
Landlord’s electrician) so she was unable use a separate space heater .The
Tenant stated she  leaves the stove on while she is awake. The Tenant let the
fire inspector know when he came on January 9, 2018 that she was using the
stove as a heater, and he responded that if there was no independent heating
source he didn’t know what to tell her.
19.  
The Tenant also stated the
fire detector fell off on its own and she and the fire inspector watched it
fall on January 9, 2018. 
18.  
While Tenant left her stove on for heating purposes due to the lack of
sufficient heat in the basement, I am satisfied that this only occurred she was
awake and had informed the fire inspector. I also find that on a balance of
probabilities that the fire detector was defective there was no evidence
submitted of any actual serious impairment of safety. 
19.  
I therefore find that the
Landlord has not established that the Tenant has seriously impaired the safety
of the Landlord or other persons in the residential complex.
20.  
The Landlord is directed to
fix the electrical panel on or before March 4, 2018, and once the electrical
panel is fixed the Tenant is not to use the oven as a heating source.
 
It is ordered that:
 
            L1 application
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before March 4,
2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $1,606.96*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to February 21, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes
on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $32.88 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
February 22, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March 4, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from March 5,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 4, 2018, then starting March 5, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 5, 2018.
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $3,190.00 if the payment is made on or before March 3, 2018, or
ii)       $4,190.00 if the payment is made on or before March 4, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March 5, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
L2 application
10.  
The L2 application is
dismissed.
