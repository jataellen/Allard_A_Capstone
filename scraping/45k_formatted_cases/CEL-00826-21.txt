Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-00826-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


BASEMENT APT, 270 JOHN STREET
STREET STAYNER ON L0M1S0


 




Between:


Sarah Phillips Douglas A Phillips


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Leonard Sheffield


Tenant



 
 
 
Sarah Phillips
and Douglas A Phillips (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Leonard Sheffield (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted
in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlords in a residential complex that has three or fewer residential
units.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 4, 2021.
The Landlords and the Tenant attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlords served the Tenant with a Form N7, with a notice
of termination date of
June 21, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlords brought this
application, on the basis the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or
someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlords in a residential complex that has three or fewer residential units
 
Substantial Interference
 
3.     I do not find on a balance of probabilities that the
Tenant has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlords.
 
4.    
The Landlords live in the upstairs
unit, while the Tenant lives in the basement unit.
 
5.     The Landlord Sarah Phillips (“SP”) testified that the
Tenant verbally harassed the Landlord on April 13, 2021 and June 11, 2021 by shaking
his fist at the Landlord
and




File Number: CEL-00826-21
 
calling her an
“idiot”. The Landlord denies shaking
his fist and admits only to stating the Landlord was “acting like an idiot”. While it is unfortunate that the Tenant
would use language, I do not find that this one comment rises to the level of
severity to constitute substantial interference so as to warrant
eviction.
 
6.    
The Landlord’s noise allegation is
that the Tenant frequently talks loudly and plays loud music at night. The Landlords’ Form N7 merely states the
sound occurred from “04/2021-Present”.
The Tenant states he is mindful of complying with applicable noise bylaws and has reminded
his guests that there are others living upstairs.
The onus in this
type of application rests with the Landlord. Given the lack of particulars as to frequency or intensity of the noise, I do not find
that this burden has been met.
 
7.     SP also testified that the Landlord’s guests have
engaged in smoking cannabis and cigarette usage in the rental unit contrary to
the lease agreement. SP testified
that she has young children and that her family is feeling the physical
effects. While she admits she has
never seen the Tenant or his guests smoking, she says she smells it often. The Landlord’s Form N7 states the smoking
occurred from “10/01/2021-Present” but did not point to any specific
days where the smoking
is alleged to have occurred or the smell was
particularly bothersome. The Tenant
admits there have been 2 occasions where people have smoked in the rental unit. In light of the Tenant’s unequivocal
denial of anything more than the 2 occasions and given the lack of particulars
provided by the Landlord as to date
of occurrence or impact upon the Landlord and her family, I find the Tenant’s
testimony more believable. I do not
find that the two events of smoking, as admitted by the Tenant, rise to the
level of substantial interference in this case.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlords' application is dismissed.
