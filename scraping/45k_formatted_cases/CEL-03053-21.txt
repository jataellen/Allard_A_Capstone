Capreit Limited Partnership (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ritenella Williamson (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 24, 2022. Only the Landlord’s representative, Jason Paine, attended
the hearing. As of 10:16 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this
hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
July 1, 2019 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
27, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent is $1,261.96.
 
4.     The Tenant paid all arrears
for the period
ending January 31, 2022 after the application was
filed.
 
5.     The only amount
outstanding is part of the Landlord's cost of filing
the application. As a
result, the order will be limited to costs only and not eviction.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $173.33
for the cost of filing the application.
