Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24447-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


68 STEVENSON STREET SOUTH GUELPH
  ON N1E5N4


 




Between:


Balbir Hira


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Donna Irene Mceachern Lucas James Rivers


Tenants



 
 
 
Balbir Hira
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Lucas
James Rivers and Donna Irene Mceachern (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord
requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard via
videoconference on January
5, 2022. The Landlord, the Landlord’s
legal representative, T. Kelly, and the Tenants attended the hearing. The
Landlord’s witness, H. Hira (HH), also attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenants because the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The termination date in the
N12 is October 31, 2021. In the notice, the
Landlord indicated that he was seeking to terminate the tenancy for his
parent’s own use.
 
2.    
The lawful monthly rent is $1,850.00.
 
3.     Submitted into evidence
was correspondence delivered to the Tenants
on August 30, 2021.
The correspondence states that October 2021 rent would be credited to the
Tenants in contemplation of the N12 notice. I find that the waiver of rent for
October 2021 meets the requirement of
compensation pursuant to section
48.1 and section 55.1 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).
 
4.     The Landlord filed a Declaration dated December 15, 2021 from HH, the Landlord’s mother. It states that she in good faith personally requires the rental
unit for a period of at least one
year.




 
 
 
 
Good Faith
 
5.     The only remaining issue to be determined is whether
the Landlord’s mother requires the unit in good faith.
 
6.     The Landlord’s mother
testified that she presently resides
with her son in his home. She is
85 years old and had two knee replacements, so she has difficulty getting up
the stairs. She wants to reside in the rental unit as the bathroom
and bedroom are on the same floor. She further testified she will live
there full time and for a period of at least one year.
 
7.     The Landlord testified to his mother’s
surgery and that she presently resides with him. The
bathroom is not on the same floor as the bedroom
and she needs to take sixteen steps
on the stairs to get between them. The
Landlord also submitted that
the arrears to the end of January
2022 are $12,800.00 and an L1 application had been filed in this regard.
 
8.     The Tenant, D. Mceachern (DM), disputed that the
Landlord is terminating this tenancy in good faith because he had previously served
them with a notice for arrears and there are outstanding repairs that he does not address. For example, the windows do not lock. When
asked whether they had filed a Tenant application, DM stated that they had not.
 
9.     I do not find that the Landlord served this N12 notice
on the Tenants because of their arrears. The Landlord’s uncontested evidence
was that he had filed an L1 application for the Tenants’ arrears. As the Landlord
pursued arrears through
the proper application, I do not find that the
pursuit of arrears to be the reason for the service of this N12 notice.
 
10.  Regarding the Tenants’
allegation that the Landlord was seeking to terminate
the tenancy because of their
maintenance issues, I do not find that this is the case. If the notice and
application were retaliatory then one would expect a temporal connection between the time the
Tenants filed an application and this application. However, it was the Tenants’
evidence that they had not filed any application regarding their
maintenance issues. As such, I do not find that this N12 application is
retaliatory.
 
11.  I am therefore satisfied on the balance of probabilities, that the Landlord’s
mother in good faith requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation and she
genuinely intends to reside in the rental unit and for a period of one year.
 
Relief from Eviction
 
12.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
13.  DM testified that they had submitted over one
hundred rental applications since July 2021 and have been unsuccessful in finding
a unit. The Tenants have four young children residing with them.




 
 
 
14.  The Landlord submitted that the Landlord’s mother has
difficulty with navigating the stairs after
her surgery and therefore, requires
the unit as soon as possible. Further,
the Tenants are in
substantial arrears which is negatively impacting this small Landlord.
 
15.  While the Tenants’
evidence was that they have young children
residing with them, I find it
would be unfair to grant relief from
eviction. The Landlord’s mother has been waiting for a long period
of time to gain access
to the unit where she can comfortably move between the bedroom and bathroom. Further,
as the Tenants’ evidence was that they have been looking
for a unit since July 2021, it is unclear that the Tenants would benefit from
additional time to look for another unit.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated, as of January
29, 2022. The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before January 29, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$14,547.06, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from November 1, 2021
to January 18, 2022 (less any rent paid by the Tenants for this
period).
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the
Landlord $184.14 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from January
19, 2022 to the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before January
29, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January
30, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated on or
before January 29, 2022, then starting January 30, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord on or after January 30, 2022.
