Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-35114-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


BASEMENT, 26 CORNER
BROOK CRESCENT WOODBRIDGE
  ON L4H0J7


 




Between:


Chuan Shen


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


James McCracken


Tenant



 
 
 
 
Chuan Shen (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict James McCracken (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
24, 2022. The Landlord and the
Tenant attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
May 1, 2020 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October
5, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,635.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,600.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the




 
Tenant, and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. In particular, I considered that the
Tenant said that he did not have the means to pay the regular rent and the
arrears and that he was not seeking to preserve the tenancy, but seeking delay of the eviction date. He said
that his nine-year-old child lived with him 35% of the time. He proposed a
significant delay in the eviction date but would not commit to paying the regular rent during the proposed period of delay, although
his income is almost $100,000 per year. l did not find it appropriate to grant
the Tenant's request for relief from eviction in the form of a delay in the
eviction date given the Tenant's significant financial means and his lack of regard for his financial
obligations with respect to
this tenancy.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 11, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $8,763.38*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
31, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $53.75
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
11, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 12, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 11, 2022, then starting
February 12, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 12, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$10,813.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$12,448.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 11, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.




 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 12, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
