MAIN FLOOR,
252 DOLPH STREET
N CAMBRIDGE ON N3H2A7


 




Between:


Irfan Gillani Sajed Karim Piero Ferraro


Landlords




 


and


 




 


Samantha Newell


Tenant



 
On January 6, 2022, Irfan
Gillani, Sajed Karim and Piero Ferraro (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Samantha
Newell (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have
the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant
owes because the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the
Board on September 16, 2021
with respect to application SWL-52824- 21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlords could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following conditions specified in the
order:
 
The Tenant failed
to pay to the Landlord
$500.00 on or before December
15, 2021 towards arrears of
rent.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order
required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlords are entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $5,036.00 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
SWL-52824-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $5,036.00
and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous
order SWL-52824-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant
has also failed to pay the full rent that
became owing for the period from October 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $950.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlords.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period from
September 11, 2020 to January 31,
2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SWL-52824-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 11, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $6,835.05*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to January 31, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on
the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $31.23
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 1, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing* on or before February 11, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 12,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 11, 2022, then starting
February 12, 2022, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after February 12, 2022.

The tenant has until February 10, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by February 10, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on August 12, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
