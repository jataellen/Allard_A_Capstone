File Number: SOL-24730-21



In the matter
of:


511, 263 ONTARIO
STREET MILTON ON L9T2T7


 




Between:


Brayco Management


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Wayne
Morton


Tenant



 
 
Brayco Management (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Wayne Morton (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 14, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Robert Heughan,
attended the hearing.
As of 1:59 p.m. the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective August
30, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $929.63.
4.    
The Tenant
paid $5,207.48 after
the application was filed.
5.    
The only amount outstanding is the Landlord's cost of filing
the application. As a result,
the order will be limited to costs only and not eviction.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
2.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the
full amount owing* on or before January 16, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
