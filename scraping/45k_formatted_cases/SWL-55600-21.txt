Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number: SWL-55600-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
126 WELLINGTON STREET N KITCHENER
  ON N2H3Y3


 




Between:


Cacoeli Living
Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Neena Louis


Tenant



 
 
Cacoeli Living Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Neena Louis (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 20, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Lisa Nadon,
attended the hearing. As of 2:00 p.m.,
the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective October 5, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     
As of January 31, 2022, the monthly rent for the unit is
$1458.22
 
4.     
The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,384.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 4, 2018
to January 1, 2022.
 
7.      I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord
attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant
and find that it
would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.

the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 12, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)  
$7,407.98 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022,
or
ii)  
$8,866.20 if the payment
is made on or before February 11, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate
deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 12, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
