On November 25, 2021, Sheldon Smith (the 'Landlord') applied in this L3 application for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Peter Snyder (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant entered into an agreement to
terminate the tenancy.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    The
Landlord and the Tenant signed
an N11 Agreement to End the Tenancy
form, with effective
termination date January 31, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 31, 2022.
 
2.       
Since the Landlord applied
for this order before the termination
date expired, the costs of the application filing fee will not be
imposed on the Tenant.
 
3.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022, then starting February
1, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.

the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 1, 2022.
