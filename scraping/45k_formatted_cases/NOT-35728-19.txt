Order under Sections 30 and 31
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOT-35728-19
 
 
 
 
KR (the 'Tenant') applied for an
order determining that RVPI , HD and JD (the 'Landlords') failed to meet the
Landlords' maintenance obligations under the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), that the Landlords
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or
residential complex by them and that the Landlords withheld or deliberately interfered
with the reasonable supply of a vital service that the Landlords are obligated
to supply under the tenancy agreement.
 
This application was heard on June 16, 2021 in VC75 and on July 22, 2021 in Passcode 215 965
491 VC 75. The Tenant
and the Tenant’s
representative, (‘AB-S’), attended the hearing on June 16, 2021 and
only the Tenant’s representative, AB-S, attended the hearing on July 22, 2021.
 
This application is one of 16
related tenant applications against the Landlords concerning the effective shut down of a mobile
home park and certain maintenance and repair issues
leading up to the time of the
effective shut down. The park was
known as RVP (the ‘Park’)
 
Refer to order NOT-33990-18-HR (the ‘Base Order’)
issued February 1, 2022, concurrently with this and the other 14 related individual Tenant
applications. That order sets out my
determinations on the liability of the Landlords pertaining to events
leading up to the Park’s closure and the availability of
remedies related to the closure itself.
 
The application under file number NOT-33990-18 was a
multi-tenant T2 application brought
on behalf of fifteen
tenants identified in Schedule 1 to that order (‘Park
Tenants’), seeking relief for
the discontinuance of power to the Park. A
separate T6 application and/or T2 application was brought by each of the
fifteen Park Tenants, seeking relief for the Landlords’ actions and inactions
pertaining to the Park’s water supply, the Park’s sewage system and the
effective closure of the Park. This application under file NOT-35728-19 is one
of those applications.




 
The hearing of issues common to
all of the applications, meaning common to the application under file number NOT-33990-18 and the fifteen
individual applications, proceeded
to completion on July 22,
2022 in Passcode 215 965 491 VC 75 following a number of earlier appearances.
The hearing of the Tenant’s individual issues under file number NOT-35728-19 proceeded on June
16, 2019. The procedural history is set out in the Base Order.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
As set out in the Base Order, I find that that:
 
a)    
The Landlords withheld or interfered with the provision
of electricity, a vital service;
 
b)     The Landlords failed
to repair or maintain the Park’s sewage
system, allowing problems with sewage discharges and
significant odours over a period that extends back prior to one year prior to
the Tenant’s application filing in March 2019;
 
c)      The Landlords failed to repair or maintain
the Park’s water system such that the supply
of potable water was compromised for roughly two weeks at the beginning of
March 2018 and throughout the period June through October 2018;
 
d)     The Landlords’ failures
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the units and the Park by the Tenants,
both prior to and after October 2018; and
 
e)     The above failures, combined with the Landlords’
decision to cease providing all services at the Park as of October
2018, attract various
remedies, some pertaining to events leading up to the October 2018 effective closure and
pertaining to events following that effective closure.
 
2.    The Tenant claims
for two classes
of remedies: first,
those attributable to the wrongdoing of the Landlords prior to the
Park’s effective closure in October 2018; and second; those attributable to the
closure.
 
3.    I find the following facts on the basis of the uncontroverted testimony of the Tenant
and, where indicated, my review of materials provided at Tab I of the Tenant’s
productions;
 
a)     The Tenant lived at the Park for many years
before he vacated
in November 2019, more than a year after the Park
effectively closed in October 2018;
 
b)     The Tenant paid rent of $240.07 per month at the Park until May 2018.
He paid no rent after May 2018;
 
c)     
The Tenant was not particularly affected
by the water problems at the Park until after the power was cut off and the Park
effectively closed a the end of October 2018;




 
d)    
The Tenant did most of the snow
removal at the Park following its closure. He
estimated that he spent roughly 8 hours each time he did the work, for a total of over 130 hours;
 
e)     The Tenant incurred
the following out of pocket
expenses during his stay at the Park
following the October 2018 closure:
 
(i)                
$431.35 for equipment to hook up his generator (refer receipts at Tab I-5 of the Tenant’s productions;
 
(ii)               
$422.28 for propane (refer receipts at Tab I-5 of the Tenant’s productions);
 
(iii)             
$33.80 for water;
 
(iv)             
$53.10 for a camping
toilet (refer receipt
at Tab I-5 of the Tenant’s
productions); and
 
(v)              
$7,348.07 for fuel (refer receipts
at Tab I-5 of the Tenants’ productions). The
Tenant had heated his home with oil prior to the shutdown of power at the Park. The oil furnace
could not function
without power so the
Tenant fuelled a generator to provide heat. He
did not have a wood stove; and
 
f)       The Tenant suffered
a loss of $20,000.00 in the value of his trailer.
 
First Type of Remedies
- for the Period Prior
to October 30 2018
 
4.   
For the first type of remedies, I
have considered compensation for events occurring between March 15, 2018, being one year prior to
when this application was filed, and the end of October 2018.
 
5.   
I find that the Tenant is entitled
to a rebate of $60.02, being 10% of the of the $240.07 monthly rent which they
paid at the Park for 2 ½ months period from mid-March 2018 (being one year
before the filing of the application) through May 2018 (after which the Tenant stopped
paying rent) for the impacts of the Landlords’ failure to maintain
or repair the sewage system.
 
Second Type of Remedies - Pursuant to the Park Closure
 
6.   
For the second type of remedies,
as set out in the Base Order, I find
the following:
 
a)    
The Tenant is not entitled to compensation for the loss of value of the mobile home;
 
b)     The Tenant is entitled to compensation for his
reasonable out of pocket expenses during his continued stay at the
Park;
 
c)     
The Tenant may be entitled to damages for interference with reasonable enjoyment.




 
7.   
The Tenant is entitled
to compensation for some, but not all, of his out of pocket expenses during his continued stay at the
Park, as follows:
 
(i)                
The Tenant is entitled to $940.53
for the costs which he incurred for hooking
up his generator ($431.35), purchasing propane ($422.28), purchasing water ($33.80) and purchasing a camping toilet ($53.10);
and
 
(ii)               
I find that the costs incurred by
the Tenant for fuel, which on the basis of the
receipts amounted to well over $1,000.00 in some months, are not fully compensable. I find that the Tenant failed to mitigate
his losses in this regard by failing to either locate other accommodation which
would have been significantly less costly or by purchasing a wood stove, as other of the Park Tenants
had done. I find that the Tenant should receive some
compensation but find that the amount should properly be limited to $1,000.00;
 
8.    I find that the Tenant is
not entitled to compensation for his time in
plowing the snow at the Park.
This is not an out of pocket expense.
I recognize that the Tenant put considerable effort into this work,
however, and have considered that fact in my finding with respect to damages
for interference with reasonable enjoyment.
 
9.   
I
find that the Tenant is entitled to damages for interference with reasonable enjoyment. It is unclear why the Tenant was unable to locate alternate
accommodation during a time when he was paying more than $1,000.00 per month for fuel for his generator at the
Park. Nonetheless, I find that it is likely that the Tenant suffered
difficulties during the time he stayed. I note, in particular, that he took on responsibility for the snow removal at the Park and devoted considerable time to
those efforts. I find that an award
of $1,500.00 in damages is appropriate in the circumstances.
 
 
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlords shall pay to the Tenant a total of $3,500.55, representing payment for the following:
 
a)     rent abatement of $60.02 for the impacts
of the problems with the sewage system;
 
b)     $940.53 for out of pocket
expenses (except fuel)
subsequent to October
2018;
 
c)      $1,000.00 for fuel expenses; and
 
d)     $1,500.00 for damages.
 
2.    
The Landlords shall pay the Tenant
the full amount
owing by March 31, 2022.




 
3.    
If the Landlords do not pay the
Tenant the full amount owing by March 31, 2022 the Landlords will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from April 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
