Donald Davies                                                                                                 Tenant
 
 
Huron Green Inc. (the 'Landlord')
applied in this L4 application for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Donald Davies (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant failed
to meet a condition
specified in the consent order issued by the Board on November 26, 2021 with
respect to L2 application SWL-44844-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the
Tenant did not meet certain
condition(s) specified in the consent order.
 
2.       
I find that the Tenant has not met
the following condition specified in the order: On or about December
15, 2021 and December 31, 2021, upon inspection it was observed that the unit was in
a state of uncleanliness and cluttered. This was a breach of the previous consent order.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 5, 2022 (standard 11 days from the issuance date of this
order).
 
2.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 5, 2022, then starting February
6, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
