Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-31918-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


407, 150 COLBORNE AVENUE RICHMOND HILL ON L4C2K1


 




Between:


Mike Skarpathiotakis


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Gerry
Prevost


Tenant



 
 
 
Mike Skarpathiotakis (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Gerry Prevost (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 8, 2021.
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
It is determined
that:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
March 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination.
 
2.    
The Tenant also owes the Landlord
$170.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    The total amount owing is $2,568.00($2,398.00 + $170.00).
 
4.    I have
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it
would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the conditions set
out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. The Tenant
undertook to pay all the arrears by November 30, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant has already brought
their rental account
to a zero balance, the Tenant
shall do so by January 31, 2022.The Tenant
shall pay the Landlord $2,584.00 as follows:




File Number: TNL-31918-21
 
2.    
If the Tenant fails to
comply with this order, the outstanding balance
of any arrears of rent and costs to be paid by the Tenant to
the Landlord pursuant to paragraph 1 of this order shall become immediately due
and owing and the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant apply to the Board
pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and
evicting the Tenant and requiring that the Tenant pay any new arrears, NSF
fees and related charges.
