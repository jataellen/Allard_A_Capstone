Review Order
 
 
Ann-Marie Defreitas and Taryn
Defreitas (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Joseph Chakkalackal (the 'Tenant') because
the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was resolved by order TEL-16746-21 issued on July 14, 2021
On August 12, 2021, the Landlord requested a review of the order.
The request was heard by videoconference on November 30, 2021.
 
The Landlords, the Landlords’ Representative Orly Kahane
Rapport, the Tenant and the Tenant’s Representative, Delaram Jafari
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord argues
that the Member made an error
in law by misinterpreted section 48
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') by assessing motive rather
than genuine intention of the Landlord
to occupy the rental unit for personal
occupation. In the Landlord’s
view the Member ought to have relied more on the medical evidence rather than
conduct related to past applications and argued the Member made unreasonable
findings on the material issue.
 
2.     On the basis of the submissions made in the request, I am not satisfied that there is a
serious error in the order or that a serious error occurred in the proceedings.

3.    
The review request is denied in accordance with Rule
26.9(c) of the Board’s Rules of
Procedure because the grounds for considering a review are not satisfied.
 
4.     There is nothing in the record or in the submissions
made in the request for review to support a determination that the Member
applied improper principles in assessing the evidence introduced or that there
was insufficient evidence before the Board to support its conclusions. I would not interfere
with the assessment of the medical evidence by the Member of first instance, who had the opportunity of observing and hearing the evidence
in its totality.
 
5.     The review considers whether reasonable findings of
fact were made on material issues based on the evidence presented at the
original hearing. I find the order sets
out very detailed reasons for the
determinations made by the Member and demonstrates that the Member turned her mind to both the
intention of the Landlord to occupy the rental unit and motive when she
considered the Landlord’s pattern of conduct. The Member also references the
case law in paragraph 15 and 16 of the order.
Member’s findings of fact are entitled to considerable deference, as
stated in Guideline 8 of the Board’s Interpretation Guidelines. The Member’s
reasonable determinations will not be interfered
with on review.
6.    
The Landlord’s Representative is different from the Representative at the first
hearing. A review is not an opportunity to reargue the case in the hopes
of a better outcome with a different Representative.
 
7.    
The Member is in the best position
to determine the facts, assess the credibility of the parties and give the appropriate weight
to the evidence before her. The request to review
the order is denied.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The request to review order TEL-16746-21 issued on
July 14, 2021 is denied.
The order is confirmed and
remains unchanged.
