1128618 B.C. Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jessica Chase and Ryan Johnston (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard by videoconference on January 6, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s Legal Representative, Daniel Abraham, attended the hearing. As of
3:01 p.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay
for the period from March 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective August 4, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
vacated the rental
unit on January 5, 2022. The Tenants were in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,479.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants have made no payments since the
application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of January
5, 2022, the date the Tenants returned
vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.

owing and compensation up to January 5, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.

Landlord the full amount owing*
on or before January 28, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at 2.00% annually
