Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-02794-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


25 NAPA VALLEY CRESCENT BRAMPTON ON L7A2X8


 




Between:


Jesan Real
Estate Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Anthy Koutsoukos Deena Koutsoukos John Koutsoukos Sean Doyle


Tenants



 
 
 
 
 
 
Jesan Real Estate Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Sean Doyle, Anthy Koutsoukos, Deena Koutsoukos and John Koutsoukos (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 10, 2022. The
Landlord’s Agent Masharef Hussan, the Landlord's Legal Representative, Pathik
Baxi and three
of the Tenants attended the hearing.
As of 12:43 p.m., the Tenant John Koutsoukos was not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2018 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective July 11, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful monthly rent is $2,515.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
 
5.    
The Tenants have made no payments
since the application was filed.




 
6.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenant and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until January 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. I
considered the Tenants' request for considerable delay with respect
to the eviction date based on there being 2 children under the age of 12 living in the rental
unit and I found it appropriate to give a modest delay to January 31, 2022. I did not find it appropriate to give
further delay given the amount of the arrears. I did not find it
appropriate to delay the eviction date based on their purported intention to
appeal the court decision regarding termination of their option to purchase agreement.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant
voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental
unit on or before January 31, 2022.
 
2.     As of January
18, 2022, the Tenants owe the Landlord
$102,211.40*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January 18,
2022. However, the Board is only authorized to order the Tenants to pay the maximum of its monetary
jurisdiction of
$35,000.00.  Therefore, the Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
the maximum amount of
$35,000.00.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay the Landlord $82.68 per day
for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 19, 2022 to the date
the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the costs of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the full amount owing*
on or before January 31, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 31, 2022,
then starting February
1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
February 1, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust the
amount of $103,316.00** by January 31, 2022. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants
could remain in the
unit. If this payment is not made in
full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.




 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after
February 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
