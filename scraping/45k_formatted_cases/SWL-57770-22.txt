Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57770-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


37, 235 SAGINAW PARKWAY CAMBRIDGE ON N1T1X4


 




Between:


Neil Puterman


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Claudette D Dwyer Glenn L Dwyer


Tenants



 
 
 
Neil Puterman (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Glenn L Dwyer and Claudette D Dwyer (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants entered
into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord and the Tenants
signed an agreement to terminate the tenancy as of
August 31, 2022.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before August 31, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
August 31, 2022, then starting
September 1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after September 1, 2022.
