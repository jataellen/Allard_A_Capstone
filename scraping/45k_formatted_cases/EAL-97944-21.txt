Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number: EAL-97944-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
708, 205 RIDEAU
STREET KINGSTON ON K7K7B1


 




Between:


Kingston and Frontenac Housing Corp.


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Raymond Chiasson


Tenant



 
 
Kingston Municipal Non Profit
Housing (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Raymond
Chiasson (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 18, 2022. Only the Landlord’s representative, Kelly Vallier,
attended the hearing. As of 2:10 p.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this
hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
July 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August
26, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $471.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.    
The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
6.    
The application is amended
to reflect the Landlord name as Kingston
and Frontenac Housing Corp.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would
be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 8, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$3,173.01*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 28, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $15.48 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 29, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before
February 8, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 9, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 8, 2022, then starting February 9, 2022,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 9, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$3,383.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022,
or
ii)             
$3,854.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 8, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 9, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
