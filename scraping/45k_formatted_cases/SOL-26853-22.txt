In the
  matter of:


506, 43 KING STREET FORT ERIE ON L2A3Z4


 




Between:


Fort Erie Municipal Non-profit Housing


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Michelle Edmunds


Tenant



 
 
 
Fort Erie Municipal Non-profit
Housing (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Michelle Edmunds (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay
the rent the Tenant owes because
the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on November 25, 2021
with respect to application SOL-21401-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following condition
specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $200.00 arrears
on or before January 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$4,024.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application
fee in Order SOL-21401-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $2,781.03
and that amount is included
in this order.
As a result, the previous order SOL-21401-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from February 1, 2022 to February 28, 2022.




File Number: SOL-26853-22
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SOL-21401-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 14, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
pay to the Landlord $2,823.24*. This amount represents the rent owing up to February 3, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $14.07 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 4, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 14, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
February 15, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 14, 2022, then starting February
15, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 15, 2022.

The tenant has until February 13, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by February 13, 2022
the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of
