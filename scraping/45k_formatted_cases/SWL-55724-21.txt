Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55724-21
 



In the matter
of:


12, 280 LORNE AVENUE KITCHENER ON N2M3Y9


 




Between:


CLV Group


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Robin McAllister Stephen Burgess


Tenants



 
 
CLV Group (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Robin McAllister and Stephen Burgess
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe. The Landlord also
claimed administration charges related to NSF cheques.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on January 20, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s Legal Representative,
Elena Jacob, attended the hearing. As of 11:25 a.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the
period from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective October 5, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord
incurred charges of $40.00 for administration charges
related to cheques tendered by or on behalf of the
Tenants, which were returned NSF.
 
3.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
4.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent for the unit increased
to $953.91.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $859.17 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from August
11, 2020 to October 5, 2021.
 
7.     The Tenants paid $3,839.11 after
the application was filed.




File Number: SWL-55724-21
 
8.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 11, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$1,037.68*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 31, 2022 and the total charges related to
NSF cheques tendered to the Landlord by
or on behalf of the Tenants, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $30.99 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 1, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
11, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 12, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 11, 2022, then starting
February 12, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 12, 2022.
 
8.     If
the Tenants wish to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenants must pay
to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$2,053.80 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$3,007.71 if the payment
is made on or before
February 11, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not
make full payment in
accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.

9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 12, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
