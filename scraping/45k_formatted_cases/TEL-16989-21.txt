Monika Persaud
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Bradley Fowler and Courtney Hooper (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe. The
Landlords also applied for an order requiring the Tenants to pay compensation for the money they should
have paid had they not misrepresented their income or the income of a member of
their family
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 11, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s
Legal Representative, Kimberley Covey, attended the hearing. As of 10:02 a.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
L2 Application:
 
1.     The Tenants vacated the rental unit on September 30,
2021, therefore the Landlord requested to withdraw the L2 application and the
Board granted the request.
 
L1 Application:
 
2.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2020 to August 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective March 31, 2021.
 
3.     The Tenants vacated the rental unit on September 30,
2021. The Tenants were in possession of the rental unit on the date the
application was filed.

The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
