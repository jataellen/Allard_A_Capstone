In the matter
of:


203, 135 JAMES
STREET CLINTON ON N0M1L0


 




Between:


Huron County
Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Edward Labreche


Tenant



 
 
 
Huron County
Housing Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Edward Labreche (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant or another
occupant of the rental unit has committed an illegal act or has carried out, or
permitted someone to carry out an illegal trade, business or occupation in the
rental unit or the residential complex. The Landlord also claimed compensation
for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This
application was heard via videoconference on January 17, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s legal agent, A. Stevenson, attended the hearing. As of 9:53 a.m.,
the Tenant was not present or represented although properly served with notice
of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant or another occupant
of the rental unit has committed an illegal act. The Tenant was served with an N6 Notice of
Termination on September 15, 2021.
 
2.     The N6 Notice alleges that the Tenant wilfully caused
damage to the residential complex and was subsequently charged with mischief.
 
3.     A. Stevenson testified that on July 24, 2021, the Tenant
kicked a hole in the stairwell of the
residential complex. Another tenant in the residential complex witnessed this
event and called the police.
Submitted into evidence
was photographs of the damage,
showing a large hole in the stairwell. Also submitted into evidence was a Criminal
Information that confirms the Tenant’s mischief charge
for damage to property of the wall of Huron County Housing.
 
4.     The section of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’) that governs this notice is subsection 61(1).
 
A landlord may give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy
if the tenant or another occupant
of the rental unit commits
an illegal act or carries
on an illegal trade,




 
business or occupation or permits a person to do so in the rental unit or the residential
complex.
5.    
I
find that the Tenant committed the illegal act of mischief
in kicking a hole in the wall of the staircase. I base this conclusion on
A. Stevenson’s testimony, the photographs and the Criminal Information.
 
6.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
7.     A. Stevenson testified
that since the July 24, 2021 incident,
the Tenant caused damage to the fire extinguisher in the
residential complex on December 22 and 24, 2021. The police responded and the Tenant
received two additional criminal charges. One of the conditions
of the Tenant’s release was not to attend the unit. Further, the Tenant did not
attend the hearing to testify to his circumstances for me to consider refusing
or delaying eviction. As such, relief will not be granted.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of February
14, 2022. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 14, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing on or before February 14, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 15, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit is not
vacated on or before February
14, 2022, then starting February 15,
2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
5.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord on or after February 15, 2022.
