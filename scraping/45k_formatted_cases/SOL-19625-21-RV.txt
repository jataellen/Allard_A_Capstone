Review Order
 
1260 Marlborough Court Holdings
Limited (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Richard Dimock (the 'Tenant') because he, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone he permitted in the residential complex has wilfully caused
undue damage to the premises; because he, another occupant of the rental unit
or someone he permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered
with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlord or another tenant; and because he, another occupant of the rental unit
or a person the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has seriously
impaired the safety of any person. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was resolved by order SOL-19625-21 issued on August
24, 2021. On September 23, 2021,
the Landlord requested a review of the order.
On September 28, 2021 interim order SOL-19625-21-RV-IN was issued.
 
The request was heard in Passcode:
927 9580 4323# on December
17, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s Representative, Sam Ursino and the Tenant attended the hearing. The Landlord’s
Agent Kim Harrop attended the hearing along with Richard Dimock, the Tenant’s
father. Matilda Noni attended as witness for the Landlord.
 
My oral decision rendered
at the review hearing is replaced in part by my final
decision as allowed under the Statutory
Powers Procedure Act (see paragraph 9).
 
Determinations:
 
Review:




 
 
 
1.    
The Member dismissed the N7 Notice
of Termination (non-voidable) because it was served within the seven day voiding period of the
N5 Notice of Termination given under section 64 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') which allows the Tenant to void the N5 Notice
by correcting the problem. The Landlord argued
the Member errored because the Tenant didn’t raise the argument and there was no evidence on the record that the Tenant led about
confusion caused.
 
2.    
On the basis of the submissions made in the request, I am satisfied that there is a serious error in the order or that a
serious error occurred in the proceedings
 
3.    
A
Member can ask a Tenant
during the hearing
if they were confused by the multiple
notices if the Tenant doesn’t raise this issue on their own.
If a
Member is satisfied having heard from the tenant
that the landlord caused confusion by giving
multiple notices, then having dismissed the application would be considered a
reasonable and acceptable outcome.
4.    
In this case, the
Tenant did not challenge the submissions made by the Landlord and made no argument on point or suggest that he did not understand the case required to be
met. I listened to the recording on
July 28, 2021 and there was no evidence from the Tenant that the multiple
notices caused confusion which led the member to dismiss the application. The recording
confirmed that only the Landlord was asked whether the multiple notices caused
the Tenant confusion.     At no time was the question posed to the Tenant
during the hearing and when the Tenant attempted to talk on point, the Tenant
was interrupted and prevented from doing so.
5.    
The Tenant did not challenge the
validity of the Notices or claim that he didn’t know the case to be met at the
review hearing. I find there was a serious error in the proceeding because that evidence could have changed
the outcome of the decision.
The Landlord’s request to
review order SOL-19625-21-RV is granted and the application is heard de novo.
 
Determinations:
 
6.     The Tenant did not challenge the Landlord’s evidence
that he wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit as
supported by photographs. The Tenant removed the slider doors of the bathroom
and entrance closet, broke the glass of the stove oven door, and cut a hole in the bathroom drywall. The Tenant also installed light fixtures and left wires hanging. The Tenant did not pay the amount
required to void the
N5 Notice of Termination.
 
7.     The Landlord referred
to other property
damage, related to medicine cabinet,
lock on storage room, paint
and floors which were not properly before me and was not considered.
 
8.     There’s no dispute
the Tenant’s father
paid the costs for the entrance door that was damaged when police forced entry
because the Tenant barricaded himself inside.




 
9.    
The rental unit was in a poor state of cleanliness and the unit
was inadequately prepared to be treated for bedbugs. The witness referred to
dates when the Tenant failed to prepare for bedbug treatment or refused entry
on September 22, 2020, October 13,
2020 and October 27, 2020, February 2, 2021, and February 16, 2021. The
Landlord did not present evidence to establish the Tenant’s actions continued
during the seven-day voiding period from January 12, 2021 to January 18, 2021.
This portion of the N5 Notice is void as such my oral ruling
made at the hearing is replaced. The Tenant is cautioned to be mindful of maintaining reasonable
cleanliness in the rental unit and cautioned against interfering or refusing
the Landlord entry to eradicate bedbugs.
 
10.  The Landlord received
complaints from other tenant the Tenant was not wearing
a mask in the common areas.
The Landlord requires all tenants to wear face masks in indoor public spaces in response
to Covid-19 as is mandatory
in Ontario. The Tenant provided no medical evidence for not wearing a mask and his
behaviour has the potential to seriously impair the safety of another person in
the complex.
 
11.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction subject to the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act.
 
12.  It’s appropriate to allow the Tenant an opportunity to preserve his tenancy as a means of
accommodation given, he was hospitalized for 21 days because of mental health
impairments on the December 29, 2020 incident. The Landlord knew or ought to
have known that the Tenant was not
well, and his impairments was connected
to the Tenant’s behaviour. The Landlord has a duty to accommodate to
the point of undue hardship. Although the Landlord claims there was no medical
evidence disclosed, the Landlord’s staff was informed through the Tenant’s
father.
 
13.  There’s no dispute the Tenant’s father paid for the
repair of the entrance door that was broken on December 29, 2020 and damage
related to flood that occurred in 2020 when pipes froze.
The Tenant’s father who attend the hearing commits to assist the Tenant
to repair the damage in the rental unit. The Tenant
understand and agrees
to wear his mask in the
common area of the residential complex until mandatory mask rule is lifted by
Ontario Government.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The request to review order
SOL-19625-21 issued on August 24, 2021 is granted. The order is cancelled and replaced as
follows:
 
2.    
Until the mandatory mask rule is lifted by the Ontario
government, the Tenant
shall stop posing a serious
risk to another person’s
safety by wearing a face mask in the common areas of the residential
complex at all times.
 
3.     On or before March 31, 2022, the Tenant shall restore/repair/and or replace the following
property damage:




 
a)      
The door of the bathroom;
 
b)    
the sliders doors in the bedroom
sliders;
 
c)     
the glass oven door of the stove;
 
d)    
the hole in drywall
of the bathroom wall; and
 
e)    
the Landlord’s light fixtures.
 
4.     If the Tenant fails to comply with paragraph 1 of this
order the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant apply to the Board
pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord must apply within
30 days from the date of the
breach.
