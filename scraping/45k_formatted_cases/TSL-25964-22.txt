On December 20, 2022, Toronto
Community Housing Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Annette
Brereton (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
gave a notice to terminate the tenancy.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant gave the Landlord a notice to terminate the
Tenant's tenancy effective November 30, 2021 and the Tenant did not move out of the rental
unit by the termination
date set out in the notice.
 
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the
rental unit on or before January 30, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before
January 30, 2022 the Tenant will
start to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from January 31, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 30, 2022, then starting
January 31, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
