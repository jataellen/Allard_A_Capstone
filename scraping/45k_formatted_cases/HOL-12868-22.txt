Tenants

Yasothara Mathurangan and Karunasingam Mathurangan (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ali Mian and Shamaila Mian (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants entered into an agreement to terminate the
tenancy.
 
This
application was heard by video conference on February 16, 2022. The Landlords,
the Landlords' Legal Representative, J. Ratnakumaran, and the Tenant,
Ali Mian attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlords
alleged that the Tenants signed an
agreement to terminate the tenancy as
of July 31, 2022.
2.    
The Agreement to End the Tenancy
(N11) shows it was signed by the Landlords and one of the Tenants, Ali Mian. The Landlords did not obtain
the signature of the second
Tenant.
 
3.     Subsection 77 (1) (a) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (‘the Act’) provides that a landlord may, without notice to the
tenant, apply to the Board for an order terminating a tenancy and evicting the tenant if, the landlord
and tenant have entered into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
4.     However, where there are two
Tenants and the agreement to terminate the tenancy is not
signed by both, evidence must be adduced to demonstrate that the Tenant who did
not sign the notice also intends to terminate the tenancy. Ali Mian could not speak on behalf of his
wife, who does not appear to want the tenancy terminated.
 
5.     The parties agree that the Landlords waived
the rent for December 2021, as compensation for the Tenants vacating the
unit. As the Landlord’s application
will be dismissed because




File Number: HOL-12868-22
 
the notice of termination is not
properly executed, the Tenants are liable for the payment of December 2021
rent.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlords’ application is dismissed.
 
2.    
The rent for the month of December 2021 is not waived by the Landlords.
