Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-08103-18
 











 
 
 
 

JV (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict IAR (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes.
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant; and because the
Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person the Tenant permitted in
the residential complex has seriously impaired the safety of any person. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit
after the termination date.
 
The hearing was held in Toronto on January 17, 2020.
 
Only the Tenant’s former legal
representative, YE, attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.      This matter has been adjourned twice, first on
October 15, 2018, and the second time on November 23, 2018.
 
2.      The matter was first adjourned, on October 15,
2018, at the request of the Tenant, because the Tenant had maintenance issues
under section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) to
raise, and the Tenant had not given his legal representative sufficient time to
prepare for the hearing.
 
3.      The matter was adjourned a second time, on
November 23, 2018, after the Member determined the amount of rent that was
owed.  The Member had insufficient time to hear the Tenant’s section 82 issues,
or to hear the Landlord’s L2 application.
 
4.      At the time of the hearing on November 23, 2018,
the Member found that the Landlord was not in serious breach of the Act
pursuant to subsection 83(3)(a) of the Act, to a level that rose to a “serious”
breach so as to trigger mandatory refusal of eviction.
 
5.      In the Interim Order, TNL-08103-18-IN2, the
Member also found that subsection 83(3)(b) of the Act was not engaged.  That
is, the Member determined that eviction was not barred pursuant to that section
of the Act.  The Member found that the Landlord’s sole or primary reason for
applying for termination was not retaliatory or vindictive, as a result of he
Tenant seeking to enforce his legal rights.
 
6.      Consequently, the Member found in the Interim
Order, TNL-08103-18-IN2, that the Tenant’s section 82 issues, and the
Landlord’s L2 application would be heard at a future date.
 
7.      The Tenant was evicted in the interim, and he
failed to keep in contact with his legal representative.
 
8.      The Tenant’s legal representative sought an
adjournment of the matter because she had been unable to reach the Tenant, and
she testified that his phone was out of service and he had left no forwarding
address.  The Tenant’s legal representative said that there is no prejudice to
the Landlord because the Tenant has already been evicted.
 
9.     
I find that the Tenant’s
legal representative has no instructions from her client.  She said that she
has not been able to get in touch with the Tenant in about a year, and he has
not made any attempt to be in touch with her.
 
10.  
The matter was already
adjourned to permit the Tenant to prepare his section 82 issues, and the Tenant
has exhibited no further interest in pursuing his section 82 issues.  The
Tenant did not authorize his legal representative to ask for the adjournment.
 
11.  
I find that it would be
severely prejudicial to the Landlord to further adjourn this matter to draw
this application out even further, in order to pursue issues that neither party
to the application has shown any active interest in pursuing.
 
12.  
The Landlord’s application
for rent arrears has been resolved.  The Tenant has already vacated the rental
unit, so the Landlord’s L2 application is moot.
 
13.  
Consequently, I deny the
request for an adjournment.
 
14.  
Since the Landlord did not
appear at the hearing to support their application, I find that this
application has been abandoned.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Landlord's application
is dismissed.
