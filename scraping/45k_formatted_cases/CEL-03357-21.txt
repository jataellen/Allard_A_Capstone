Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-03357-21



In the matter
of:


602, 3375 PONYTRAIL DRIVE MISSISSAUGA ON L4X1V8


 




Between:


Ferrand Construction Limited


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Priscilla Prado


 
Tenant



 
 
Ferrand
Construction Limited (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Priscilla Prado (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 7, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Bryan Rubin, attended
the hearing. As of 2:49 p.m. the Tenant was not present or
represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period
from July 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective August 25,
2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
3.    
The lawful monthly rent as of January 1, 2022 is $1,296.94.
4.    
The Tenant paid $3,175.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,205.95 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit has been paid to the Tenant
up to December 31, 2020.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with section 83 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19
on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenant, and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of
the rental unit on or before
February 25, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,158.03*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 14, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $42.64
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 15, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
25, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 26, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 25, 2022, then starting February 26, 2022,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 26, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 25, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $4,208.20** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction
will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and
the Tenant could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 26, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period
of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
