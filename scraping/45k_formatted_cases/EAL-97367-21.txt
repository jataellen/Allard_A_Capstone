Tenants



 
 
 
Michael Macgillivray (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Scott Painter and Ashton Belcher (the
'Tenants') because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they
permitted in the residential complex have wilfully or negligently caused undue
damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring
the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the damage; and because they, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. ; because the Landlord
requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupationThe Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on December 21, 2021 at 10:49 AM. The Landlord and the Tenants attended
the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
The application is
dismissed because the Landlord did not pay the Tenants the compensation within
the time required for this application under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the “Act”), prior to the termination date in the notice of termination.
 
2.    
On June 1, 2021, the Landlord
served the Tenants
an N12 Notice of Termination under section 48 of the Act because he and his spouse wish to
move into the rental unit.
 
3.    
Section 48.1 of the Act
states that, “a landlord shall compensate a tenant in the amount equal to one month’s
rent or offer the tenant another rental
unit acceptable to the tenant if
the landlord gives the tenant a notice of termination of the tenancy under
section 48”.




File Number: EAL-97367-21
 
4.    
Section 55.1 of the Act
requires that compensation under section 48.1 be paid to the tenant no later than on the termination date specified in the notice
of termination. In the
present case, the termination date in the N12 Notice of Termination is August 1,
2021.
 
5.    
Section
83(4) of the Act states that “[t]he Board shall not issue an eviction order in
a proceeding regarding termination of a tenancy
for the purposes of residential occupation,
. . . until the landlord has complied with section 48.1. . .”.
6.    
At the hearing (held
after the termination date in the N12 Notice), the Landlord acknowledged that he did not pay the Tenants
any compensation under
section 48.1 and he did not offer the Tenants an
alternative unit prior to September 2, 2021, after the termination date in the
N12 that forms the subject matter of this application.
 
7.    
The Landlord indicated
that he and the Tenants had verbally agreed to extend the termination date to
the end of August, but section 55.1 the Act requires that the compensation be paid
no later than the termination date specified in the notice of termination. I find that the Landlord
has not satisfied this statutory requirement for this application.
 
8.    
The N12 in itself is
formally defective, as the rent is due on the first of each month and the
tenancy is on a month-to-month basis. Subsection
48(2) of the Act requires that a notice of termination set a termination date that is “the day a period
of the tenancy ends.” When
rent us due on the first of each month, the period of a month-to-month tenancy
ends on the last day of the preceding month.
 
9.    
Both statutory
requirements are mandatory. Non-compliance
with these statutory requirements render the notice of termination incapable of terminating the tenancy.
 
10.  On both grounds
the application must therefore be dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord's application is dismissed.
