3775 FAIRFIELD AVENUE CRYSTAL BEACH ON L0S1B0


 




Between:


Smart Stays
Inc. - Michael Adams


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Andrea Steed
  Jeff Lawson


Tenants



 
 
 
Smart Stays Inc. - Michael Adams
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Jeff Lawson and Andrea Steed
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 1, 2022.
 
The Landlord, Michael Adams, the
Landlord’s Legal Representative, Peter Balatidis, and the Tenant, Andrea Steed (AS), attended the hearing. As of 11:20 a.m., the Tenant, Jeff Lawson, was not present or represented at the
hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to September
30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October 13, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants were still in possession of the rental
unit as of January 31, 2022.
 
3.     The Landlord’s Legal Representative submitted
that the lawful monthly rent was
$3,200.00 and that the Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
He added that the Tenants have not paid any rent
since August 2021 and that there is now 6 months rent currently owing.
 
4.     The Tenant (AS) submitted that she had wanted to
vacate the residence back in September 2021 but admitted that she had not given
proper notice to the Landlord. The Tenant (AS) added that she had already
moved most of her possessions out of the rental
unit but still had the key and had a few things left to pick up.




 
5.    
The Tenant (AS) also disputed
the monthly rent charge of $3,200.00 stating that it was her understanding that the rent
was actually $2,500.00. The Landlord’s Legal Representative explained
that the other named Tenant,
Jeff Lawson, had been making payments of at least $3,000.00
earlier in 2021.
 
6.     However, in order to facilitate an ending of this
tenancy, the Landlord agreed to the Tenant’s
request and lowered
the monthly rent owing from August 2021 to January
2021 from $3,200.00 to $2,500.00 per month.
 
7.     The Landlord’s Legal Representative then agreed to the tenancy
being officially ended as
of January 31, 2022 with the Tenant (AS) having the next day to retrieve her
remaining possessions from the rental unit.
 
8.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act as both parties want this tenancy to end as soon as
possible.
 
9.     This order contains
all of the reasons in this matter
and no further reasons will be given.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 1, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlord $15,000.00, which represents the amount of rent
owing from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.
 
3.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or
before March 1, 2022, the
Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 2,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 1, 2022, then starting February
2, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
5.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 2, 2022.
