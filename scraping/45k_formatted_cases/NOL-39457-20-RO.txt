and


 




 


 


Tenant




 


Amanda Welsh


 



 
 
 
Robert
Tuchenhagen (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Amanda Welsh (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that
the Tenant owes. This application was resolved by consent order NOL-39457-20
dated October 2020.
 
The Landlord
subsequently filed a request to re-open their application because
the Tenant did not
comply with the terms of the order.
 
This application was heard by video conference on November 18, 2021 and January 28, 2022. The Landlord and the Tenant attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period from December 1, 2019 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective January 7, 2020.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful monthly rent is $2,275.38.
 
4.    
The Tenant paid $29,664.20 after the application was filed.
 
5.     The Tenant, who has resided in the rental unit for about 4 years, testified that she resides
in the unit with her husband and two children and they have a combined income
of approximately $4,000.00 monthly in addition to $1,500.00 in child tax
benefit. The Tenant failed to pay the full rent owing because of other
financial commitments.
 
6.     The Landlord’s attempts at negotiating a repayment
agreement were unsuccessful as the Tenant breached consent order NOL-39457-20
issued on October 20, 2020.




 
7.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,200.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
8.     Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period from January 1, 2019 to January 7, 2020.
 
9.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction
subject to the condition(s) set out
in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a)
and 204(1) of the Act. The amount outstanding is substantial, and the Tenant who
earns a household income of approximately $4,000.00 monthly, failed to
prioritize rent payments.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant
voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before February 21, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $25,634.02*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February 10,
2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $72.33 per day for
compensation for the use of the unit
starting February 11, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before February 21, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated
from February 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit
is not vacated on or before February 21, 2022, then starting February 22, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
February 22, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 21, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $30,689.76** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after February




 
22, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
