Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-43390-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


5, 2640
ISABELLA STREET E THUNDER BAY ON P7E5C8


 




Between:


Dawson Properties


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kiara Ambridge


Tenant



 
 
Dawson Properties (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kiara
Ambridge (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered
with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlord or another tenant.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on October 25, 2021 at 11:10am.
 
Only the Landlord’s agent,
Mavis Waruk, attended
the hearing. The Landlord
was represented by Elizabeth Hewitson.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s L2 application is
based on a second N5 notice of termination served to the Tenant pursuant to subsection 68 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') on July 21, 2021 by mail with a
termination date of August 20, 2021.
 
2.     The Landlord had previously served
a first N5 on June 1, 2021 by mail with a termination
date of July 1, 2021 based on noise complaints received on April 27, 2021 and
May 27, 2021.
 
3.     By way of background, this is a month to month
tenancy where the monthly rent is
$885.00. The residential complex
consists of 21 apartments in a 3-storey
building. The Tenant moved in
in December 2020 and is the sole Tenant of the rental unit.
 
4.    
Based on the evidence
before the Board,
I am not satisfied the Tenant has substantially
interfered with the other tenants' reasonable enjoyment of the residential
complex and has also substantially interfered with a lawful right, privilege or
interest of the Landlord. The Landlord’s application is dismissed for the
following reasons.
 
L2 APPLICATION




File Number: NOL-43390-21
 
5.    
At the hearing, Mavis Waruk (MW),
testified that complaints were received from neighbouring tenants,
which formed the basis of the incidents
outlined on the N5 notices of termination. The Landlord
stated that the tenants
who witnessed these incidents were afraid and did not want to attend
the hearing to provide their first-hand evidence.
 
6.     The Landlord became
aware of the incident on July 9, 2021 by a telephone call that was received form a complainant. The
Tenant’s behaviour did not stop after the first N5 was served.
 
7.     The problem with the Landlord’s evidence is that it is
based entirely on other tenants’ account to the Landlord of what occurred on
April 27, 2021, May 27, 2021 and July 9, 2021.
While hearsay evidence
is admissible at the Board,
I have serious concerns about the reliability of this evidence in
these circumstances.
 
8.    
If the Landlord’s witnesses were unavailable for the hearing day, the Landlord could have
summonsed the witnesses, requested that the witnesses
participate via teleconference or request an adjournment at the hearing.
 
9.     I find that the Landlord has failed to lead sufficient
reliable evidence to establish on a balance of probabilities that the Tenant engaged in behaviour that substantially interfered with the enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant on July 9, 2021.
 
10.  As such, the Landlord’s application must be dismissed.
 
11.  This order contains
all of the reasons for my decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
