In the
  matter of:


202, 465
VICKERS STREET NORTH THUNDER BAY ON P7C4B4


 




Between:


Bruno Loffredo 1490400 Ontario Ltd.


Landlords




 


and


 




 


James Nelson Steven
Morriseau


Tenants



 
Bruno Loffredo and 1490400
Ontario Ltd. (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Steven
Morriseau and James Nelson (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 20, 2022. The Landlord, Bruno Loffredo, and the Tenant, Steven
Morriseau, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period
from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords
served a Notice of Termination effective September 23, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,250.00.
 
4.    
The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,250.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from August 1, 2021 to
September 23, 2021.
 
6.    
The Tenants paid $400.00
after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on
the parties and whether the Landlords attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenants, and find that it would not be unfair to postpone
the eviction until February 28, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




File Number: NOL-44198-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $5,764.73*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 28, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $41.10
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 29, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before
February 28, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlords or to the Board in trust:
i)          
$7,301.00 if the payment is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)         
$8,551.00 if the payment is made on or before
February 28, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not make full
payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline,
then the Landlords
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after March 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
