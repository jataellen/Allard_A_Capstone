  matter of:


110, 68 LINDSAY STREET

Between:


Shelly Smith


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Sasha White


Tenant



 
 
 
Shelly Smith (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sasha White
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the
order issued by the Board on November 12, 2021 with respect to application
HOL-11906-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that
the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order: On or
about November 8, 2021, you allowed a “No Trespass” individual access to the
residential complex. On November 10,
2021 and November 11, 2021, you interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the
unit by screaming in the common areas. On or about November 12, 2021,
you interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the unit by using a crowbar to gain access to
another residential unit.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 18, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January
19, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 19, 2022.
