Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-21334-22
 
 
In the matter of:      18 SCARFAIR PATHWAY
SCARBOROUGH ON M1B4E8
 
Between:                  Eric Breuker                                    Landlord
 
 
and
 




Anthony Krusinckas Georgia Smith


Tenants




 
 
 
On January 5, 2022, Eric Breuker
(the 'Landlord') applied in this L4 application for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Anthony
Krusinckas and Georgia
Smith (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent
they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the
mediated consent order issued by the Board on July 28, 2021 with respect to L1
application TEL-16826-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The consent order provided in
paragraph 3 that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section
78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the
Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants did not
meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I find that the Tenants have not
met the following condition specified in the order: The Tenants did not pay $2,861.60 rent on or before January
1, 2022. This was a breach of paragraph 2 of the consent
order. This L4 application was filed within 30 days of
the breach.
 
3.       
The previous L1 application included a request
for an order for the payment
of arrears of rent.
The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or
some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, in this L4
application the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenants agreed and were
ordered to pay $15,455.81 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's L1 application fee in the mediated consent
order TEL-16826-21. The
Tenants paid $14,085.00 towards the amount from the
consent order, but $1,370.81
remains outstanding. That amount is
included in this order. As a result, the previous consent order TEL-16826-21 is
cancelled.




 
5.       
Since the date of the previous
consent order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from
August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.
 
6.       
There was no last month’s rent deposit collected.
 
 
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.       
The mediated consent order TEL-16826-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move
out of the rental
unit on or before
February 5, 2022 (standard 11 days from the issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
If the Tenants made any payments
to the Landlord after this L4 application was filed on January 5, 2022, those amounts shall
be deducted from the calculations below.
 
Refer to the attached
Summary of Calculations
 
4.       
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $18,540.41*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 31, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous
L1 application.
 
5.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$94.08 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting February 1, 2022 to the date the Tenants actually move out of the
rental unit or get evicted.
 
6.       
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
5, 2022, the Tenants will start
to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from February 6, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 5, 2022, then starting February
6, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 6, 2022.

The tenant
has until February
4, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by February 4, 2022 the order will be
stayed and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on August
6, 2022 if the order has not been filed
on or before this date with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the
rental unit is located.
