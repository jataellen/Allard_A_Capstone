Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-03695-19
 











 
 

B.R.C. C/o Q.P.G.L (the 'Landlord') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict R (RR) F (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on May 6, 2019.
 
The Landlord’s legal representative, I.N, and the
Tenant attended the hearing. C.K (CK) testified for the Tenant and the Tenant
testified on his own behalf. 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant owes the Landlord
$5,805.00. In light of the circumstances disclosed at the hearing, termination
of the tenancy is postponed to June 30, 2019. 
My decision to proceed with the hearing
2.     
CS accompanied the Tenant to
the hearing. CS manages a team of social workers from Dixon Hall. CS testified
that she was familiar with the Tenant because until recently, the Tenant had a
social worker from Dixon Hall but in April, 2019 this individual left her
employment. CS testified that she has since had some contact with another
community organization that provides supports to the Tenant. CS testified that
someone from that organization told her that he or she was trying to arrange
legal representation for the Tenant in this matter. CS did not raise this as a
formal request to adjourn the hearing. CS did not have anything in writing from
either the other organization of from a legal representative, confirming that
someone had been retained to represent the Tenant in this matter or that
efforts were being made to arrange for a retainer.
3.     
After hearing from CS, I
asked the Tenant how he wanted to proceed. The Tenant testified that he was
willing and able to proceed with the hearing that day. The Tenant assured me
that he understood the purpose and the potential consequences of the hearing.
On that basis, I decided to hear the matter as there was no reason to postpone
it to another day.
The Tenant owes $5,805.00
4.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from December 1, 2018
to May 31, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective January 26, 2019.
5.     
The Tenant is in possession
of the rental unit. 
6.     
The monthly rent as of the
date of the hearing is $1,142.00. 
7.     
The Tenant has made no
payments since the application was filed. 
8.     
The parties do not dispute
the amount the Tenant owes the Landlord. Therefore, I am satisfied on a balance
of probabilities that the Tenant owes the Landlord $5,805.00, which includes
arrears of rent to May 31, 2019 and the application filing fee.
9.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,142.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
10.  
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2019 to January 26, 2019.
Section 83 considerations 
11.  
The Tenant testified that
the reason he accumulated arrears is that he had to stop working over the past
year due to a liver problem. The Tenant testified that he subsequently began
receiving financial assistance from either Ontario Works or the Ontario
Disability Support Program but until May 1, 2019, he was only receiving $700.00
per month. The Tenant testified that his monthly payments increased to
$1,200.00 on May 1, 2019. The Tenant testified that his family members were
helping him cover his expenses until December, 2018 but they have since stopped
doing so. This explains why the first rent period for which the Landlord is
claiming arrears begins December 1, 2018. 
12.  
Based on the Tenant’s candid
testimony about his financial situation, I find that the Tenant cannot afford
to continue living in the rental unit. The rent is $1,142.00 and he only
receives $1,250.00 in social assistance to cover all of his expenses. After
rent is deducted from his income, this would leave the Tenant only $100.00 to
cover food and other necessities of life. There is no money left over for the Tenant
to pay the Landlord anything toward the arrears he owes. In his testimony, the Tenant
agreed that this tenancy is not sustainable. 
13.  
Since the Tenant cannot
afford to pay the rent or arrears, I do not think that ordering conditional
relief from eviction would be appropriate. 
14.  
However, I find that it is
appropriate to extend the termination date to June 30, 2019. The Tenant
testified that he has several medical appointments in May and June, 2019, which
will make it difficult for him to move. Although the Tenant did not bring
written proof of these appointments to the hearing, I find that the Tenant’s
testimony was consistent, truthful and genuine. The Tenant expressed his
willingness to move, he just asked for time to find another apartment downtown,
close to the hospital where he has appointments. 
15.  
CS also testified that the
Tenant receives support from other organizations, including COST, which is a
community-based organization that supports seniors. CS testified that COST will
help the Tenant find another place to live. 
16.  
Extending the termination
date by six weeks to June 30th will give the Tenant time to work
with COST to find a new place to live, while allowing him to attend his medical
appointments. The Landlord is holding a last month’s rent deposit for the
Tenant, so the arrears will not increase by extending termination into the next
month. In other words, the extension should not cause the Landlord undue
hardship.  Accordingly, I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction
until June 30, 2019 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before June 30,
2019.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $3,770.57*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to May 13, 2019, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $37.55 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
May 14, 2019 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 30, 2019, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from July 1,
2019 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 30, 2019, then starting July 1, 2019, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 1, 2019.
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $5,805.00 if the payment is made on or before May 31, 2019, or
ii)       $6,947.00 if the payment is made on or before June 30, 2019**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after July 1, 2019 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
