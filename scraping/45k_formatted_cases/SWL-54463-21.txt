Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-54463-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


17, 716 INDIAN
ROAD NORTH SARNIA ON N7T7H1


 




Between:


TB Southwest Builders Ltd


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Tiffany Mills


Tenant



 
 
 
TB Southwest Builders Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Tiffany Mills (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
TB Southwest Builders Ltd (the 'Landlord') also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tiffany Mills (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard via video conference on January 17, 2022.
Only the Landlord’s representative Joe Alix attended the hearing.
At the hearing, the Landlord’s representative requested the consent
of the Board to withdraw
their L1 application.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     In accordance with subsection 200(4)
of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006, I consent
to the withdrawal of the Landlord’s L1 application.
 
2.     The Landlord applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant persistently failed to pay rent when it was due. Rent is due on the first of the month and
the tenancy is month to month.
 
3.     The Landlord’s representative testified that the
Tenant has persistently failed to pay the lawful rent on the date it was
due; the rent has been paid late 7 out of 12 months in 2019, 12 out of 12 months in
2020 and has been late 8 months in 2021. The Tenant is
however currently paid up to date and is no longer in rent arrears as of
January 4, 2022.




 
4.    
Section 58 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, (the ‘Act’) sets out that a landlord
may give a tenant notice of termination of their tenancy if the tenant
has persistently failed to pay rent on the date it becomes due and payable (N8
notice). The Landlord served the
Tenants with a N8 notice on August 17, 2021 that is
effective October 31, 2021. I accept the uncontested testimony and
evidence of the Landlord’s representative and am satisfied, on a balance of
probabilities, that the Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the
date it was due.
 
 
Section 83 considerations
 
5.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
6.     The Landlord was seeking a conditional pay-on-time
order as the Tenant is now up to date with rent payments and is unsure
if the COVID pandemic has impacted the Tenant
in any way. The Landlord’s
uncontested evidence established that the Tenant persistently paid late. I find that a pay-on-time order is
appropriate in these circumstances. As
termination is a remedy of last resort, I find the Tenant should be given
another opportunity with a pay-on-time order.
 
7.    
The Landlord has incurred
the cost of $186.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s L1 application is dismissed.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay
to the Landlord the full rent owing on or before
the first day of each month, commencing February 1, 2022
and for 12 months thereafter up to and including February 1, 2023.
 
3.     If the Tenant fails to comply with the conditions set out in paragraph
2 above, then, within 30 days
of the breach, the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord
must make any such application no later than thirty
days after any such breach of the
provisions contained in paragraphs 2 of this order.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
this application.




 
 
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing on or before March 3, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 4, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.

Issued
 
South West-RO
