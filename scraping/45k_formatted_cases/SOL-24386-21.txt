In the matter
of:


2, 672 QUAKER
ROAD W WELLAND ON L3C7J3


 




Between:

Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Derrick (dj) Petrovsky Josh Burnett
Kristine Halsted


Tenants



 
 
Nicole Catherine Ruoho and Peter
Wayne Ruoho (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kristine
Halsted, Derrick (dj) Petrovsky and Josh Burnett
(the 'Tenants') for the following reasons:
•        
because they, another occupant of
the rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex
have wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises.
The Landlords has also applied for an order requiring the Tenants to compensate
the Landlords for the damage;
•        
because they, another occupant of
the rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex
have substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlords or another tenant; and
•        
because they have been persistently late in
paying their rent.
The Landlords also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 20, 2021 at 10:53am.
 
Only the Landlords attended
the hearing. The Landlords were represented by Kelly Hawkes.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     By way of background, this is a month to month tenancy
in which the rent is due on the
first of the month in the amount of $1,500.00.
 
2.    
The residential complex is a triplex
with three rental
units that were inherited by the
Landlord in April 2020.
 
3.     As of the hearing
date, the Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.




 
4.    
The Landlord’s L2 application is based on two
notices of termination: the N5 and N8, both of which were served to the Tenants
by mail on August 6, 2021 with termination dates of September 15, 2021 and
October 31, 2021 respectively.
 
TERMINATON: SUBSTANTIAL INTERFERENCE (N5)
 
5.    
The N5 notice of termination was served pursuant
to section 64 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006. Subsection
64(3) of the Act states:
 
(3) The notice of termination under
this section is void if the tenant,
within seven days after
receiving the notice, complies with the requirement referred to in clause (2)
(c) or makes arrangements satisfactory to the landlord to comply with that
requirement.
 
6.    
Thus, the Tenants had seven days
to remedy the situation by refraining from the behaviour being complained of in
the N5 and restoring the residential premises to its original state.
As the N5 notice of termination was deemed to be served
on August 11, 2021, the voiding period was between
August 11, 2021 and August 19, 2021.
 
7.    
The problem with the Landlords’ evidence was that it
was insufficient to establish that
the Tenant continued to engage in the conduct listed N5 notice of termination
during the voiding period. I say this because there was no evidence before me
that indicated the Landlord attended the rental unit within the remedy period
or shortly thereafter to observe the state
of the carpets or the Landlord received any complaints of the smell of smoke
coming from the Tenants’ unit during this period.
 
8.     In fact, the evidence before
the Board was the next time the Landlords went to the rental
unit was on December 11, 2021 – over three months after the N5 was served.
 
9.     Therefore, I must find that the Tenants voided the N5
notice in accordance with section 64(3) of the Act. As the N5 notice of termination was voided, the Landlord’s L2 application
for eviction on the grounds of substantial interference must be dismissed.
 
TERMINATION: PERSISTENT LATE PAYMENT OF RENT (N8)
 
10.  The Landlord’s L2 application is based on a N8 notice
of termination served to the Tenants on August 6, 2021 with a termination date of
October 31, 2021 pursuant to subsection 58(1) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006.
 
11.  The Tenants have persistently failed to pay the rent
on the date it was due. I say this because the Landlords’ uncontested evidence was that for the period
between October 2020 and August 2021, the Tenants have persistently paid
their rent late every month.
 
12.  Since the N8 notice of termination was served to the Tenants,
the Tenants continued to pay their rent late for the months of September 2021 – December
2021.
 
13.  The Landlords sought
an order terminating the tenancy.
 
14.  The Landlords also sought reimbursement of the application filing
fee in the amount of
$186.00.




 
15.  Based on the evidence before the Board,
I am satisfied the Tenant
has been persistently late in paying their rent.
 
16.  The Landlord’s request
for termination of the tenancy is granted.
 
17.  The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,500.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
18.  Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from October
15, 2020 to October 31, 2021
 
19.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Landlord is unaware of any
circumstances that would justify relief from eviction.
 
SECTION 89(1) DAMAGE CLAIM
 
20.  The Landlord’s L2 application also contained a claim for compensation for the damage caused by the Tenants in the
amount of $1,500.00
 
21.  In order for an application to succeed under
subsection 89(1) of the Act, a landlord
must establish the following:
 
I.       
There was property damage
to the rental unit or residential complex;
 
II.       
The damage is “undue”
meaning that it is not normal wear and tear and it is not insignificant; and
 
III.       
The damage was a result of wilful or negligent conduct
by the tenant, guest or occupant.
 
22.  In this context,
I take the word “property” to refer to the physical
objects like the walls,
ceilings, floors, appliances and fixtures in a residential complex.
 
23.  If all of these factors
are met, then the amount the Board can award is limited
to the reasonable cost of repair
– the replacement cost cannot be awarded
unless it is not
reasonable for the damage to be repaired.
 
24.  The Landlords’ uncontested evidence was on July 24,
2021, it came to the Landlords’ attention that the carpet in the rental unit
had been ripped out by the Tenants in the bedroom and living room areas This was done without the consent of the Landlords
so when the Landlords inquired with the Tenants about this, the Tenants
stated that the previous landlord had provided his consent. When the Landlord
spoke to the previous landlord about this issue, he confirmed that the Tenants’
were never given consent to remove or change the carpeting in the rental unit.
 
25.  The Landlord proceeded
to obtain quotes
for the replacement of the carpets in these
areas on December 10, 2021 and found the most
affordable option to be $1,500.00.




 
26.  As of the
hearing date, the carpeting has not yet been replaced because the money has not been paid by the Tenants. The
Landlords further confirmed that the carpet has not been reinstalled in the rental unit as per the inspection they conducted on December 11, 2021.
 
27.  The Landlord seeks
reimbursement for the $1,500.00 quote to reinstall the carpet that was ripped out by the Tenants.
 
28.  Based on the uncontested evidence
before the Board, I find the damage to the carpets in the living room and bedroom areas
constitutes property damage that is undue and not a result of normal
wear-and-tear; rather, it’s a result of the Tenants’ willful conduct of ripping
them out. I find the quote obtained by the Landlords to be reasonable and this
amount shall be awarded in full.
 
29.  An order shall issue accordingly.
 
30.  This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated, as of
October 31, 2021. The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before February 12, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $1,500.00, which
represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damaged property.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $3,085.19 (less
any amount paid by the Tenants to the Landlord after the application was filed
with the Board), which represents compensation for the use of the unit from November 1, 2021 to February 1, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlords
$49.32 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from February 2, 2022 to
the date they move out of the unit.
 
5.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing on or before February 12, 2022,
they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 13, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
7.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 12, 2022, then starting
February 13, 2022, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
8.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after February 13, 2022.
