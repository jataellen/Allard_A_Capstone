Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-69024-17 
 










 
 

[Company
name removed] (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict SJ and RJ (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent
that the Tenants owe. The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges and related
administration charges.
 
This
application was heard in Mississauga on October 24, 2017.
 
The Landlord's Agent, PS and the Landlord's Legal Representative,
DR and the Tenant, RJ attended the hearing.
 
This order was heard together with CET-69542-17 but a separate
order is being issued for CET-69542-17.
 
Preliminary issue:
 
The spelling of the Tenant’s surname was corrected. SJ was removed
as a Tenant because she was not in possession of the unit at the time the
application was filed.   
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent he was required to pay for the period from
July 1, 2017 to October 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination effective August 9, 2017.
2.      The
Landlord incurred charges of $10.00 for cheques tendered by or on behalf of the
Tenant, which were returned NSF and $40.00 for related administration charges.
3.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,544.83 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
4.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 15, 2016 to
August 9, 2017.
5.      The
Tenant has paid $3,089.70 to the Board in trust since the application was
filed. **.
6.      The
Tenant stated that from April to July the rent was paid by direct debit. He
cancelled the automatic payment for the July 2017 rent and tried to submit a
cheque but it was refused by the Landlord. He stated the Landlord wanted
payments through the bank only effective April 1, 2017. The Tenant submitted
his bank statement which confirmed that the Tenant put a stop payment on the
July direct payment. The statement also showed that the Tenant’s account was
overdrawn in July 2017.
7.      The
Landlord’s Agent, PS testified that sometime in December 2016 and January 2017
the Landlord sent out a variety of notifications to the 137 residents. There
were postings put up throughout the building, emails were sent to residents who
had email and notices were also delivered through the door slots of the
resident units advising all the residents that they can only make their rent
payments through preauthorized payment, at the bank or certified funds. 
8.      PS
stated that the Tenant’s July 2017 rent payment went through as a direct
deposit and was returned NSF. PS testified that Tenant’s wife came to the
office and told her they did not have the rent money. At some later point, the
Tenant came with a cheque which she refused to accept because they had already
been advised there was no money in the Tenant’s account.
9.      I
find therefore, that the Tenant on a balance of probabilities did not have
sufficient funds for the rent in July 2017 and August 2017, and the reason he
did not pay for those months is not due to the Landlord changing their
permitted rent payment methods.
10.   The
Tenant proposed a payment plan of $200.00 every 20th of the month to
address the arrears because he stated he wished to continue the tenancy. He
stated his daughter goes to school in the area.
11.   The
Landlord submitted the payment would take too long to address the arrears owing
and seeks a standard 11 day order.
12.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act because I do not believe the Tenant has the
financial resources to pay the rent and the arrears.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated and the Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before November 6, 2017.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,350.32*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to October 26, 2017 and the total charges
related to NSF cheques tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant,
less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $50.79 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting October 27, 2017 to the date the move out of the unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
November 6, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from November 7, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before November 6, 2017, then starting November
7, 2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after November 7,
2017.
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, he must pay to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $3,329.62 if the payment is made on or before October 31, 2017, or
ii)       $4,874.45 if the payment is made on or before November 6, 2017**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after November 7, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
10.   The
Board shall pay to the Landlord the amount of $3,089.70 together with any
accrued interest. **
