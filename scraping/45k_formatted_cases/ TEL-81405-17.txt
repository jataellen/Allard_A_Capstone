Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-81405-17
 










 
 
 

G.C.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict K-L.S.
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Lindsay on August 15, 2017.
Only the Landlord attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from June 1, 2017 to August 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective June 17, 2017.
2.      The Tenant
is in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.      The
monthly rent as of the date of the hearing is $830.00
 
4.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $830.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 28, 2017
to June 17, 2017.
6.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of
the rental unit on or before August 28, 2017.
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,296.84*, which represents
the amount of rent owing and compensation up to August 17, 2017, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $27.29 per day for
compensation for the use of the unit starting August 18, 2017 to the date the
Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of
filing the application.
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on
or before August 28, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be
simple interest calculated from August 29, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
6.    
If the unit is not vacated on or before August 28, 2017, then
starting August 29, 2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
August 29, 2017.
8.    
If, on or before August 28, 2017, the Tenant pays the amount of
$2,665.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction
will be void.  This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the
Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on
time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that
subsection on or after August 29, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant
possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
