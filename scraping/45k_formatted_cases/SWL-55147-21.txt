Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: SWL-55147-21



In the
  matter of:


108, 15 DELLROY AVENUE KITCHENER ON N2A2S2


 




Between:


2296342 Ontario Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Sonya
  Niblock


Tenant



 
 
2296342 Ontario
Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Sonya Niblock (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on January 6, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Vesna Soro, attended the hearing. As of 2:08 p.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant
has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 21, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant
is in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is
$1,500.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,500.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from October 15, 2020 to
September 21, 2021.
 
6.    
The Tenant
paid $4,500.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until January 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 31, 2022.




File Number: SWL-55147-21
 
2.    
As of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the
Landlord is entitled to by $293.98*.
 
3.    
However, the Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount the
Landlord owes the Tenant: $49.32 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 15, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit, and $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
The Landlord
or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum
of money that is owed as a result of this order.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022, then starting February
1, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 1, 2022.
 
7.    
If, on or before
January 31, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $2,186.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.    
The Tenant may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if the Tenant pays the amount required
under that subsection on or after February 1, 2022 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to
make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
