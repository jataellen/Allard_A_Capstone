Order under Section 122
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNT-28299-20
 
 



In the matter of:


23 STONE COURT
NORTH YORK ON M9M1N1


 




Between:


Isabel Maria
Da Costa
Alfredo Jose Catarina Matos Gomes


Tenants




 


 
and


 




 


Maria Laura Estrada


Landlord



 
 
 
Isabel Maria Da Costa and Alfredo
Jose Catarina Matos Gomes (the 'Tenants') applied for an order reducing
the rent increase
because Maria Laura Estrada (the 'Landlord') failed to comply with the terms of an Agreement to
increase the rent above the Guideline.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on November 25, 2020 at 9:50 A.M.
 
Ms. Patricia Pereira attended
the hearing and stated that was
present to speak
on behalf of the Tenants.
 
The Landlord was also in attendance at the hearing.
 
It is determined that:
 
1.    
Ms. Patricia Pereira is not
licensed by the Law Society of Ontario to provide legal services, and no
written authorization was provided by the Tenants authorizing this
representative. Therefore, I find that Ms. Pereira
cannot represent the Tenants in this
proceeding.
 
2.    
As the Tenants did not attend the
hearing for their application and there was no authorized representative present, I find that this application should
be dismissed as abandoned. Therefore, I will not consider the merits of the application.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.   
This application is dismissed.
