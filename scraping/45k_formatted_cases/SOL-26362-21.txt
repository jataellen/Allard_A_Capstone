Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26362-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


51, 57 FOREST
AVENUE HAMILTON ON L8N1X3


 




Between:


Dms Property Management Ltd


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Chris Evans
Katherine Zadorazniak


Tenants



 
 
 
Dms Property
Management Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Chris Evans
and Katherine Zadorazniak (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants
pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the Board on July 20, 2021 with respect to application
SOL-20246-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenants have not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The
Tenants failed to pay $500.00 towards the arrears
on or before October 15, 2021. The
Tenants failed to pay the lawful monthly rent in full on or before November 1,
2021.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order
required the Tenants
to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenants
were ordered to pay $6,880.30 for rent arrears
in Order SOL-20246-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $5,880.30 and
that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order
SOL-20246-21 is cancelled.
 
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from October 1, 2021
to November 30, 2021.




 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,550.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from November
1, 2020 to December 31, 2020.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order SOL-20246-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 15, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord $9,184.14*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 4, 2022, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $50.96
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 5, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
15, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 16,
2022 at .00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 16, 2022.

The tenant
has until January
14, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 14, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires

where the rental unit is located.
