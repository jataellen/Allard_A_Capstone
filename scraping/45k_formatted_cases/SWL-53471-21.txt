Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-53471-21



In the
  matter of:


024, 15 SNYDER
AVENUE NORTH ELMIRA ON
  N3B2A9


 




Between:


Skyline Living


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Ginabelle Louis


Tenant



 
 
Skyline Living (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ginabelle Louis (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 3, 2022. The Landlord's Agent, Michelle Twiss, and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from March 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective July 9, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent as of February 1, 2022 is
$1,270.06.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
 
6.     Parties agree that the amount outstanding to February 28, 2022, inclusive
of rent arrears ($14,992.54) and costs ($186.00) is $15,178.54.
7.     At the hearing, the Tenant testified
that she had been employed by the Landlord, was dismissed without cause and has
not been able to secure further employment or secure alternative housing. The Tenant further testified that she is
only able to work weekends because her daughter
is being home schooled as a result
of the ongoing pandemic. The Tenant also testified that she has had
the same employment for 6 years working online and has been restricted from
doing field work which has resulted in a further loss of income.
8.    
At the hearing
the Tenant requested relief from eviction in the form of a proposed payment plan of her monthly rent plus $500.00
per month until the arrears
could be paid in full. The Landlord was opposed to
this request.




 
9.    
The Landlord’s
agent testified that the Tenant was provided with a letter in June of 2021 that
provided a list of resources to the Tenant to assist with support for paying
the rent and invited the Tenant to reach out to the Landlord to discuss a plan for rent arrears.
The Landlord’s agent further testified that the Tenant was provided with
the same list of resources in November of 2021 and the Tenant has not made any
attempts to secure additional funds to support the Tenant’s position that they
should be granted relief from eviction. The
Landlord’s agent also testified that the Tenant has not made any payments at
all to the Landlord since March of 2021 and that granting relief would be
prejudicial to the Landlord under the circumstances.
10. 
In response, the
Tenant submitted into evidence a series of screenshot images which identified units she was applying for in support
of her assertion that she cannot find other
suitable housing. Contained within
those screenshots was an image that referred to a person named “Kristin Kirby”. The Tenant identified this person as
someone that she communicated with for financial
assistance for the rent. It was the Tenant’s position that the Landlord
refused to accept money from the agency that Kristen Kirby was employed by
because they just wanted to evict her.
11. 
I do not find the evidence
of the Tenant determinative that the Landlord
refused to accept rent from the Tenant. The Tenant
did not call on Kristen Kirby to provide any evidence regarding any discussions
they may have had with the Landlord to corroborate the Tenant’s position that
the Landlord refused to accept any rent. There was also no clear language in
the communication that the Landlord refused to accept rent and the Landlord’s
agent denied that they refused to accept rent.
12.  After considering the evidence before
me and the submissions of both parties, I do not find it appropriate under the
circumstances to order a payment plan for relief from eviction. The Tenant failed to provide evidence to
support the position that they could pay the rent and make an additional payment towards the arrears and the Tenant
has not made any payments at
all to the Landlord since March of 2021. Based on the evidence before me, the
tenancy does not appear to be viable.
13.  Based on the Tenant’s submission that
they have a 10-year-old daughter that is being home-schooled, and that the move
would cause a disruption to their learning schedule, and based also on the
Tenant’s submissions regarding the affordability of alternative accommodations and their lack of financial
resources, I find that it would not be unfair
to delay eviction under the circumstances.
14.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until March 30, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of
the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 30, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$14,798.62*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 24, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $41.76 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 25, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
March 30, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
March 31, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 30, 2022, then starting
March 31, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 31, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)          
$15,178.54 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022, or
ii)         
$16,448.60 if the payment
is made after February 28, but on or before March 30, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after March
31, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
