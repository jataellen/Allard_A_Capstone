Linda Swanson


Tenant




 


 
and


 




 


Rebecca Johnstone


Landlord



 
 
 
Linda Swanson (the 'Tenant')
applied for an order determining that Rebecca Johnstone (the 'Landlord') has collected or retained money illegally.
 
This application was heard by
video conference on January 26, 2022, beginning at 9:00 a.m.. Only Tenant
attended the hearing. As of 10:45 a.m. the Landlord was not present
or represented at this hearing
although properly served with a notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Landlord collected $1,100.00 from the Tenant
for the last month’s rent deposit on May 20, 2020.
 
2.       
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on December
31, 2020.
 
3.       
The unopposed testimony of the Tenant
is that the Landlord has not returned
the last month’s rent deposit.
 
4.       
Based on the evidence
before me, I am
satisfied that the Landlord collected a rent deposit from
the Tenant and failed to return the deposit.
 
5.       
As a result, the Tenant is entitled to be reimbursed by the Landlord
in the amount of
$1,100.00. The Tenant is also entitled
to the costs of filing the application.
 
6.       
An order will issue
accordingly.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The Landlord shall pay to the Tenant the sum of $1,100.00. This amount represents the money collected for the last month’s rent deposit.




File Number: SOT-20945-21
 
2.       
The Landlord shall also pay to the Tenant $50.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.       
The total amount the Landlord owes to the Tenant is $1,150.00.
 
4.       
If the Landlord does not pay the
Tenant the full amount owing by February 19, 2022 the Landlord will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February
20, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the outstanding balance.
 
5.       
The Tenant has the right, at any time, to collect
the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
