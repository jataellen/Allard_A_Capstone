Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-29179-20
 
 
In the matter of:      UNIT 1, 27 HENRY STREET
S
GEORGINA, KESWICK
ON L4P2L5
 
Between:                  Alex Hazin                                    Landlord
 
 
and
 




Megan Robertson Rebecca Robertson


Tenants




 
 
 
Alex Hazin (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Megan Robertson and Rebecca Robertson
(the 'Tenants'). The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was scheduled by video conference on October 14, 2021 at 9am.
The Landlord and the Tenants attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
 
1.       
The residential
unit is in a 2-unit building. The Landlord alleges that the Tenants are
responsible for 2/3 of the
residential complex’s utilities, with the tenant in
the other unit being responsible for the balance. The Landlord further alleges that the Tenants failed pay their share, which resulted in the township
placing an attachment or tax lien on the property.
2.       
The Tenants
did not dispute
that they are responsible for 2/3 of the
utilities. They testified that while they have occasionally been late with utility bill payments, they were up-to-date as of the hearing date. They
submitted that any remaining unpaid utilities were the responsibility of the
other tenant in the residential complex.




File Number: TNL-29179-20
 
3.       
The Landlord
called into the hearing
and did not provide
any other evidence, written documents or otherwise
to substantiate his claim that any monies
were owed by the
Tenant to the Landlord.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.       
The Landlord has
failed to establish on a balance of
probabilities that the Tenants have failed to meet their obligations under the lease to make their utilities
payments. I find for the
Tenant, that nothing is owing to the Landlord and they are up to-date
for utilities and must keep up-to-date in payments of
2/3 of their share of utilities for the unit.
2.       
The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
