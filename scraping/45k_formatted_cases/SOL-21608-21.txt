Order under
Section 79
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number: SOL-21608-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
205, 40 WEST AVENUE
SOUTH HAMILTON ON L8N2S1


 




Between:


Liuna Hamilton Association


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Judy Berfelz


Tenant



 
 
Liuna Hamilton Association (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy because Judy Berfelz (the 'Tenant')
abandoned the unit.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on August 11, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord’s Legal
Representative, Paul Startek, attended the hearing. As of 1:03 p.m., the Tenant
was not present or represented at the hearing,
although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     This application asks that the Board determine
the Tenant has abandoned the rental unit and issue an order terminating the
tenancy on that basis.
 
2.     The Board’s Interpretation Guideline 4 entitled
Abandonment of a Rental Unit explains
the concept of abandonment as follows:
 
Abandonment is a unilateral act by the tenant to relinquish their tenancy and give up possession of the rental unit without
properly giving notice of the termination to the landlord. If the landlord
is not sure whether or not a rental unit has been abandoned,
they may file an application for determination of this issue with the Board;
however, it should be noted the Board has no jurisdiction to issue an order for
rent or compensation if a tenant is no longer in possession of the rental unit
(see section 87). In this case, the landlord may seek a remedy by applying to
Court.
 
3.    
Section 2(3) of the RTA provides
that a rental unit is not considered abandoned where the tenant is not in
arrears of rent. Even if there is evidence of abandonment, such as the
furniture being removed, the landlord
cannot treat the unit as abandoned before the end of the rental period
if the rent is fully paid.
 
4.    
In this case, the Tenant
is in arrears and has not paid any rent since March 2020.




File Number: SOL-21608-21
 
5.    
The Landlord testified that the
Tenant failed to respond to letters sent on February 13, 2020, and September 18, 2020. The Letter dated
September 18, 2020 asked the Tenant
to contact the Landlord otherwise
the Landlord would deem the rental unit abandoned by the Tenant.
 
6.     The Landlord testified
that the last time they made contact
with the Tenant was in November 2019.
 
7.     The Landlord testified
that several notices
were affixed to the Tenant’s
door and they remain affixed to the day of the
hearing. The Landlord also testified that they found numerous notices that were
slipped under the Tenant’s door.
 
8.     The Landlord testified that the Tenant’s unit appears
to have been unchanged for an extended period. The Landlord further
testified that an annual inspection was completed on
August 18, 2020 and nothing seems to have change.
 
9.     The Landlord testified
that they are unable to locate the Tenant and that they tried to do a search through Service Ontario but were
unable to due to Covid.
 
10.  The Landlord has continued to check on the unit and no change has been observed.
 
11.  Based on the uncontested testimony from the Landlord
as well as the evidence they provided, I am satisfied on the balance
of probabilities that the Tenant
has abandoned the unit.
 
12.  The Landlord has continued to check on the unit and no change has been observed.
 
13.  The Landlords made reasonable efforts to contact and
locate the Tenant for several months. All of the cumulative evidence, and the
untouched state of the Tenant’s remaining possessions supports
that the Tenant
has abandoned the rental
complex as alleged by the
Landlord.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated, as of October
1, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
