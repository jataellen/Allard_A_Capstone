Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-98071-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


4,
  99 HALL AVENUE E RENFREW ON K7V2S2


 




Between:


McGrimmon Holdings


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Shawn McAdam


Tenant



 
 
 
McGrimmon Holdings (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Shawn McAdam
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 18, 2022. Only
the Landlord's Agent, Tammy Smith attended
the hearing. As of 10:14 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October 1, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     
The lawful monthly rent is $1,000.00.
 
4.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,000.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from July 16, 2021 to
October 1, 2021.
 
6.     
The Tenant paid $3,000.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties
and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant
and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 13, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $2,109.79*, which represents the
amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
2, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $32.88 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 3, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 13, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 14, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 13, 2022, then starting February
14, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 14, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before February 13,
2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $4,186.00** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 14, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
 
February 2, 2022 Date Issued
Eastern-RO
255 Albert Street, 4th Floor
Ottawa ON K1P6A9
