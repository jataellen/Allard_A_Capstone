Roseanne Allega (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Eldon Bell and Robert Debbie
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe.
 
This application was heard by video conference
on January 13, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Nathan
Chevalier, attended the hearing. As of 11:19
a.m. the Tenants were not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from February 1, 2021 to December
31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 16, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on
December 15, 2021. The Tenants
were in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.
3.    
The lawful monthly rent was $875.00.
4.    
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
5.    
The Tenants have made no payments
since the application was filed.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of December 15, 2021, the date the Tenants
gave vacant possession of the
rental unit to the Landlord.
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $7,866.44*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to December 15, 2021.




File Number: NOL-43976-21
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or
before February 4, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 5,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
