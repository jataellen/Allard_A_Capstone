606, 100 UNITY ROAD TORONTO ON M4J5B2

and


 




 


Annabelle Braihwaite


Tenant



 
 
 
On January 12, 2022, Heathercross
Charitable Foundation (the 'Landlord') applied in this L4 application for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict Annabelle Braihwaite (the 'Tenant')
and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant
owes because the Tenant failed to
meet a condition specified in the hearing order issued by the Board on October
13, 2021 with respect to L1 application TSL-22472-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The previous hearing order
provided in paragraph 6 that the Landlord could apply to the
Board under section 78 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act') without
notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if
the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I find that the Tenant has not met
the following condition specified in the order: The Tenant failed to pay the lawful monthly
rent in full, on or before January
1, 2022, which was a breach
of paragraph 4 of the hearing order. This L4 application was filed within 30 days of the breach.
 
3.       
The previous L1 application included a request
for an order for the payment
of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the
Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in
addition to eviction, in this L4 application the Landlord is entitled to
request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.       
In paragraph 2 of the previous
hearing order, theTenant was ordered to pay $6,193.24 for rent arrears. The amount that is still owing from that order
is $4,269.24 and that amount is
included in this order. As a result, the previous order TSL-22472-21 is
cancelled.
 
5.       
Since the date of the hearing
order, the Tenant
has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from October 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.




 
6.       
On January 1, 2016 the Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,124.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being
held by the Landlord.
 
7.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenant for the period from the
date of collection, February 1, 2020
to the date of this order, January 25, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The previous hearing order
TSL-22472-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 5, 2022 (standard 11 days from the
issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
If the Tenant made any payments
after this L4 application was filed on January 12, 2022,
those amounts shall be deducted from the calculations below.
 
See attached
Summary of Calculations
 
4.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$4,024.32*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to this order date, January 25, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
5.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $37.55 per day for
compensation for the use of the unit starting January 26, 2022 to
the date the Tenant actually moves out of the rental unit or gets evicted.
 
6.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
5, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 6, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 5, 2022, then starting February
6, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 6, 2022.
