In the matter

STREET TORONTO ON M5R2R1


 




Between:


720745 Ontario
Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Anil Trikha


Tenant



 
 
 
720745 Ontario Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Anil Trikha (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant or another occupant
of the rental unit has committed an illegal act or has carried out, or
permitted someone to carry out an illegal trade, business or occupation in the rental
unit or the residential complex. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 7, 2021.
At 11:39 am only the Landlord Paul Kyte (PK) attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
2.     The rental unit is on the top floor
of a multi-unit residential complex.
 
3.     The Tenancy began in or around 2011.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,120.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 1, 2021 to August 31, 2021.
 
N6 Notice and L2 Application:
 
6.    
The Landlord’s application is predicated on an N6 notice of termination (N6 notice) dated August 4, 2021 with a date of
termination of August 31, 2021.




 
7.    
The reason provided in the N6
notice states that the Landlord believes “that you or someone living
with you has committed an illegal act or is carrying on an illegal
business at the residential complex….”
 
8.     The Landlord alleges that on or around August 4, 2021,
the Tenant was observed removing and stealing signs and holders from both
elevator at the residential complex and that the Tenant has committed the illegal act of mischief
and theft of property under
$5000.00.
 
9.     It was the uncontested testimony of PK that the Tenant,
on August 4, 2021 was observed
entering the elevator(s) at the residential complex with a screwdriver and
proceeded to remove the sign holders
and signage. The Landlord did not approach the Tenant
for fear of aggression. The Landlord
called the Police who attended the unit but the Tenant refused to answer the
door.
 
10. 
PK testified that the signage
contained important contact
and emergency information and protocols for covid 19 for the safety of all tenants.
 
11.  PK further testified that the Tenant continues to
remove and steal signage from around the residential complex on multiple
occasions and that the Tenant was charged with 9 counts of mischief and theft
under $5000.00 from August 19, 2021 to November 15, 2021. Although no evidence was submitted, PK
referred to evidence submitted by the Tenant
acknowledging “a period
of detention under
Ontario Court proceeding…beginning August 19, 2021 and concluding with unconditional subsequent release on November
15, 2021.”
 
12.  Based on the uncontested evidence before me, I am
satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Tenant has committed illegal
acts in the residential complex, specifically
removing and stealing
signage from the elevators in the residential complex.
 
13. 
On the date of the hearing,
PK said he would agree
to a conditional order in place of eviction as an effort to preserve the
tenancy. An order will issue
accordingly.
 
14. 
This order contains all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.   
For a period of 12 months from the
date of this Order, the Tenant shall not repeat any of the behaviours specified in the N6 notice
of termination, specifically removing and stealing signs and holders from the
elevators at the residential complex.
 
2.   
If the Tenants breaches
the terms in this agreement related to the issues in the application, the Landlord may apply under
section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, without notice to the
Tenant, for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The
Landlord must make this application no later than 30 days after the Tenant’s
breach.
