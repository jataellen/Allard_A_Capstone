Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-23673-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


108 EAGLE AVENUE BRANTFORD ON N3S1Z5


 




Between:


Brenda Beaven


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Janet Staats
  John Moth


Tenants



 
 
 
Brenda Beaven (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict John Moth
and Janet Staats (the 'Tenants') because they, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for
each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on October 27, 2021. Only the Landlord and the Landlord’s witness,
C.A., attended the hearing. As of 10:12 a.m. the Tenants were not present
or represented.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
This application is based on a second notice
of termination N5 served under s. 68(1)(b)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').
 
2.     Subsection 68(1)(b) of the Act, states that a Landlord
can give a further notice of termination to a tenant if within six months after a notice is given under section
62,64, or 67 has become void
an activity take place, conduct occurs or a situation arises that constitutes
grounds for a notice of termination under section 60, 61, 62, 64 or 67, other
than an activity, conduct or situation that is described in subsection 61(1)
and that involves an illegal act, trade, business, or occupation described in
clause 61(2)(a).
 
3.     The Landlord’s evidence was that the first notice of
termination N5 was served on September 4, 2020. The second N5 was served on March 9, 2021 which is more than six months after the first notice was
given. The second N5 purports to be a non-voidable notice of termination.




File Number: SOL-23673-21
 
4.    
S. 68(1)(b) does not permit a
landlord to serve a non-voidable second notice of termination more than six months after the first
notice was given.
The second notice
of termination is therefore invalid and this application based on this
invalid notice of termination cannot proceed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
