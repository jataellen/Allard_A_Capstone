Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-98203-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


101, 52 BAYSWATER PLACE KINGSTON ON K7M2C2


 




Between:


Osgoode Properties Ltd


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Luis Melo


Tenant



 
 
 
Osgoode Properties Ltd (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Luis Melo (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant,
another occupant of the rental
unit or someone the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or
another tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 956 0593 7653#
on January 26, 2022.
Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not provided the
Landlord with a copy of his liability insurance as required under
their tenancy agreement. The Landlord issued
letters to the Tenant
dated May 15, June 1 and June
22, 2021 requesting confirmation and proof of insurance which the Tenant has ignored. This conduct substantially interferes with a lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord.
 
2.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
3.    
The Landlord indicated the Tenant has provided confirmation of insurance in the past and
is seeking a conditional order. It’s reasonable to give the Tenant another
chance to provide proof of insurance in order to preserve his tenancy.
 
It is ordered that:




File Number: EAL-98203-21
 
1.    
The Tenant shall provide
to the Landlord a copy of his liability insurance on or before February 28, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February
12, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 13, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.    
If the Tenant fails to comply with paragraph one, the Landlord
may, without notice
to the Tenant, apply to the Board pursuant
to section 78 of the Act for an order, terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant.
