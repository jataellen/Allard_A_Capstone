Christina Mackey

Tenants



 
 
 
Galaxy Real Estate Core Ontario
Properties Lp (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Christina Mackey and Yousef Abdullah (the 'Tenants') and for an order
to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because
the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued
by the Board on December
3, 2021 with respect to application TEL-15855-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I
find that the Tenants have not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The
Tenants failed to pay the lawful monthly
rent in full, on or before January
1, 2022. The Tenants failed to pay $250.00 towards
the arrears, on or before January 1, 2022.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $2,997.10 for rent
arrears and NSF cheque charges and the costs related to the Landlord's
application fee in Order TEL-15855-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $2,997.10 and that amount
is included in this
order. As a result, the previous order TEL-15855-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from January 01, 2022 to January 31, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $892.41 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from November 3, 2020 to February 9, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TEL-15855-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 20, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlord $2,403.97*. This amount represents the rent owing up to February 9, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$29.98 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 10, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
20, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 21, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 20, 2022, then starting February
21, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 21, 2022.
 
 
February 9, 2022

The tenant has until February 19, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion

and the Board will schedule a hearing.
