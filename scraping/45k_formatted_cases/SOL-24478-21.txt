Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24478-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


3195 NIXON GATE BURLINGTON ON L7M0C6


 




Between:


Balil Sekhon


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Bobbie
Petrie


Tenant



 
 
 
Balil Sekhon (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Bobbie
Petrie (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on January 5, 2022. The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord served an
N12 notice to terminate the tenancy for the Landlord and Landlord’s parent’s on
June 16, 2021. The termination date in the N12 is September 5, 2021.
 
2.    
The N12 notice is
invalid. The Tenant testified that this is a month-to-month tenancy and the rent is due on the fifth of the month.
Submitted into evidence
was the lease agreement
stating that the lease start date was September 5, 2014. She also submitted
that the rent is due on the 5th of the month. The Landlord agreed that this
is a month-to-moth tenancy but waivered with respect the date the rent is due.
I prefer the Tenant’s evidence that the rent is due on the fifth, as her lease
start date is reflective of this and the Tenant was firm in the date her rent
is due.
 
3.     Section 48(2) of the Act states as follows:
 
(2) The date for termination
specified in the notice shall be at
least 60 days after the notice is given and shall be the day a period
of the tenancy ends or, where the tenancy
is for a fixed term, the end of the term.
 
4.    
Since the rent is due on the fifth
and this is a month-to-month tenancy, the fifth
cannot also be the day the
period ends. As such, the notice is invalid, and I cannot terminate the tenancy
based on the N12.
