Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-99114-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


33, 1600 BIRMINGHAM STREET CORNWALL ON K6H7A9


 




Between:


Cornwall & Area Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Corey Trudell Jessica Grandmaison


Tenants



 
 
 
Cornwall &
Area Housing Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Jessica Grandmaison and Corey Trudell (the 'Tenants') and for
an order to have the Tenants
pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on April 27, 2021
with respect to application EAL-92102-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenants have not met the following condition specified in the order: the Tenants did not pay the lawful
rent for December on or before December 1, 2021.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order
required the Tenants
to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenants
were ordered to pay $1,953.64 for rent arrears
in Order EAL-92102-20. The amount that is still owing from that order is $1,225.64 and
that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order
EAL-92102-20 is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenants
have failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from May 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.

It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The previous
order EAL-92102-20 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 25, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$1,801.55*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to December 31, 2021.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $28.50
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 1, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
25, 2022, the Tenants will start
to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from
January 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 25, 2022, then starting January
26, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 26, 2022.

The tenant has until January 24, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 24, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.
 
In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on July 26, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction
where the rental unit is located.
