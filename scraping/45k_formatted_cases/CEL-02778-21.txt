File Number: CEL-02778-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


412, 1440 BLOOR ST E MISSISSAUGA ON L4X1R5


 




Between:


Tapes Investment


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Jadwiga
Wasilewska Karol Wasilewski Marcin Wasilewski


Tenants



 
 
 
Tapes Investment (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jadwiga Wasilewska, Karol Wasilewski and
Marcin Wasilewski (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe. (L1 application)
 
The Landlord
also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants
because they have been persistently late in paying
their rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date. (L2 application)
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 6,
2022.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Bryan Rubin, attended the
hearing. As of 10:12 a.m., the Tenants
were not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from August
1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective August 25, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,273.31 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
3.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
1, 2021 to August 25, 2021.
 
4.    
The Tenants
paid $3,819.93 after
the application was filed.




 
5.    
Based on the
particulars contained in the N8 Notice of Eviction served to the Tenants on
August 31, 2021, I find that from February 2021 to August
31, 2021, the Tenant were late
paying the rent 7 months out of the 7-month period.
 
6.    
The Landlord’s Legal Representative advised
that the Landlord is seeking a standard 11- day voidable order for the arrears.
The last payment the Tenants made was on December 3, 2021 and it did not cover
the full rent. The Landlord is also seeking a standard 11-day eviction order
for the persistently late rent; the Tenants have continued paying late since
receiving the N8.
 
7.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction
subject to the condition(s) set out
in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. I accept
that a standard voidable order for the rental arrears is warranted as the
amount of arrears owing now exceeds the amount owing when the application was filed. With respect
to the persistently late payment
of rent application, if the
Tenants void the arrears order then, as this is a fairly long-term tenancy, they will be given the
opportunity to preserve the tenancy by paying the rent on time.
 
8.    
This order contains all the reasons
for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 21, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$1,729.17*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 10, 2022, less
the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $41.86
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 11, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
21, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from January 22,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 21, 2022, then starting January
22, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 22, 2022.




 
 
 
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 21, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $4,020.93** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after January
22, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
10.  If the Tenants
void the arrears
order by paying the amount owing in paragraph
8, then the Tenants shall pay the lawful rent to the Landlord in full
and on time for the period February 1, 2022 through January 1, 2023.
 
11.  If the Tenants fails to make any payments
in accordance with paragraph 1, the Landlord may apply under section
78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’) for an order
terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants, The Landlord must make the
application within 30 days of a breach of a condition set out in paragraph 10
of this order.
