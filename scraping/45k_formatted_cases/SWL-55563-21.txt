Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55563-21



In the
  matter of:


933 MCKAY AVENUE WINDSOR ON N9B2A4


 




Between:


Patricia Guthrie


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Nicole Beaumont


 
Tenant



 
 
Patricia Guthrie (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Nicole Beaumont (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 20, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Kira Passell, attended
the hearing. As of 10:15
a.m. the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period
from August 1, 2020 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 24, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
3.    
The lawful monthly rent as of January 1, 2022 is
$1,034.26.
4.    
The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed.
5.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,000.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 1, 2018 to September 24, 2021.
 
7.     
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with section 83 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19
on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 20, 2022.
 
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $4,473.84*, which represents the
amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
9, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$34.00 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 10, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 20, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 21, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 20, 2022, then starting February
21, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 21, 2022.
 
8.     
If, on or before February 20,
2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $6,414.52** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and
the Tenant could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 21, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
 
February 9, 2022 Date Issued
South West-RO
150 Dufferin Avenue, Suite
400, 4th Floor London ON N6A5N6
