In the matter
of:


303, 219 HAMPTON AVENUE SARNIA ON N7S4Y7


 




Between:


Sireg Management Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Dylan Young


Tenant



 
 
Sireg Management Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order terminating the tenancy
of Dylan Young (the 'Tenant')
and evicting the Tenant because he has abandoned the rental unit.
 
This application was heard via video conference on January 24, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord’s Representative Navya Menon and the Landlord’s On-Site Manager, Andrew Pavie attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.     I find on a balance
of probabilities that the Tenant has abandoned the rental unit.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s On-Site Manager,
Andrew Pavie (‘A.P.”) discovered on
or about September 30, 2021 that the Tenant appeared to have abandoned the
rental unit. The rental unit was
inspected at that time by A.P. who found belongings consisting of items such as clothing, linens,
cleaning supplies and toys stacked
up into piles in the middle of rooms and also scattered throughout the
unit, a mattress propped up against the wall, dishes in the sink and rotten
food in the fridge. Photographs were
taken and shown at the hearing which depict the condition of the rental unit as
at September 30, 2021.
 
3.     The state of affairs pertaining to the rental unit has
not changed as at the hearing date. On or about January 20, 2022, A.P. entered
the rental unit and took photos depicting the condition of the rental
unit. Between September
30, 2021 and January 20, 2022, nothing has changed and the items in the
photographs appear to have been untouched.
 
4.     The Landlord has made reasonable efforts to contact
the Tenant. Neighbours to the Tenant
have stated that the Tenant has left the rental unit. The Landlord has sent correspondence to the tenant on October 5,
2021, December 20, 2021 and January 3, 2022 and has received no response. The Landlord has made numerous
phonecalls to

the Tenant and has received no
response. The mailbox to the rental
unit, which is outdoors and affixed
by each individual unit, was full with mail for a long period of time but is now empty. A.P. testified that he did not know if
somebody emptied it, or the contents fell out.
The Tenant left no forwarding address, and the Landlord has been unable
to contact the Tenant to confirm that the unit has been abandoned.
 
5.     The rent is in arrears.
Evidence at the hearing indicated that no rent payments
have been made since July 5, 2021 with rent being due on the first of
every month.
 
6.     This order contains
all of the reasons in this matter and no further reasons
will be issued.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant has abandoned the rental unit.
 
2.     The Tenant shall
pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing on or before
February 28, 2022, he will
start to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.

Date Issued
 
South West-RO
150 Dufferin Avenue, Suite 400, 4th Floor
