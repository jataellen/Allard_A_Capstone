Galaxy Value Add Ontario
Properties LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Roger
Johns (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 18, 2022. Only
the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Gail Kukor Lang, attended the hearing. As
of 3:00 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 29, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent for the unit increased to $1,028.95.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,016.75 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period from January 1, 2021 to September 29, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $3,003.50 after the application was filed.
 
Landlord's Legal Representative Submissions
 
7.    
The Landlord's Legal Representative gave oral testimony that she had been contacted
by the Tenant before the hearing and the Tenant Roger Johns, was unable
to attend the haring due to work obligations.




File Number: SOL-25250-21
 
8.    
The Landlord's Legal Representative gave oral testimony that she was able to submit a Standard Order with an extended
termination date of February 28, 2022, based on payment attempts and
communication with the Tenant.
 
9.    
I have considered the request by
the Landlord's Legal Representative to extend the termination date and I have
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a
repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it
would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
the Act.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $709.80*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
26, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $33.43
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 27, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 28, 2022, then starting
March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
8.     If
the Tenant wishes
to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$2,061.70 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$3,090.65 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph
and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after March
1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is




File Number: SOL-25250-21
 
only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
