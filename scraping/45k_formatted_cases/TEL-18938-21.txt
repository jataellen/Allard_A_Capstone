Tenant



 
 
 
Blauson Assets Management (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dardhge
Veira (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying
the Tenant's rent. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the
termination date (L2 application).
 
Blauson Assets Management (the 'Landlord') also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Dardhge Veira (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that
the Tenant owes (L1 application).
 
 
This application was heard by video conference
on December 14, 2021.
 
At 1:45 pm the Landlord’s Representative Cathy Corsetti (CC) attended the hearing.
 
On the date of the hearing
CC indicated that the Tenant had paid the arrears and requested
consent of the Board to withdraw the L1 application.
 
CC also said the Landlord is not seeking
eviction and requests a pay on time order from the Board based on the N8/L2 application.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
2.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1876.60.
 
3.     The Tenant paid all arrears
owing to the Landlord on or about December 2021.

owing from the Landlord in the amount of $108.37.
