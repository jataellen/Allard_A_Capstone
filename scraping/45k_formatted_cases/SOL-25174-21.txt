Neil Williams


Tenant



 
 
 
The Effort
Trust Company (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Neil Williams (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent
the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the
order issued by the Board on September 28, 2021 with respect to application
SOL-21879-21. The matter was directed to hearing.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Kimberley Holleran, attended the hearing. As of 1:53 p.m., the Tenant was not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.    
The hearing
order dated September
28, 2021 indicates at paragraph 7:
 
At the hearing
the Landlord's Legal Representative explained that the Tenant had signed-in to the hearing
earlier, but got disconnected. They had reached
a payment agreement and
intended on requesting an order made on consent of both parties.
The Landlord's
Legal Representative further explained that the Tenant receives a pension
following a workplace accident. The Landlord was willing ot give him a chance to rectify his outstanding arrears.
They agreed on a repayment
plan over 18 months where the Tenant would pay
$1,000.00 on the first of every month in addition to paying his monthly rent.




File Number: SOL-25174-21
 
3.    
The hearing order was
written based on the Landlord's Legal Representative’s submission and ordered
that the Tenant was to pay the arrears starting November 1, 2021 through March 1, 2021
in the amount of $1,000.00
per month, and the final
arrears payment of $931.00
o April 1, 2023. The order also indicated that the lawful
monthly rent was to be paid
in full and on time November 2021 through April 2023. The section 78 breach
clause was attached to all terms.
 
4.    
The Landlord's Legal Representative
submitted that the Tenant breached by not paying September and October rent in
full and on time, only $117.00 was paid towards September; the monthly rent is $883.00.
Although September and October are not part of
the terms indicated in the hearing order, paragraph 3(a) under “It is ordered”
encompasses these months because the breach clause includes “the payment of any
new arrears…not ordered under paragraph 1”. The Representative submitted that
this is the only logical interpretation of the order otherwise the Landlord is
left without remedy if the months of September and October remain unpaid.
 
5.    
I understand the
Representative’s concern with the Landlord not having remedy unless the order is interpreted in the way she set forth, however,
the preamble to the paragraph she refers to says “If the
Tenant fails to make any of the payments in accordance with paragraph 2, and by
the dates required” then clauses (a) and (b) apply.
 
6.    
As a breach can only be based on conditions in the order, and September
and October are not included
in the order, the Landlord’s application must be dismissed.
 
7.    
To correct
what appears to be an oversight in the hearing
order, a to request to amend
the order or a request to review the order would have to be made.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1. The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
