509, 1785 BASELINE ROAD OTTAWA ON K2C0C2


 




Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Florence
Morgan Nicholas Morgan


Tenants



 
 
1167750 Ontario
Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Nicholas Morgan and Florence Morgan (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have
the Tenants pay the rent they owe because
the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by
the Board on August 10, 2021 with respect to application EAL-95175-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenants
if the Tenants did not meet certain
condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenants have not met the following condition specified in the order: the Tenants did not pay the lawful
rent for December on or before December 1, 2021.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order
required the Tenants
to pay rent or some or all of the arrears
of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to
request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenants were
ordered to pay $3,911.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the
Landlord's application fee in Order EAL-95175-21. The amount that is still owing from that
order is $1,147.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order EAL-95175-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenants
have failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from October 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.
 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,774.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.




File Number: EAL-99140-21
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from November
13, 2020 to January 17, 2022.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The previous
order EAL-95175-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 28, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$1,942.21*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to December 31, 2021 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $58.32
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 1, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before
January 28, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 29, 2022.

The tenant has until January 27, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 27, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.
 
In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on July 29, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction
where the rental unit is located.
