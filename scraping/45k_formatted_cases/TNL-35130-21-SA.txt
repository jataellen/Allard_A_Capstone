In the matter
of:


48 MAE BROOKS DRIVE NEWMARKET ON L3X3G8


 




Between:


Wang Lai Wammy
Ngan Kwong Shun Tso


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Mark Kenneth Pereira Mylene Mae Carino


Tenants



 
 
Wang Lai Wammy Ngan and Kwong
Shun Tso (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Mark
Kenneth Pereira and Mylene Mae Carino (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe
because the Tenants failed to meet a
condition specified in the order issued by the Board on July 19, 2021 with
respect to application TNL- 31248-21.
 
The Landlords' application was resolved
by order TNL-35130-21, issued on November
2, 2021. The Tenants filed a
motion to set aside order TNL-35130-21.
 
This motion
was heard by videoconference on January 6,
2022.
 
The second-named Landlord and the first-named Tenant attended the hearing.
also in attendance was the Landlord’s interpreter between the English
and Cantonese languages Angel Liu. AL indicated that she was also the
Landlord’s real-estate agent but was not being paid for her services at the
hearing and appeared as the Landlord’s friend solely to translate.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
At the hearing, the
Tenant agreed he breached the terms of order TNL-31248-21 as alleged by the
Landlord. He failed to pay the arrears of $10,000.00 in full on or before
August 12, 2021 and $7,248.00 in full on or before
September 12, 2021. He also failed to pay the rent for the months of August
2021 and September 2021 in full and on time.
 
2.    
This means that the issue is whether or not the Board is satisfied, having
regard to all the
circumstances, that it would not be unfair to set aside the eviction order.
(See: s. 78(11)(b) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').)
 
3.    
This tenancy
began approximately seven years ago. The monthly
rent is $2,218.00
and is due on the first of
each month.




 
4.    
The Tenant
testified that he breached the order because of unanticipated
health issues he faced, resulting in
him getting sick, not working on a full-time basis and after a final diagnosis, not working at all based on the doctor’s order.
However, during this time, the Tenant made what payments he could.
 
5.    
Since then, however, he
has received treatment and clearance to go back to work as normal and seeks a
chance to preserve his tenancy. The Tenant testified that he lives in the rental
unit with his spouse and their three
children ages 11,13, and
14. He states that he is
able to pay the arrears aggressively over the next five months and proposes a
repayment plan whereby he would pay the rent on time and an additional
$3,155.35 on the 15th of each month commencing February 15, 2022
until the arrears are paid in full.
6.    
The Landlord requests
that the Tenant’s motion be denied, and the stay be lifted immediately as he has no faith
in the Tenants’ ability to pay the arrears since
the Tenants have always
broken their promises. The Landlord believes this is yet another delay tactic
on the Tenants’ part.
 
ANALYSIS
 
7.    
The parties
appeared before the Board
in July 2021 and a repayment plan was ordered by the Board. I find that the Tenant breached the repayment plan due to circumstances
beyond his control, namely, the health issues he faced resulting in him
getting severely sick. Moving
forward, the Tenant’s financial circumstances has improved as his wife is
working as he will be returning back to work.
 
8.    
The arrears
in July 2021 totaled $17,248.00; the arrears as of the hearing date total
$15,776.77. I find that the Tenants
have been making efforts to pay down the arrears.
 
9.    
Given the above, I find
that it would not be unfair to grant the Tenants a final opportunity to preserve
the tenancy and repay the debt to the Landlord.
As such, the Tenant’s motion to set aside order TNL-35130-21 is
granted and replaced with his proposed repayment plan.
 
10.  This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The motion
to set aside Order TNL-35130-21, issued on November

with the following order.
 
3.    
The arrears
and costs owing
to January 31, 2022 total
$15,776.77.
 
4.

shall pay to the Landlord
$15,776.77 as follows:
 
a)

5.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord the lawful monthly
rent as it comes due in full

6.    
If the Tenants fail to
make any one of the payments in accordance with this order, the Landlord may,
without notice to the Tenants and within 30 days of the breach, apply to the
Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and
evicting the Tenants and requiring that the Tenants
pay any new arrears, NSF fees and related charges that became owing
after January 31, 2022.
