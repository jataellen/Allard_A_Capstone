Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-99711-21
 
 
In the matter of:      LOWER UNIT B, 948 EWART
STREET
INNISFIL ON L0L1C0
 




Between:                  Darren Cunliffe Erin Comeau


Landlords




 
 
and
 




Kathleen Costigan William (Bill)
Midghall


Tenants




 
 
Darren Cunliffe
and Erin Comeau
(the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Kathleen Costigan and William
(Bill) Midghall (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 24, 2022. The Landlord, Erin Comeau, the Landlords' Legal Representative, Nicole Fazzarri, and the Tenant,
William (Bill) Midghall,
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the
total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from February 1, 2021 to October
31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective April 8, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,225.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
Section 83
 
6.    
The Tenant proposed to pay an additional $500.00 on top of the
monthly rent to pay the arrears.
This proposal would have the arrears paid in full in just over 28 months. The
Tenant testified that he lost everything in January 2021 when his shop caught
fire. Since then he has been
struggling. He expects to start a new job in February 2022 where he




File Number: CEL-99711-21
 
will be earning $2,200.00 to $2,500.00 per month. The Landlord opposed
the Tenant’s proposed payment
plan.
 
7.     After considering submissions from the parties, I do
not find that Tenant will follow through on his proposal given his actions. I say this because the Tenant has not made a payment to the Landlord since
February 2021. The parties came before the Board previously and the matter
was adjourned. The Tenant failed
to abide by the interim order issued by the Board requiring him to pay ongoing rent to the Landlord pending
resolution of the application.
 
8.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 11, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $14,147.65*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 31, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlords
$40.27 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 1, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before February
11, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 12, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 11, 2022, then starting
February 12, 2022, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 12, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenants
wish to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlords or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$14,261.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$15,486.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 11, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not make full
payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline,
then the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.




File Number: CEL-99711-21
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 12, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during
the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
