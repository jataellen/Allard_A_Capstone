Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: EAL-98267-21
 
 
In the matter of:      110, 87 COMPTON
STREET
KINGSTON ON K7K5Z3
 
Between:                  Skyline Living                                    Landlord
 
 
and
 
Joshua Cronkwright                                                                                                                  Tenant
 
Skyline Living (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Joshua Cronkwright (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February
1, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Andelina Andreita, attended the hearing. As of 12:15 p.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
September 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective October 14, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,438.78.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,348.75 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     The Tenant paid $5,716.34 after the application was filed.
 
6.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find
that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 28, 2022
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.

2.    
As of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit exceeds
the arrears of rent
and compensation the Landlord is entitled to by $726.86*.
 
3.     However, the Landlord
is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenant: $47.30
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February
12, 2022 to the
date the Tenant
moves out of the unit,
and $186.00 for the cost of
filing the application.
 
4.     The Landlord
or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 28, 2022, then starting
March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
7.     If, on or before February 28, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $1,663.56** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after March
1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
