Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-99213-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


37, 255 METCALFE STREET OTTAWA ON K2P1R4


 




Between:


255 Metcalfe Street Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Yvon Cadieux


Tenant



 
 
 
255 Metcalfe Street Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Yvon Cadieux
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order
issued by the Board on December 14, 2021 with respect to application
EAL-93037-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The previous application before the Board
sought termination of the tenancy
based on the Tenant’s
persistent late payment of rent.
 
2.     The previous order
required the Tenant
to make payment to the Landlord on or before
the first day of each month.
 
3.     The order specifically stipulates, “If the first day of the month falls on the weekend or a
statutory/civic holiday, the Tenant must pay the lawful monthly rent in full
the next business day following the weekend or holiday”.
 
4.    
The Landlord’s affidavit states,
“The Tenant’s rent came due January 1, 2022. The Tenant did not pay until January 4,
2022”.
 
5.    
January 1, 2022 fell on a Saturday, and the statutory holiday was taken
on January 3, 2021. Meaning that the Tenant complied
with the order making payment in full on January 4, 2022, the first business
day following the holiday.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application under section 78 of the Act is dismissed.
