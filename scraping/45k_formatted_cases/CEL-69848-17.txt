Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: CEL-69848-17
 











 



 


 


 



 

J I L (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict F A (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did
not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (L1 Application).
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because she has been persistently
late in paying her rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date (L2 Application).
 
This application was heard in Mississauga
on October 26, 2017.
 
The Landlord's Agent,
B. S and the Tenant’s Agent A. I M attended the hearing.
 
Determinations and
Reasons:
 
Regarding L1 rent
owing application
 
1.     
The monthly rent is
$1,250.66.
2.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent she was required to pay for the period from July 1, 2017 to October
31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective August 18, 2017.
3.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,250.66 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
4.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2017 to August 18, 2017.
5.     
The Tenant paid $900.00
after the application was filed.
6.     
The amount of rent owing is
not in dispute.
 
Regarding L2 persistent late rent application
7.     
On August 8, 2017 the
Landlord gave the Tenant an N8 notice of termination pursuant to subsection
58(1)(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2006 (the 'Act').  The notice
is effective October 31, 2017 and alleges that the Tenant persistently paid
rent late.
8.     
The Tenant persistently paid
rent late.  Rent is due on the 1st day of each month.  The Tenant
paid rent late ten times out of the last ten months.  The Landlord submitted a
copy of a rent ledger which confirms the payment dates as set out in the N8
notice.
Relief from
eviction
9.     
The Landlord seeks final
termination of the tenancy. She said that there have been prior Board
applications, she is experiencing financial difficulties because of unpaid rent
and the associated administrative costs and that she has given the Tenant many
chances since 2011.
10.   The Landlord's Agent seeks an opportunity to
continue the tenancy.  He said the amount owing could be paid by October 31,
2017.  He testified that the Tenant, his mother, is elderly and in receipt of
ODSP benefits.  He said he can be more involved with the Tenant to ensure that
rent is paid on the 1st day of each month going forward.
11.   I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it
would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the conditions
set out in this order pursuant to subsections 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. The tenancy is
eight years in length and the Tenant is able to repay the arrears in a short
amount of time.  To balance the prejudice to the Landlord, the Tenant is
required to void the rent arrears portion of the order to benefit from a
condition to pay the rent on time with a section 78 provision where the
Landlord can file for eviction if a payment of rent is late without notice to
the Tenants. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before November
10, 2017.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $1,630.06*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to October 30, 2017, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $41.12 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
October 31, 2017 to the date she moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before November 10, 2017, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
November 11, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before November 10, 2017, then starting November 11, 2017, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after November 11, 2017.
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, she must pay to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust:
i)        $2,112.64 if the payment is made on or before October 31, 2017, or
ii)       $3,363.30 if the payment is made on or before November 10, 2017**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after November 11, 2017 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
L2 persistent late
rent application:
 
10.   If the Tenant pays the amount required to void
the rent arrears portion of this order, then the tenancy will continue subject
to the following condition:
(a)  The Tenant shall pay the Landlord the full monthly rent on or before
the first day of each month for a twelve month period commencing December 1,
2017 through to and including November 1, 2018.
11.   If the Tenant fails to make any one of the payments
ordered in paragraph 10, in full and on time, the Landlord may apply under
section 78 of the Act, without notice to the Tenant for an order terminating
the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord must make this application no
later than 30 days after the Tenant’s failure to make a payment.
