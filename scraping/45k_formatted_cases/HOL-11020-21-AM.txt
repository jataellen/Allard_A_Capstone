AMENDED ORDER
Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
And section 21.1 of the Statutory Powers
Procedure Act
 
File Number: HOL-11020-21-AM
 



In the matter
of:


144 STORMONT TRAIL WOODBRIDGE ON L4H3W7


 




Between:


Parintaj Ankleshvria


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Beverly Harper Christopher Howell Priscilla Xymines


Tenants



 
 
The order is amended and issued
to correct the issuance date in the original order January 4, 2022. This change affects
the total amount
of rent owing, the enforcement date with the sheriff,
and the date at which interest will accrue. The amended order also includes a
clerical error to include the Tenant arriving at the hearing after the block
had ended. All changes have been underlined for ease of reading.
 
Parintaj Ankleshvria (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Beverly Harper,
Christopher Howell and Priscilla Xymines
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the
rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 7, 2021.
Only the Landlord’s Agent,
Marshall Yarmus, attended the hearing. As of 2:13 p.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
Tenant Duty Counsel York Region
entered the hearing
room, with the Tenant at 4:13pm to inform
me the Tenant had issues calling in the hearing. I informed the Tenant that
file had been heard uncontested.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay
for the period from May 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective June 23, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $4,400.00.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.




File Number: HOL-11020-21-AM
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $4,400.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from September 1, 2020 to June 23,
2021.
 
7.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 4, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$34,425.44*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 24, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $144.66
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 25,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing*
on or before February 4,
2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February
5, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 4, 2022,
then starting February 5, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 5, 2022.
 
8.     If
the Tenants wish to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)          
$39,786.00 if the payment
is made on or before January 31, 2022, or
ii)         
$44,186.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 4, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not
make full payment in
accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.




File Number: HOL-11020-21-AM
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 5, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to
the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
