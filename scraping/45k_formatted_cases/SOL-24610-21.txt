Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24610-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


201, 7170 BRUCE AVENUE NIAGARA FALLS
ON L2G7N6


 




Between:


Lyndon Place Apartments Limited


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Mary Cockburn


Tenant



 
 
 
Lyndon Place
Apartments Limited (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Mary Cockburn (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent; and because the
Tenant no longer qualifies to live in the rental unit. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 956 0593 7653#
on January 5, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord and the Landlord’s Representatives, Kee Fung Anthony Ho and F. McGregor
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due. The
Tenant has paid rent late 8
times from January 1, 2021 to August 1, 2021.
 
2.    
After the N8 Notice was
issued, the Tenant also failed to pay any rent charges from September 2021 to January
2022. The Landlord
requested per diem compensation after the date of termination on the N8
Notice as also requested on the L2 application. The Tenant owes per diem
compensation starting December 1, 2021 to the date the Tenant vacates the
rental unit.
 
3.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated, as of January 22, 2022.
The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before January 22, 2022.

2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$2,502.74, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from December 1, 2021
to January 11, 2022.
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord
$59.59 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from January 12, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before January
22, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 23, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 22, 2022, then starting January
23, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 23, 2022.
