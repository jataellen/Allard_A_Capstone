Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44105-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


3, 580 MAIN STREET E NORTH BAY ON P1B1B8


 




Between:


Desmond Green


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


George
  Kebokee


Tenant



 
 
 
Desmond Green
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict George
Kebokee (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit
or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully caused
undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage; and because
the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or a person the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex has seriously impaired the safety of any
person. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 988 4914 7021# on January
10, 2022. Only the
Landlord attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord
testified that the Tenant is continually throwing
garbage, furniture and needles off his balcony.
 
2.    
Photographs submitted by the Landlord
show extensive damage to the rental unit including multiple holes in doors,
walls, and door frames pulled apart.
 
3.    
The Landlord
personally witnessed the Tenant selling
drugs from the rental unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant was warned
not to pile garbage in an area under the fire escape.
The Tenant continued to pile
excess garbage which caught fire and caused in excess of $5,000.00 damage.
 
5.    
I find the Tenant
has wilfully caused
undue damage to the rental
unit and the residential
complex.




 
6.    
The Landlord
will incur costs
of $5,000.00 to repair the damage and replace property
that was damaged and cannot be reasonably repaired.
 
7.    
The date this order requires the Tenant to move out is before
the termination date set out in the notice of termination given by
the Landlord
 
8.    
I find the Tenant
has also has seriously impaired
the safety of other persons
by causing a fire and this act or omission occurred
in the residential complex.
 
9.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $800.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
10.  Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period from September 1, 2018 to October 30,
2021
 
11. 
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated, as of January
18, 2022. The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before January 18, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$5,000.00, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage and
replacing the damaged property.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$1,139.51, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from October 31, 2021
to January 13, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$26.30 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from January 14, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
6.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
January 18, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from January 19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
7.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January
19, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.    
Upon receipt of this
order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after
January 19, 2022. The Sheriff
is requested to expedite the enforcement of this order.
