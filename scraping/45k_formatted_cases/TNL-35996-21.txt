Shi-Ronni Tynes                                                                                                                 Tenant
 
 
 
On November 23, 2021, Joseph Eze and 1992480 Ontario
Inc (the 'Landlords') applied in this L4
application for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Shi-Ronni Tynes (the 'Tenant')
and for an order to have the
Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a
condition specified in the consent order issued by the Board on October 25, 2021
with respect to L1 application
TNL-33563-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The previous consent order
provided that the Landlords could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet
certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I find that the Tenant has not met
the following condition specified in the order: The Tenant failed to pay the
lawful monthly rent in full on or before November 5, 2021, which was a breach
of paragraph 2(a) of the consent order. This L4 application was filed within 30 days of the breach.
 
3.       
The previous L1 application
included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The
resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears
of rent. Accordingly, in addition
to eviction, the Landlords are entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation in this L4 application.
 
4.       
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$9,986.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in previous
consent order TNL-33563-21. The Tenant failed
to make any payments she agreed to pay
from the prior consent order, so the amount that is still
owing from that order is $9,986.00, which is
included in this order.
As a result, the previous consent order TNL-33563-21
is cancelled.




 
5.       
Since the date of the consent
order, the Tenant
has failed to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from November
1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.
 
6.       
On April 1, 2021, the Landlords
collected a rent deposit of $2,400.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still being held by the Landlords.
 
7.       
There was no guideline rent increase allowed
(and consequently no interest on deposit)
for 2021 due to COVID19.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
Prior consent order TNL-33563-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlords
and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before January
15, 2022 (standard 11 days from the
issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
If the Tenant made any payments
to the Landlords after this L4 application was filed,
those amounts shall be deducted from the calculations below.
 
4.       
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlords $12,747.64*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 4, 2022 (the issuance date of this order) and the costs related to the
application fee for the previous L1 application, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
5.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the
Landlords $78.90 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
January 5, 2022 to the date the Tenant actually
moves out of the rental unit or gets evicted.
 
6.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before January
15, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 16, 2022 at .00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlords may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after January 16, 2022.
 
 
January 4, 2022

The tenant has until January 14, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 14, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on July 16, 2022 if the order has not been
filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that
has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
