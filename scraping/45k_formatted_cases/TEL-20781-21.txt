William Hodgins and New York
Toning & Tanning (can) Inc (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Gage Sweeting (the 'Tenant') because
they intend to do major repairs or renovations to the
rental unit.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on January 25, 2022.
 
The Landlord, William Hodgins
and the Tenant
Gage Sweeting attended
the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
Preliminary Issue:
 
1.       
The Landlord served the Tenant with an N13 Notice to end the tenancy because
the Landlord is required to do repairs.
 
2.       
The N13 Notice filed with
the Board has a termination date of April 30, 2020 and the Notice is signed by the Landlord on
January 28, 2020.
 
3.       
At the hearing, the Landlord
testified that he served the Tenant with a more recent N13 Notice but that he
did not file it with the Board. At
the hearing, the Landlord could not locate the more recent form he
was referring to, to provide
to the Board at the time of the
hearing.
 
4.       
The Tenant testified that he did not receive
a more recent copy of the N13 Notice and that the only copy he has is the Notice with the termination
date of April 30, 2020.

5.       
Section 50 (2) of the Act, provides that the date for
termination specified in the notice shall be at least 120 days after
the notice is given.
 
6.       
Because the Landlord failed
to comply with Section 50 (2) of Act, the Landlord did not
provide 120 days notice to the Tenant, the Landlord’s Notice is defective.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The Landlords' application is dismissed.
 
February 16, 2022
