On January 12, 2022 Jessica Lapkowski and Amiraco Properties Inc (the 'Landlords') applied in this L4
application for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Belinda Macdonald
(the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant
pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the consent order issued by the Board
on December 8, 2021 with respect to L1 application SWL-54192-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The previous consent order
provided that the Landlords could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the
Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I find that the Tenant has not met
the following condition specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $4800.80 arrears
on or before December 31, 2021 which was a breach of the consent order. This L4
application was filed within 30 days of the breach.
 
3.       
The previous L1 application
included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The
resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears
of rent. Accordingly, in addition
to eviction, in this L4 application the Landlords are entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenant agreed was ordered to pay $4,800.80
for rent arrears
and the costs related to the Landlord's L1 application fee in
previous consent order SWL-54192-21. The Tenant failed to make any payments
towards that order, so the amount that is still owing from that order is $4,800.80 and that amount is included in
this order. As a result, the previous consent order SWL-54192-21 is
cancelled.




 
5.       
Since the date of the consent
order, the Tenant
has failed to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from January
1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.
 
6.       
On December 1, 2020 the Landlords collected a rent deposit of $1,100.00 from the
Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlords.
 
7.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenant for the period from the
time of collection, December 1, 2020
to this order issuance date, January 25, 2022.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.       
The previous consent order SWL-54192-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlords
and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before February
5, 2022 (standard 11 days from the issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
If the Tenant made any payments
to the Landlords after this L4 application was filed,
those amounts shall be deducted from the calculations below.
 
See attached
Summary of Calculations
 
4.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords
$4,651.89*. This amount represents the rent owing up to this order date,
January 25, 2022 and
the costs related to the application fee for
the previous L1 application, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
5.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $38.19 per day for
compensation for the use
of the unit starting January 26, 2022 to the date the Tenant actually moves out
of the rental unit or gets evicted.
 
6.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before February
5, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 6, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 5, 2022, then starting February
6, 2022, the Landlords may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after February 6, 2022.
