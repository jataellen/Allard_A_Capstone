Tenants




 
On November
17, 2021, Muhammad
Khalid (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jason Evanhelista,
Duneep Khaira-Evanhelista, Renata Mauro and Gino Evanhelista (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the
Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board
on September 13, 2021 with respect to application CEL-97179-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenants have not met the following condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenants failed to pay to the Landlord
$1,500.00 on or before October
20, 2021 towards arrears of
rent.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenants were
ordered to pay $6,986.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the
Landlord's application fee in Order CEL-97179-20. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $4,211.00 and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous
order CEL-97179-20 is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenants have also
failed to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from
November 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.




 
6.    
The Landlord
applied the last month rent deposit
of $2,300.00 towards October rent since the Tenants advised the
Landlord that they will be ending the tenancy as of November 3, 2021 and the
Tenants did not vacate the unit accordingly.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order CEL-97179-20 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated as of January
7, 2022. The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before January 18, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$6,311.00*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to November 30, 2021 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $72.33
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting December 1, 2021
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
18, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 19,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January
19, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 19, 2022.
 
8.    
The tenant has until January 17, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order
under s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 17, 2022 the order will be stayed, and the Board
will schedule a hearing.
 
9.    
In accordance with
section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires
on July 19, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with
the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental
unit is located.
