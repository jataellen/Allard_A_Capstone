Margaret Lee and Michael Cheong
(the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Afsana Kawsar and Mohammad Kawsar (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
entered into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    The
Tenants provided the Landlord with a Tenant’s Notice to End the Tenancy (N9
Form). The N9 Form proposed to terminate the tenancy as of October 13, 2021.
The Landlords accepted the Tenant’s N9 Form and agreed to terminate the tenancy
as of October 13, 2021. The Tenants
did not move out of the
rental unit by the termination date that had been agreed to.
 
It
is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 18, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlords
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlords the full amount owing on or before January 17, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 18, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
4.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January
19, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
