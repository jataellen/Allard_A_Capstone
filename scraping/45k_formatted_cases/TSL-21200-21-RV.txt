Tenant



 
 
Review Order
 
Gabriela Oliveros
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Jason Sheppard (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved by order TSL-21200-21 issued on August
4, 2021. On August 31, 2021,
the Landlord requested a review of the order.
On September
13, 2021, interim
order TSL-21200-21-RV-IN was issued staying
the order dated August 4, 2021.
 
The request was heard by videoconference on December 14, 2021.
The Landlord, G. Oliveros and the Tenant attended the hearing.
The Tenant
provided disclosed documents to both the Landlord and the Board that he intends
to rely on in support of his section
82 issues but the Landlord
claimed she did not receive
it. She did not challenge the Tenant’s claim that he sent her text
messages and several pictures. The Landlord did not want an adjournment to
prepare. The Tenant was asked to
describe and enter evidence as it relates to context but he did not reference
specific documents or photographs during the course of his testimony.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord stated she
did not receive the Notice of Hearing. The Board’s record does not confirm
whether the Notice of Hearing
was mailed or emailed to either the Landlord or her representative.
 
2.      
I am satisfied that due to an administrative error, a serious
error occurred in procedure.




 
3.    
Since it appears to be the Board’s error,
the Board shall refund the Landlord $58.00
for the cost of having to file the review.
 
4.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the
Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
March 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective March 19,
2021.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $650.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
The Landlord cannot apply the last month rent deposit to any other rent period other than last
month rent deposit.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from November 2, 2018
to March 19, 2021.
 
7.    
The Tenant paid $1,670.00
after the application was filed which includes
the Tenant’s payment made on June 2, 2020 of $685.00
which the Landlord
initially challenged but later accepted.
 
8.    
Both parties confirmed
the Tenant made a $500.00 payment to the Landlord in March 2020. This amount was not reflected on the L1
application which I amended, therefore the amount owing to March 29, 2020 inclusive
of the application fee is $5,246.00. The Landlord’s error on the L1 application
was not made on the N4 Notice.
 
Section 82:
 
9.    
The Tenant raised
pursuant to s.82 issues alleging the Landlord interfered with his reasonable
enjoyment of the rental unit by not addressing the noise from the stray cat
living in the residential complex; the Landlord’s superintendent harassed the
Tenant by intentionally smoking cigarettes in front of his rental unit; and
failed to meet her maintenance obligations under section 20 of the Act to eradicate cockroaches, mice and rats in the
rental unit.
 
10.  The issues related
to the cat occurred during the first 13 months
of his tenancy which was around November 2018 to December 2019.
 
11. 
The problems
with superintendent harassing the Tenant occurred
from November 2018 to June 2020 when the
superintendent’s employment ended.
 
12.  The Board is statute barred and cannot
consider the Tenant’s claim on these issues due to the one-year limitation
period imposed by the Act. Section 29(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the ‘Act’) provides
that a Tenant may apply for an order if the day of
the alleged conduct giving rise to the application occurred
less than one year.
The Tenant issues are out of time.
 
13.  There was not enough evidence to understand
the scope of the cockroach problem, specifically, when it was reported to the Landlord
and what measures
the Landlord took to eradicate the problem despite
several attempts at guiding the Tenant back to this issues. The Tenant
indicated the Landlord did nothing and the Landlord refuted his




 
testimony that that the complex was treated. There wasn’t enough
evidence presented by the Tenant to meet the burden of proof
required to prove the Landlord ignored her maintenance obligation after the
cockroach problem was reported.
 
14.  The Tenant also testified there were mice in the rental unit since November
2018 on and off but did not provide
enough evidence such as dates
and other details. The mice issue seems to be related to a
problem with garbage which the Landlord indicated was corrected.
 
15.  The Tenant reported the presence of rats in
mid summer 2021 to the Landlord. The Landlord
superintendent laid traps and the Tenant stopped
seeing rats around the end of
October 2021. Based on the Tenant’s evidence, the issue appears to be resolved.
 
16.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
The Tenant indicated that he has no money to pay rent or the outstanding
arrears. A payment plan will not
preserve this tenancy. To delay or
deny eviction under the circumstances given the Tenant has made no payments
after June 2021 would be unfair to the Landlord.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TSL-21200-21
issued on August 5, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the following: Unless the
Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before January 16, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$9,032.41*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 5,
2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit and less the amount of the {abatement/rebate} the Landlord owes the Tenant.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $22.52
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 6, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January
17, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 17, 2022.
 
7.    
If, on or before
January 16, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $10,426.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would
not be terminated and the Tenant could
remain in the unit. If this payment




 
is not made in full and on time,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.    
The Tenant may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after January
17, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant
is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
 
9.    
The Board shall refund
the Landlord $58.00
for the cost of filing
the review application.
