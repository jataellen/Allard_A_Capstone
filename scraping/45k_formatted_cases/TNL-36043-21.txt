Bruno Braga

Tenants




 
 
 
On November 5, 2021, Gaspar
Investments Holdings Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied in this L4 application for
an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Bruno Braga and Lee-ann Aitchinson (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants
pay the rent they owe because
the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the consent order issued by the Board on October
4, 2021 with respect to L1
application TNL-33148-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The consent order provided
that the Landlord
could apply to the Board under section
78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without
notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the
Tenants did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I find that the Tenants have not
met the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenants failed to pay $671.00 towards
arrears on or before October
24, 2021. The Tenants also failed to pay the lawful monthly rent in full on or before November 1, 2021. These were breaches of
paragraphs 1 and 2 of the consent order. This L4 application was filed within
30 days of the breaches.
 
3.       
The previous L1 application included a request
for an order for the payment
of arrears of rent.
The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or
some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request in this L4 application an order for the payment of arrears
of rent and compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenants were ordered
to pay $6,896.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the
Landlord's application fee in
previous consent Order TNL-33148-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $5,554.00 and that
amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order TNL-33148-21
is cancelled.




 
5.       
Since the date of the consent
order, the Tenants
have failed to pay the full rent that
became owing for the period from November 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.
 
6.       
On March 18, 2017 the Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,290.00 from the
Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.       
Interest is owing on the rent
deposit from the date of collection, March 18, 2017, to December 31, 2020. There was no guideline rent increase allowed
(and consequently no interest on deposit) in 2021 due to
COVID19.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
Previous consent order TNL-33148-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move
out of the rental
unit on or before
January 15, 2022 (standard 11 days from the
issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
If the Tenants made any payments
to the Landlord after this L4 application was filed, those
amounts shall be deducted from the calculations below.
 
4.       
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $7,060.13*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 4, 2022 (the issuance
date of this order) and the costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord
owes on the rent deposit.
 
5.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$44.12 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
January 5, 2022 to the date the Tenants
actually move out of
the unit or get evicted.
 
6.       
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
15, 2022, the Tenants will
start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 16, 2022 at .00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 16, 2022.
 
 
January 4, 2022

The tenant has until January 14, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 14, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on July 16, 2022 if the order has not been
filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that
has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
