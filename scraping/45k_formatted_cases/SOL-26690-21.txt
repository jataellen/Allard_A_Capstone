Order under
Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number:
SOL-26690-21




 
In the matter
  of:


 
3416
  LANSDOWN DRIVE BURLINGTON ON L7M1V1


 




Between:


Charanjit Singh


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Karen Cass


Tenant



 
 
 
On December 8, 2021, Charanjit Singh (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Karen Cass (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant entered
into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Landlord and the Tenant signed
an agreement to terminate the tenancy as of
February 28, 2022.
 
2.       
Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date,
it is not appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application
filing fee as costs.
 
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 28, 2022.
 
2.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.




File Number: SOL-26690-21
 
 
 
 
3.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 1, 2022.
 
 
 
4.       
The tenant has until January
21, 2022 to file a motion with the
Board to set aside the order under s. 77(6)
of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January
21, 2022 the order will be
stayed, and the Board will schedule a hearing.
 
 
5.       
In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on September
1, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
