Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-02707-18











 
 

SM and MR (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict AE and EA (the 'Tenants') because they did not
pay the rent that they owe. The Landlords also claimed administration charges
related to NSF cheques.
 
This application was heard in Burlington on June 15,
2018.  The Landlords and the Tenant, AE, attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants did not pay the
total rent they were required to pay for the period from March 1 to June 30,
2018.  The Landlords also incurred charges of $40.00 for administration charges
related to cheques from the Tenants, which were returned NSF.  Consequently,
the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective April 19, 2018.  
2.     
The Tenants did not deny
owing rent arrears, though a cheque was provided shortly before the hearing,
which had yet to clear.  Evidently, they stopped paying rent after being
informed by the Landlords of their intention to sell the rental unit.  
3.     
The Tenants simply requested
that eviction be delayed until July 15, 2018.  I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until July 15, 2018, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of
the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenants void the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before July 15,
2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlords $8,088.55*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to June 28, 2018 and the total charges related to NSF cheques
tendered to the Landlords by or on behalf of the Tenants.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlords $67.40 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting June 29, 2018 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlords $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before July 15, 2018, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from July
16, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before July 15, 2018, then starting July 16, 2018, the Landlords may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlords, on or after July 16, 2018.
8.     
If the Tenants wish to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlords or
to the Board in trust:
i)        $8,415.00 if the payment is made on or before June 30, 2018, or
ii)       $10,465.00 if the payment is made on or before July 15, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after July 16, 2018
but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenants
are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlords.
