Order

Tenancies Act, 2006

I S (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict S S (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant,
another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the
residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the
premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to
compensate the Landlord for the damage; and because the Tenant has been
persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent. 
 
This application was heard in Toronto on
September 4, 2019.
 
The Landlord and the
Tenant attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
On the Persistent Late
Application:
 
1.      The Landlord served the Tenant with an Notice to Terminate a Tenancy
at the End of the Term (N8) alleging that the Tenant has persistently paid her
rent late.  In particular it is alleged that the Tenant paid her rent late on
at least 7 occasions between July 2018 and June 2019.  
2.      The Landlord’s application alleges that the Tenant paid her rent
late because it was not received by him on the first day of the rental period. 
The rental period runs from 21st of each month to the 20th
of each month.  
3.      The Tenant did not dispute paying rent between July 2018 and May
2019 because there was confusion over June 2018 rent which the Tenants bank
cancelled the e-transfer after 30 days because the Landlord failed to accept
it.  The Tenant testified that she paid on time since the application was filed
and the Landlord did not dispute this.  
4.      Based on the testimony of the parties, and considering all of the
disclosed circumstances under s. 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),  I find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from
eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
On the Notice
to Terminate a Tenancy Early (N5) 
5.      The Landlord served an Notice to Terminate a Tenancy Early (N5)
alleging that the Tenant’s autistic cousin who was staying with her pulled the
fire alarm and when the fir department realized it was false alarm they issued
an invoice for a wasted trip.  
6.      The Tenant admits that her autistic cousin pulled the alarm and
therefore she is responsible.  She also testified that she asked that Landlord
for permission to repay the charge gradually.  
7.      The Landlord opposes any payment plan and wishes to terminate the
Tenancy.  
8.      the Tenant was forthright that despite her initial denial, she later
accepted when presented with the evidence that her cousin pulled the alarm. 
For this reason, 
9.      I am satisfied that a person permitted in the residential complex by
the Tenant has engaged in conduct which has substantially interfered with the
landlord’s lawful right or interest. 
10.   The Landlord has incurred costs of $1,441.46 to repair the damage
property that was damaged and cannot be reasonably repaired.
11.   The Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it
was due.
12.   The tenancy is 5 years old.  The problems have just arisen in the
past year. They do not rise to a level of seriousness that would justify
terminating a tenancy. Therefore, having  considered
all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The landlord’s application
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant is denied on the following
condition:
a)    The Tenant shall pay the full monthly rent on or before the first
day of each rental period, commencing November 21, 2019 and for 12 months
thereafter up to October 21, 2020.
2.     
The Tenant shall refund the $1444.46 the
Landlord was charged for the false fire alarm as follows: 
(a)  The
Tenant shall make the following payments to the Landlord in respect of the
monies owing under paragraph 2 of this order:

3.      If the Tenant fails to make any of the payments in accordance with

Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenant, and for the payment of any new arrears of rent and NSF
charges not already ordered under paragraph 1 of this order. The Landlord must
make the application within 30 days of a breach of a condition set out in paragraph
2 of this order. 
(b)      The balance owing under paragraph 2 of this order shall become
payable on the day following the date of default. The monies owing shall bear
interest at the post-judgment interest rate determined under subsection 207(7)
of the Act.
 
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing on or before November 9, 2019, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
November 10, 2019 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
