Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-56937-21
 
 



In the matter of:


LOWER, 1620 FRONT
ROAD LASALLE ON N9J2B6


 




Between:


Peter Csernyu


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Richard Lafontaine


Tenant



 
 
 
Peter Csernyu (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Richard Lafontaine (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for
each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard via video conference on February 17,
2022.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s legal representative, Thomas
Vanner, and the Tenant attended
the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s application is
based on a notice of termination that was served pursuant to section
64 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act'). For the following reasons, I find that the notice of
termination is invalid and the Landlord’s application must be dismissed.
 
2.    
The notice of termination does not
inform the Tenant that he has 7 days to correct his behaviour and void the notice. Subsection 64(2)(c) says that an N5 notice of termination
“shall require the tenant, within seven days, to stop the conduct
or activity or correct the omission set out in the notice.” If a Tenant
corrects their behaviour within those 7 days, subsection 64(3) says the notice
is void and cannot form the basis of an application before the Board.
 
3.    
As the notice of
termination fails to give the Tenant an opportunity to correct their behaviour
and void the notice, it fails to comply with the mandatory requirements of the
Act and is invalid. As the notice
is invalid, the Landlord’s application must be dismissed.
