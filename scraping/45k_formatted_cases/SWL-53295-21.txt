In the matter
of:


115, 82 YORK STREET
  LONDON ON N6A1A7


 




Between:


Richmond Properties (London) Inc.


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Isabelle Ho


Tenant



 
Richmond Properties (London) Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order requiring Isabelle Ho (the 'Tenant') to pay compensation for
the damages caused by the Tenant or a person the Tenant permitted in the
residential complex
This application was heard via
video/teleconference on October
25, 2021.
The Landlord’s Agent Come Sanford and the Tenant
attended the hearing. The Tenant spoke with
Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
Witness: Fred Villauer attended
to give testimony on behalf of the Landlord.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application was originally for
termination of the tenancy for undue damage,
but after the Landlord filed the application the Tenant has moved out of the
rental unit. The application is now for compensation for undue damage pursuant
to section 89 of the Act.
 
2.     The Tenant was still in possession of the rental
unit as of the date the application was filed.
 
3.     Section 89 (1) of the Act provides, that a landlord
may apply to the Board for an order requiring a tenant to pay reasonable costs
that the landlord has incurred or will incur for the repair of or, where repairing is not reasonable, the replacement of damaged property, if the tenant, another occupant
of the rental unit or a person whom the tenant permits in the residential
complex wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to the rental unit or the
residential complex.
 
4.     On any application before the Board,
the party making
an allegation in an application has the onus of proving those allegations on a balance of
probabilities.
 
5.     The standard of proof requires the party to show with
evidence that, “more likely than not”, their assertions are true and that evidence “must be sufficiently clear,
convincing and cogent to satisfy the balance of probabilities test.”




 
6.    
The Landlord alleges that after
the Tenant vacated the rental unit there was an overwhelming smell/odor in the unit. The Tenant was contacted and asked to have a deep clean completed.
 
7.     The Tenant retained
‘Steamers Cleaning Services
to complete a deep cleaning
and deodorization the Unit.
 
8.    
The Landlord asserts that despite that cleaning effort
the odor persisted
to a level that the Landlord was unable to re-rent the unit,
and further alleges that the Tenant caused extensive damage to the unit
flooring resulting from her cat soiling and urinating on the floorboards in
different areas of the rental unit.
 
9.    
The Tenant acknowledged having a cat and that there was a lingering odor within the rental unit after she vacated but disputes the odor/smell was a result
of her cat soiling and
urinating on the floorboards in different areas of the rental unit.
 
10.  The Landlord submitted
a number of photographs of the claimed
damage and submits that they
incurred or will incur costs of $1,546.06 to repair the damage and/or replace
property that was damaged and cannot be reasonably repaired.
•        
$645.00 for floor material
•        
$810.75 for installation/labour
•        
$84.00 for sealant and
trim
•        
$177.86 HST
•        
$1,546.06
 
11.  Based on the totality of the testimonies given and evidence
presented, I was satisfied that the unit was damaged in some way by a
cat soiling and urinating on the floorboards in different areas of the rental
unit.
 
12.  I was satisfied the Tenant caused
undue damage to the
rental unit and that the Landlord
was required to replace certain sections of the flooring in the rental unit and
incurred costs of $1,546.06 to repair the damage and/or replace property that
was damaged.
 
13.  The order contains
all the reasons for the decisions within
the order. No other reasons will be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant terminated June 30, 2021, the date the Tenant moved out of the rental
unit.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,546.06, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage and/or
replacing the damaged property.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.




 
4.    
The Tenant shall pay the total amount owing**
to the Landlord on or before
February 28, 2022.
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before February
28, 2022, he will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
28, 2022, the Landlord has the right anytime after March 1, 2022 to
collect from the Tenant the amount owing or any outstanding balance as a result
of this order.
