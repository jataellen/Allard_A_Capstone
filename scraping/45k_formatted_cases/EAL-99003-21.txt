Joshua Brooks


Tenant



 
 
On November 16, 2021,
Siteline (5-30 Glenn Wood) Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Joshua Brooks (the 'Tenant') and
for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on November 15,
2021 with respect to application EAL-95750-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order. Pursuant to subsection 78(5) of the Act, an application made under section
78 must be filed no later than 30 days after the breach of the order.
 
2.     In the application the Landlord claims
that the Tenants
breached the following condition(s) specified in the
order:
 
The Tenant failed to pay to the
Landlord $800.00 on or before August 17, 2021 and September 14, 2021 towards
arrears of rent. The tenant also
failed to pay to the Landlord $876.70 on or before
October 12, 2021. The Tenant
has also failed
to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from September 1,
2021 to September 30, 2021
 
3.     However, the Landlord
filed this application by email to the Board on November
16, 2021. The application was
filed more than 30 days after the missed payments were due in the order.
Therefore, the Landlord’s claim that the Tenants breached the order is out of
time.
 
4.    
The Board has no jurisdiction to consider this application, which was filed beyond 30 days
after the alleged breaches.
