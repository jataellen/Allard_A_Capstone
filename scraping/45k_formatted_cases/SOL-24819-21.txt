Christopher McKittrick


Tenant



 
 
 
Live Well Property
Management (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Christopher McKittrick (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on January 11, 2022.
Only the Landlord’s Agent,
Matt Christie, attended
the hearing. As of 11:27
a.m., the Tenant
was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The certificate of
service included with the Landlord’s application indicates the N4 notice was
served to the Tenant by mail on August 12, 2021. When serving a notice by mail
the party serving the document is required to include an additional 5 calendar days for transit. Taking this into account the
Tenant would have received the notice on August 17, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s notice lists a termination date of August
30, 2021, which is only thirteen
(13) days following when the document
would have been received through
the mail.
 
3.    
The Landlord’s Agent was not able to provide any proof of service at an earlier
date then August 17, 2021.
With this being the case, the Tenant was not provide adequate time to resolve
the notice.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord's application is dismissed.
