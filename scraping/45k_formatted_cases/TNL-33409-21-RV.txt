Tenants




 
 
Review Order
 
Northwood Terrace LP (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Moe Sebani and Hanaie Alshbat (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was resolved
by order TNL-33409-21 issued on October
20, 2021.
 
On November 1, 2021, the Tenants requested
a review of the order alleging they were not reasonably able to participate in the hearing
because the Notice
of Hearing they received gave them the wrong sign information.
 
On November 17, 2021, the Board issued interim
order TNL-33409-21-RV-IN staying
the order issued on October
20, 2021.
 
The Tenants’ request was heard by
way of video conference on February 1, 2022.
The Landlord’s Legal Representative, Jane Volkova, the Landlord’s Legal
Representative, Elaine Page and the Tenant, Moe Sebani (‘MS’) attended the
hearing. The Tenant spoke to Tenant
Duty Counsel prior to the commencement of the hearing. MS represented the interest of the other named Tenant, Hanaie
Alshbat who is his roommate
and was not present at the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Tenants’ Request to Review
 
1.       
MS testified that he signed into
the video conference room indicated on the Notice of Hearing. The Tenant’s screen told him that he
was waiting on the host
to let him in. At approximately 2:00 pm in the afternoon, MS was still waiting and no hearing.
He called the Board for
assistance. He got through to the
Board later that day and was advised




 
that he was in the wrong video
conference room. MS’ hearing was in a
different room than what was listed n the Notice of Hearing. The Board’s records confirm that the
amended Notice of Hearing containing the correct video
conference line was not sent to
the Tenants.
 
2.       
The Landlord’s Representative consented to the review
request on the basis the Tenants
did not get the amended Notice of Hearing containing the correct video
conference information.
 
3.       
The Tenants’ request to review is granted.
 
New Hearing
of the Landlord’s L1 Application
 
4.       
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from June 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective June 25, 2021.
 
5.       
The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
6.       
The new lawful monthly
rent as of January 1, 2022 is $1,631.58.
 
7.       
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,509.24 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
8.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenants for the period from June 26, 2021
to June 25, 2021.
 
9.       
The Tenants paid $10,595.00 after the application was filed.
 
10.    The Landlord’s Representative submitted that the amount owed to the Landlord is
$2,418.46 which is inclusive of arrears of rent ($2,232.46) and the cost ($186.00) for filing
the application.
 
Tenant’s Evidence
 
11.   
MS disagrees with the amount of
arrears of rent. It is his position that the amount should be lower
because he cancelled his parking spot in June 2020 to July 2021. MS entered in evidence an email dated
April 30, 2021. This is an email from
MS to the Landlord’s Agent indicating the Landlord owed him a credit of
$1,133.00 for his parking fees that were cancelled in June 2020.    MS also
entered in evidence a copy of the parking agreement for June 2020 which he did not sign. It is MS’ position that because he did not sign the agreement, he did not renew
his parking spot.
 
12.    MS testified that he does not want to move out the
rental unit. He has lived there since
2018. He has the money to pay the monthly
rent. If evicted,
he would have not place
to go.
 
Landlord’s Evidence




 
13.   
The Landlord’s Agent testified
that MS never cancelled his parking spot. She further maintained that MS
continued to use the parking space. In
support of her position she entered in evidence an email to her from MS. The email is dated April 21, 2021. In the email MS expresses his displeasure
that his parking spot was blocked by the car of one of the Landlord’s employees. The Landlord’s Agent further testified
that she told MS that if
he wanted to cancel his parking spot,
he needed to do so by
providing written notice
to the Landlord. MS did not do
this.
 
Findings
 
14.   
On a balance of probabilities, I
am satisfied that the Tenants did not cancel their parking spot with the Landlord. The most compelling evidence before me is the email
from MS to the Landlord
on April 21, 2021 where he
complained that his parking spot was blocked
by a vehicle belonging to one of the Landlord’s employee. It stands to reason, that if MS truly believed
that he cancelled his parking with the Landlord,
he would have no reason to
file a complaint that the parking spot was blocked. I also considered the fact MS never provided written notice to
the Landlord that he wanted to cancel his parking spot. The action of simply
not signing the yearly renewal is not proper
notice to the Landlord. Given my finding, I further find that the
arrears of rent owed to the Landlord are as calculated in paragraph 10 above.
 
Relief from Eviction
 
15.   
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until March 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. In
making this finding, I considered the fact that the Tenants have made
significant payments to the Landlord since the application was filed. I believe this speaks to the Tenants
commitment to preserving the tenancy. Further,
given the current state of the COVID-19 pandemic, if the Tenants are unable to
repay the arrears of rent, they may require additional time to secure new
housing.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The Tenant’s request for review is granted.
 
2.       
Order TNL-33409-21 issued on October 18, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the
