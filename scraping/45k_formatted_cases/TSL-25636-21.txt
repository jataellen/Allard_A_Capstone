File Number: TSL-25636-21
 



In the matter
of:


401, 5 HILL
HEIGHTS RD TORONTO ON
  M8Y1Y9


 




Between:


Patrick Shallow


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Anna Ewa Szarek


Tenant



 
On November 11,
2021, Patrick Shallow (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Anna Ewa Szarek (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on September 8, 2021 with respect to application TSL- 07225-19.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenant was to ensure
that the rental
unit is decluttered on or before
October 31, 2021 and that the condition of the rental unit meets a Level
2 of the Clutter Image Rating Scale.
 
Upon inspection on November 5, 2021, the Tenant
had failed to declutter the unit
and failed to maintain a Level 2 of the Clutter Image Rating Scale.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TSL-07225-19 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 17, 2022.
 
3.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January
18, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
4.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 18, 2022.
