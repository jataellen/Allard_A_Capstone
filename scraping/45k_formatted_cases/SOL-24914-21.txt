and


 




 


Brian Robertson
  Laura Robinson


Tenants



 
 
 
Vanmeer Farms Inc (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Brian Robertson and Laura Robinson (the
'Tenants')
 
This application was heard via video conference on January 5, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s Representative
Wilhelmina Vermeersch, the Landlord’s Legal Representative Genevieve Good, the Tenants
and the Tenants’
Legal Representative Ian Aitken
attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.     
For the reasons that follow, I
find that the Landlord, on behalf of the purchasers, in good faith requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants will be
terminated.
 
2.     
The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit which is a rural property. This is a month-
to-month tenancy, with rent of $730.00 due on the first of the month.
 
3.     
Along with the Landlord’s L2 application, an N12 notice
of termination, certificates of service, declarations and Schedule B were completed and
attached.
 
4.      On July 20, 2021, the Landlord entered
into an agreement of purchase
of sale of the rental unit with the purchasers intending
to move into the rental unit. The
closing date as stipulated on the Agreement of Purchase and Sale was November
1, 2021.
 
5.     
On July 28, 2021 the Landlord
served an N12 notice of termination on the Tenants.
The N12 notice states that the Landlord, on behalf of the purchasers, intend to move into the




 
rental unit and occupy it for at least one year. The N12 notice sought possession of the
rental unit for September 30, 2021.
 
6.     
The Landlord testified that the closing
date of the purchase of the property
was extended to March 1, 2022
due to the Landlord not being able to deliver vacant possession of the rental
unit.
 
7.     
A preliminary issue was raised at
the outset of the hearing wherein the Tenants alleged that the address on the
N12 notice of termination is incorrect and is therefore invalid. The Landlord states that there should not
be a strict reading of the address as it is a rural address and are at times
inconsistent with short forms being utilized and names being reversed. The Landlord also states that the Tenants
themselves have used the address
as set out on the N12 notice of termination.
 
8.     
There was no dispute that the
Tenants received mail correspondence and cheques by courier at the address as
stipulated on the N12 notice of termination.
Documentation provided to the Board relating
to this matter reference various
forms of an address for the
rural rental property.
 
9.     
Based on the evidence before the
Board, it appears that this rural property may indeed have different but correct addresses. I am satisfied
that the address
as stipulated on the
N12 notice of termination holds no confusion
as to the address of the property
and is not prejudicial to the Tenants.
 
10.   Section 48.1 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the ‘Act’) requires the Landlord to provide compensation to the Tenants
in an amount equal to one month’s rent where an N12 notice is served. The Landlord testified that they provided
the Tenants with a compensation cheque on September 22, 2021 prior
to the termination date specified
in the N12 notice of
termination and that it was cashed on October 1 2021.
 
11.   Pursuant to section 72(1) of the Act, the
Landlord provided two signed declarations from the purchasers dated September
28, 2021 and another set dated
October 12, 2021 stating that they require
the rental unit for
their own personal residential use for a period of at least one year.
 
12.   The issue to be determined by the Board
is whether the Landlord has satisfied the “good
faith” requirement set out in subsection 48(1) of the Act which
provides:
 
A landlord may, by notice,
terminate a tenancy if the landlord in good faith requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation for a period
of at least one year by,
 
(a)  
the landlord;
….
 
13.   The onus is on the Landlord to establish that the Landlord
in good faith requires the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation.




 
14.  
In Salter v. Beljinac, 2001 CanLii 40231 (ON SCDC),
the Divisional Court determined that a
Landlord satisfied the “good faith” requirement to terminate a tenancy where the person identified in the notice of
termination genuinely intends to occupy the rental unit for residential
purposes.
 
15.   The Tenants did not provide
any evidence challenging the Landlord’s evidence
respecting the purchasers’ requirement to use the rental unit for
residential purposes.
 
16.   I find that, based on the evidence
and submissions and on a balance
of probabilities, that the purchasers genuinely intend to
use the rental unit for their residence and that the purchasers in good faith,
require possession of the rental unit for their residence.
 
17.   Pursuant to section 83 of the Act, I am
required to consider all of the circumstances in the case including both parties’ situations to determine if it would be appropriate to grant relief.
 
18.  
The Tenants testified that they have resided at the
rental until since October, 2010. Their
source of income is a disability pension, income from part-time employment and a settlement from a personal injury
claim. The Tenants state that they
have attempted to secure alternative housing but have not been successful to
date. They testified that they
purchased a trailer in the fall of 2021
but have nowhere to put the trailer
for them to reside
in. The Tenants are hoping to stay in
the rental unit until at least the end of April, 2022.
 
19.   The Landlord’s position is that the Tenants received
notice to vacate in July, 2021 and have had six months to find alternative housing. They submit
that the Tenants
have had plenty of time and
have not taken sufficient steps to locate somewhere else to live. The Purchasers have had to extend their
closing date for the sale of the rental unit and are themselves residing in a
trailer. The Landlords seek an
immediate eviction.
 
20.   I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act (the “Act”)
and find that it would not be unfair to postpone
the eviction until March 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. Postponing
the Tenants’ eviction until March
31, 2022 will provide the Tenants with more time to secure another
rental unit given their financial and medical status or secure a location
for their trailer.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated, as of
September 30 2021. The Tenants must move out of the rental
unit on or before March 31, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated on or before March 31, 2022, then starting
April 1, 2022 the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.




 
3.    
Upon receipt of this order, the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after April 1, 2022. The Sheriff is requested to expedite the enforcement
of this order.

Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
