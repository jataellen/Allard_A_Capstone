Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-34465-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


34 ROLLINGHILL ROAD RICHMOND HILL ON L4E4C6


 




Between:


Kun Yang


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Bai Xie


Tenant



 
 
 
Kun Yang (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Bai Xie (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has been
persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 956 0593 7653# on January
20, 2022. The Landlord,
represented by Julie Jing Shu, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has persistently failed
to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
2.     The Tenant has not paid rent on time since moving into
the rental unit on April 1, 2019. The Tenant has not paid rent on time since the Landlord
served the notice on the Tenant
in August 2021.
 
3.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from March 25, 2019 to October 31, 2021.
 
4.     The Landlord is seeking termination of the tenancy
and the Tenant was not present to request relief from eviction.
 
5.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of February
4, 2022. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 4, 2022.

2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$82.19 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from January 25, 2022 to the date
the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
February 4, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 5, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 4, 2022, then starting
February 5, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 5, 2022.
