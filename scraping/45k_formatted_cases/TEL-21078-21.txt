Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-21078-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


6, 2029 VICTORIA PARK AVENUE
  SCARBOROUGH ON M1R1V4


 




Between:


Starlight Canadian Residential Growth Fund


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Danielle Benoit
  Sandra Benoit


Tenants



 
 
 
Starlight Canadian Residential Growth Fund (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Danielle Benoit and Sandra Benoit
(the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because
the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the
Board on July 7, 2021 with respect to application TEL-13017-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants
have not met the following
condition specified in the order: The
Tenants failed to pay $350.00 towards the arrears, on or before November 1,
2021.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $2,927.91 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order TEL-13017-20. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $1,727.91 and that amount
is included in this order. As a result, the previous order TEL-13017-20 is
cancelled.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $2,878.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.

6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from May 2, 2020 to
January 7, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order TEL-13017-20 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 18, 2022.
 
1.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlord $2,393.13*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 7, 2022, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$94.62 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 8, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
3.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before
January 18, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
January 19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
3.     If the unit is not vacated on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January
19, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
4.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 19, 2022.

The tenant has until January 17, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 17, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on July 19, 2022 if
the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
