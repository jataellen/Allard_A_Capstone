In the matter
of:


625 LAKESIDE AVENUE
  MISSISSAUGA ON L5G1N7


 




Between:


Li Fan


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kayla Corbie


Tenant



 
 
 
This amended order is issued to correct a clerical error in
the original order issued January 7, 2022. The
amendment is bolded and underlined for ease of reference.
 
Li Fan (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kayla Corbie (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard by
videoconference on December 21, 2021. The Landlord’s Agent, Anam Siddique and the
Tenant’s Representative, Vida Corbie attended the hearing.
 
The Landlord’s claim for the period ending December 31, 2021 exceeds the Board’s monetary jurisdiction of $35,000.00. The Landlord indicated a desire to proceed
with the hearing of the application and voluntarily waived the portion of the
claim that exceeds the Board’s monetary jurisdiction.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from December
1, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective September 7, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $5,700.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $5,700.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.




 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from October 13, 2020 to September 7, 2021.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the parties and whether
the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 15, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$35,000.00*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 7, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
15, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 16, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January
15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 16, 2022.
 
7.    
If, on or before
January 15, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $79,986.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain
in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.    
The Tenant may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
16, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
