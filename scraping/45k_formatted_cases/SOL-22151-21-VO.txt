of:

Between:

Landlord

Melody
Neilson


Tenant



 
 
 
 
Melody Neilson
(the 'Tenant') filed a motion to set aside order
SOL-22151-21 because, before the
eviction order was enforced, the Tenant paid the amount required under
subsection 74(11) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') to void the order.
 
This motion was heard
by video conference on December 21, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord’s legal
representative, J. Tonnos,
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant filed a motion to set aside order SOL-22151-21, issued on September 14, 2021.
 
2.    
Order SOL-22151-21 was a standard termination order. Set aside motions are reserved for orders that meet the criteria under subsection 78(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).
 
3.    
The Tenant had the option of filing a motion to void order SOL-22151-21 pursuant
to subsection 74(11) of the Act.
 
4.    
The Tenant’s motion met
the criteria of a voiding motion, and she was eligible to file a motion to void
pursuant to this section. Consequently,
I find that the Tenant’s motion, while in the form of a set aside motion under subsection 78(1) of the Act, was, in fact, a
motion to void under section 74(11) of the Act.
 
5.    
The Landlord’s legal representative said that the Tenant paid everything that was owed to
the Landlord, bringing her balance to zero to September 30, 2021.




File Number: SOL-22151-21-VO
 
6.    
The Landlord’s legal representative said that the Tenant now owes rent for November and December, 2021.
 
7.    
Nevertheless, I find on the Landlord’s uncontested evidence, that the Tenant
voided order SOL-22151-21
after it became enforceable.
 
8.    
The Tenant has not previously made a motion
under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside an eviction order during the
period of the Tenant's tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
9.    
The Tenant has paid $2,786.00 to the Board,
and this amount
is the amount required under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to void the eviction order to September 30, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order SOL-22151-21 is void and cannot be enforced by the Landlord.
 
2.    
The amount of $2,786.00 paid into the Board by the Tenant shall be paid out to the Landlord.

an eviction order during the period of the Tenant's tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
