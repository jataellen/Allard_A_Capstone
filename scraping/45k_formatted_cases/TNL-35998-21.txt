Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Christine Rudd
  Stacy Irving


Tenants



 
 
 
Dalton Georgina Properties Inc
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Christine Rudd and Stacy Irving (the 'Tenants') because they or another occupant
of the rental unit have committed an illegal act or have carried out, or permitted someone to carry out an illegal trade, business or occupation
in the rental unit or the residential complex; and because they, another
occupant of the rental unit or a person the Tenants permitted in the
residential complex have seriously impaired the safety of any person. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the
unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard via video conference on February 3, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord’s legal representative, Allistair Trent, attended the hearing.
 
At 1:22 p.m. and 1:47 p.m. the Tenants
were not present
or represented at the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord indicated
that the Tenants
each signed a Form N11 (Agreement to End the Tenancy) with a termination date of
February 28, 2022. The Landlord asked that the Board accept the Form N11 to end
the tenancy and convert the L2 application to an L3 application.
 
2.     At the hearing,
I asked whether
the Landlord had a written
agreement from the Tenants
that they were consenting to the termination of the tenancy with respect to
this L2 application. The Landlord did not have any such written agreement from
the Tenants.
 
3.     I explained to the Landlord
that the Board
could not convert
the L2 application to an L3
application.
 
4.    
Notwithstanding, the Landlord was advised that if the Board can issue an order
terminating the tenancy based on the Form N11, it would.

5.    
If the Board could not issue such an order, the Landlord requested
that the application be withdrawn.
 
6.     The Board cannot issue an order terminating the
tenancy on the L2 application as the Board did not have a hearing on the merits
of the application. Furthermore, the Board did not have a consent from the parties
on this application to end the tenancy.
 
7.     In accordance with subsection 200(4)
of the Act, I consent
to the withdrawal of the application.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
