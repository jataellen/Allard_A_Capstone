Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-18580-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


909, 191
MAIN STREET W HAMILTON ON L8P4S2


 




Between:


Cityhousing Hamilton Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Linda Auchterlonie


Tenant



 
 
Cityhousing Hamilton
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Linda Auchterlonie (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February
1, 2022 at 9:10am.
 
Only the Landlord attended
the hearing. The Landlord
was represented by Katherine MacIntyre.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
August 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
30, 2020.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful monthly rent is $604.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant paid $9,131.00
after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The arrears and costs owing to February 28, 2022 total
$1,812.00.
 
6.     The Landlord seeks a standard, voidable order with an
extension of 60 days. This is because the Landlord
is aware that an external
agency is working
with the Tenant to pay off the arrears.
 
7.     I find the Landlord’s request only benefits the Tenant
as it provides greater than the standard eleven days to pay off the amount in full. The Landlord’s request
is granted.
 
8.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the




File Number: SOL-18580-20
 
Tenant, and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until April 9, 2022 pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
9.     This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
April 9, 2022.
 
2.     As of the date of this order,
the amount of the rent deposit exceeds
the arrears of rent
and compensation the Landlord is entitled to by $2,214.34*.
 
3.     However, the Landlord
is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenant:
 
a)    
$12.21 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
February 9, 2022 to the date
the Tenant moves out of the unit, and
 
b)    
$186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.     The Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
April 9, 2022, then starting April 10, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 10, 2022.
 
7.     If the Tenant
wishes to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust:
i)              
$1,812.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022, or
ii)            
$3,020.00 if the payment
is made on or before April 9,
2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.    
The Tenant may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after
April 10, 2022 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to
make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
