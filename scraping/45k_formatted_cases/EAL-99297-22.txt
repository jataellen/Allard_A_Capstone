In the matter
of:


219, 31 BAYSWATER PLACE KINGSTON ON K7M2B8


 




Between:


Osgoode Properties


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


John Tod


Tenant



 
 
 
Osgoode Properties (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict John Tod
(the 'Tenant') and for an order to
have the Tenant pay compensation for damage the Tenant owes because
the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on August 17, 2021 with respect to
application EAL-94354-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following condition
specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed
to pay to the Landlord
$100.00 on or before February
1, 2022 towards damages.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order EAL-94354-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before March 7, 2022.
 
3.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 7, 2022, then starting
March 8, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
4.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after March 8, 2022.
