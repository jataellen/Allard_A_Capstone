Review Order
 
Gregory Gaglione
and Norma Gaglione
(the 'Landlords') applied
for an order permitting the rent
charged to be increased by more than the guideline for one or more of the
rental units in the residential complex because of municipal taxes and charges.
 
This application was resolved by order TSL-12939-20 issued on October
4, 2021.
 
On October
12, 2021, the Landlords
requested that order TSL-12939-20 issued
on October 4, 2021, be reviewed.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
Pursuant to Rule 7.1 this
application was heard by way of a
written hearing. The request for
review is similarly being dealt with as a written hearing (pursuant to Rule
26.12). None of the Tenants participated in the original
hearing of this application. Pursuant
to s. 7(2) of the Statutory
Powers Procedure Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.22, the Tenants are not entitled to
any further notice of hearing for this proceeding. It is not necessary to
invite further submissions or evidence on the review from the Landlords.
 
2.    
For the reasons that follow the Landlords’ request
for review is granted and order TSL- 12939-20 issued on October 4, 2021 is replaced with the
order that follows.
 
3.    
This application was denied essentially because the Landlords failed to properly
complete the application form. More particularly:
 
•        
At the time the application was filed one of the rental units in the residential
complex was vacant.




 
•        
On Schedule
1, Part D of the application the Landlords
stated that the total rents for the units covered by the
application is $7,352.00 (Column 2).
 
•        
Under Column 3 the
Landlords were asked to give an amount representing the “total rent charged for
all rental units in the complex affected” by the increase in municipal taxes. In
that column the Landlords put the same amount as in Column
C. That was actually a mistake
on the part of the Landlords.
 
•        
Page 7 of the Instructions booklet
for L5 applications sets out detailed instructions as to how to complete Part D
when one or more of the units in the residential complex is vacant or not
subject to the application.
 
•        
Essentially, what the Landlords
should have done is to assign an average value for
the rent for the vacant unit, and added that to the actual rent received to get
an amount for the total rent charged for all units affected by the municipal
tax increase. Although vacant, the sixth unit is nonetheless affected by the
increase.
 
•        
In this instance the
math looks like this: [$7,352.00 (the total rent for the five covered units)
÷ 5] + $7,352.00 = $8,822.40. That is the amount that should have appeared in Column 3 of Part D of the
Schedule to the application.
 
4.    
On October
7, 2020 the Board sent the
Landlords a standard
deficiency letter. With respect to the specific problem with
the application it states:
 
You have identified the same rent charged on Schedule
1, Part D, Column 2 and 3 however,
you have not applied for an increase
above the guideline for all of the units
in the residential complex. Please clarify the rent charged in Columns 2 and
3. The rent identified in Column 3 should reflect the total rent for all of the
units in the residential complex.
 
[Emphasis added.]
 
5.    
The letter then went on
to instruct the Landlords that If they chose to file a written submission or
amendment in response to the noted deficiency, it had to be done by October 22, 2020. It also noted
that the Landlords would be responsible for serving the Tenants with any amendments the
Landlords wished to make to the application.
 
6.    
On October
9, 2020 the Landlords replied
to the deficiency letter explaining that the sixth unit was vacant at the time the application was filed and that
is why the rent charged set out in
Columns 2 and 3 is the same. Their letter then says “The property tax increase
applies to all 6 units but there is to be an order for only units 1 to 5
inclusive”.
 
7.    
The Board
then proceeded with the written
hearing and dismissed the application on the
basis it was “deficient”. In explaining why it was doing so the Board stated:
 
3.      
The Landlord is
required to include rent for vacant units in Column 3 of Schedule 1, Part D, by applying
the average rent for all the rental
units in the




 
residential complex.
This information is used to calculate the Above Guideline Increase.
 
4.      
As the Landlords have failed to amend the rent claimed
in Schedule 1, Part D, Column
3, for the residential complex, the Board is unable to calculate the
appropriate Above Guideline Increase.
 
[Emphasis added.]
 
8.    
With respect
to the request for review,
as a general rule the Board will only exercise
its discretion to grant a review when it is satisfied the order contains
a serious error, a serious error occurred in the proceeding or the requestor
was not reasonably able to participate in the proceeding.
 
9.    
The review is
granted for the following reasons:
 
•        
The deficiency letter was less than clear
in terms of explaining to the Landlords what the problem was. For
example, it failed to inform the Landlords what was meant by “total rents”, and
failed to direct the Landlords to page 7 of the Instructions booklet for more
information.
 
•        
That lack of clarity is
reflected in the Landlords’ common-sense response. The Landlords clearly did
not understand they were being asked to amend the application so that Column
3 reflected the math the Board
wanted the Landlords to do as
explained on page 7 of the Instructions booklet.
 
•        
The Landlords’ response
to the deficiency letter should have made it clear to the Board that the Landlords
did not understand what was being asked of them, but no
further information was provided.
 
•        
It is actually not true
as stated in the order that the Board was unable to calculate
the rent increase. The information the Landlords provided may not have been in
the right place on the form, but it was sufficient to calculate the rent
increase.
 
10.  Given all of the above,
the review is granted. The previous order
is cancelled and replaced with the following:
 
11.  The Landlords justified a rent increase
above the guideline because of an extraordinary
increase in the cost for municipal taxes and charges.
 
12.  The municipal taxes and charges
claimed by the Landlords in the application have been accepted.
 
13.  I have accepted
the Landlords’ correspondence of October 9, 2020 as a request
to amend and granted the request.




 
14.  On October 2, 2020, the Helping Tenants
and Small Businesses Act, 2020 received Royal Assent. As a result, the following provision was added to the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’):
 
Rent freeze period Definition
 
136.1 (1) In this section,
 
“rent freeze
period” means the period that begins on January 1, 2021 and ends
on December 31, 2021.
 
Non-application, certain
rent increases
 
(2)  
This section
does not apply with respect
to,
 
. . .
 
(c) an increase in rent for a rental unit permitted under subsection 126
(10)  
or section
127 for,
 
(i)  an extraordinary increase in the cost for municipal
taxes and charges as described
in paragraph 1 of subsection 126 (1), if the
increase in rent is permitted by an order of the Board that was issued before
the day the Helping Tenants and Small Businesses Act, 2020 receives
Royal Assent,
 
. . .
 
No rent increase during
rent freeze period
 
(3)  
No landlord
shall increase the rent charged
to a tenant during the rent
freeze period, even if notice of the
increase was given before the day the Helping Tenants and Small Businesses Act, 2020
receives Royal Assent.
 
[Emphasis added.]
 
15.  This means that effective October 2, 2020,
the Board cannot issue an order increasing the rent due to an extraordinary
increase in the cost for municipal taxes and charges as described in paragraph
1 of subsection 126(1) where the increase would take effect during the period
January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2021. Therefore, that portion of the
Landlords’ application seeking a rent increase that would take effect during
the period January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021, must be dismissed. An order
can be issued for the remaining portion
of the application as the rent increase
will not take effect during the
period January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2021.
 
16.  This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlords’ request for review
is granted. Order TSL-12939-20 issued on October
4, 2021 is cancelled and replaced with the following:
 
2.    
The Landlords
may increase the rents charged
by 0.44% for the units set out in Schedule 1.
 
3.    
The Landlords
may increase the rents charged
within the time period of April 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020.
 
4.    
The portion
of the Landlords’ application seeking
an above-guideline rent increase due to
an extraordinary increase in municipal taxes and charges to take effect during
the period January 1, 2021 to March 31, 2021, is dismissed.
 
5.    
The percentage increase set out in paragraph 2 may be taken in addition
to the annual guideline in effect on the increase date for the unit.
 
6.    
The Landlords
or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order within 60 days.
