Louie Cerqua and Daniel

to terminate the tenancy.
 
Determinations:

terminate the tenancy as of January 1, 2022 and the Tenant did not move out of the rental
unit by the termination date
set out in the agreement.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 4, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount
owing on or before February
4, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 5, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
4.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 4, 2022, then starting February
5, 2022, the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
5.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after February 5, 2022.
