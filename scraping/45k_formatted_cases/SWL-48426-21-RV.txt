Anh Tran Thien Nguyen


Tenants



 
 
Review Order
 
Nos Investments Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Thien Nguyen and Anh Tran (the 'Tenants')
because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was resolved by order SWL-48426-21 issued on July 15, 2021. On August 30, 2021, the Tenants
requested a review of the order.
The request
was heard by videoconference on December 7, 2021.
 
The Tenants’
paralegal, M. Bradley,
attended the hearing.
The Landlord sent a representative, R. Chemn, who is not qualified to appear before the Board. Consequently, I did not permit her to
participate in the proceedings.
.
Determinations:
 
1.    The Board
did not have jurisdiction to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants
because the notice of termination (Form N4) is defective. The notice does not provide
the Tenants with at least 14 days’ notice.




File Number: SWL-48426-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    Order SWL-48426-21 issued on July 15, 2021 is cancelled and the application filed by the Landlord is dismissed.
