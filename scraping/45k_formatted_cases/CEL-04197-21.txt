On November
17, 2021, Tj Singh (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Alycia Ginerich and Jordan Arseneau (the 'Tenants') and for an order
to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because
the Tenants failed to meet a condition

15, 2021 with respect to application CEL-02087-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenants have not met the following conditions specified in the order:
 
Effective November 4, 2021, and for (12) twelve consecutive months thereafter, the Tenants will be permitted to smoke
medicinal cannabis in the outdoor designated smoking area which is located
under her patio umbrella set.
 
On November 9, 2021 at 6:12 pm, and on November 10, 2021 at 3:05 pm and 6:07 pm the Landlord received messages
that the Tenants are smoking in the rental unit.
 
Effective
November 4, 2021,
and for (12) twelve consecutive months thereafter, the Tenants will be entitled
to personal use of 35% of the total surface
area of the back yard at the
complex.
 
As of November
15, 2021, the Tenants continues
to use portions of the property that have not been assigned
for there use. To make it clear for
all tenants, the Landlord marked off the area for the Tenants by using string
until the spring of 2022 when the Landlord can install a permanent privacy
structure.
