IMH Pool XX LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Laurie Proulx and Gerard Goyer (the

with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
It is determined that:

for the period from April 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021. Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 28, 2021.
 
2.    
At the hearing, the Landlord’s Legal Representative presented an arrears repayment
plan that was agreed to by both the Tenants and the Landlord. The
Landlord’s Legal Representative submitted a copy of this agreement to the Board
and this agreement will be implemented as part of this order.
 
3.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
4.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,507.00.
 
5.     The Landlord incurred
costs of $186.00
for filing the application and is entitled

of rent arrears, and costs, is
$2,670.00.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall
pay the Landlords
$2,670.00, which represents the arrears of rent and costs outstanding for the period
ending February 28, 2022.

The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $907.00 on or before
February 11, 2022.

August 2022 in full and by the first day of each corresponding month.

in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates required then:

The Landlord may apply
under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”) for an order terminating
the tenancy and evicting the Tenants and for the payment of any new arrears of
rent and NSF charges not already ordered under paragraph 1 of this order. The
