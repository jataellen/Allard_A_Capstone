Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-25413-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


315, 1001
MAIN STREET W HAMILTON ON L8S1A9


 




Between:


Wilstar Management Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Abdulkeny Kerim
  Eroziya Nurayine


Tenants



 
 
 
Wilstar Management Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Abdulkeny Kerim and Eroziya Nurayine (the 'Tenants') because they, another
occupant of the rental unit or a
person the Tenants permitted in the
residential complex have seriously
impaired the safety of any person. The Landlord also claimed compensation for
each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on January 19, 2022.
 
Only the employee of the Landlord, Alex Stevanovic (AS),
and the Landlord’s Representative, David Ciobotaru attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
AS testified that on July 28,
2021, at or around 3pm, smoke was detected emanating from the Tenants’ rental
unit. The Tenants
were not home. Upon entry of the rental unit, AS
discovered a pot had been left unattended on the stove. The stove was set at a high
heat. The pot was removed upon discovery.
 
2.    
AS also testified the smoke detector did not ring. AS investigated and
discovered the batteries had been installed backwards, thus rendering the
smoke detector inoperable. The units in the residential complex are subject
to a yearly fire inspection where smoke
detectors are examined, batteries are changed and/or smoke detectors are
replaced if expired. According to AS, the smoke detector in the rental unit had
passed the most recent inspection.
 
3.     Based on the evidence presented, we find that the
Tenants’ carelessness could have caused a fire. Having left the unit while a pot was on the stove on high heat and
having tampered with the smoke detector, the Tenants’ actions had the
potential to seriously impair the safety of other tenants in the residential
complex




File Number: SOL-25413-21
 
Section
83
 
4.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
5.     AS testified the Tenants were remorseful. This was an
isolated event. The Landlord seeks a conditional order to allow
the Tenants an opportunity to preserve their tenancy.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants, occupant
of the rental unit or invited guest shall not tamper with,
or render inoperable, any
smoke detector(s) in the rental unit.
 
2.     The Tenants, occupant
of the rental unit or invited guest shall not leave the stove
unattended while in use.
 
3.     If the Tenants
fail to comply with paragraphs 1 or 2 of
this order, the Landlord may apply
under section 78 of the Act, without notice to the Tenants, for an order
terminating the tenancy and evicting
the Tenants. The Landlord must make this application no later than 30 days after the Tenants’ breach of
paragraph 1 or 2.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February 28, 2022, they will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from March 1,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
