Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-21272-19
 










 
 

NT
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict DGB
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes;
and because he has been persistently late in paying his rent.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on January 24, 2020.
 
The Landlord`s agent, SG, the Landlord’s representative, NM, and
the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from August 1, 2019 to January 31, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective November 30, 2019.
 
2.      At
the hearing, the Tenant agreed with the Landlord’s evidence of the Tenant’s
rent arrears for the period ending January 31, 2020.
 
3.      The
Tenant also agreed with the Landlord’s evidence that he has been persistently
late in paying the rent.
 
4.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,572.54 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 1,
2018 to November 30, 2019.
 
6.      The
Tenant paid $3,140.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction for non-payment of
rent until February 19, 2020, pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.  
 
8.      At
the hearing, the Tenant testified that he anticipates receiving $10,000.00 from
a family member on or about February 15, 2020.  Under the circumstances, I find
it is not unfair to postpone the voiding date for the application for rent
arrears to February 19, 2020.
 
9.      If
the Tenant voids the part of this eviction order relating to non-payment of
rent, the tenancy shall end on March 31, 2020.
 
10.   Even
if the Tenant voids the part of this eviction order relating to non-payment of
rent, I find that it is appropriate to terminate the tenancy as of March 31,
2020.  The Tenant does not have a regular source of income that will permit the
Tenant to remain in possession of the rental unit.  The Tenant conceded at the
hearing that he cannot afford the monthly rent.  
 
11.   The
Tenant did not adduce reliable evidence that his financial circumstances are
likely to change.  The Tenant testified that he has been unable to earn regular
employment income because of chronic back pain the Tenant has had for 26
years.  
 
12.   I
therefore find that it is appropriate to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant.
 
13.   The
Landlord, however, is holding a rent deposit.  I therefore find that it is not
unfair to postpone the eviction date for the Tenant’s persistent late payment
of rent to March 31, 2020.
It
is ordered that:
The
Application for Non-payment of Rent.
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids this part of the eviction order for non-payment of rent as set
out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The
Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before February 19, 2020.
 
2.      As
of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation
the Landlord is entitled to by $117.38*.
 
3.      However,
the Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the
Landlord owes the Tenant:  $51.70 per day for compensation for the use of the
unit starting January 29, 2020 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit;
and $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.      The
Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as
a result of this order.
 
5.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 19, 2020, then starting February
20, 2020, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 20, 2020.
 
7.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this part of the eviction order for non-payment of
rent and continue the tenancy to March 31, 2020, the Tenant must pay to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $4,920.36 if the payment is made on or before January 31, 2020, or
ii)       $6,492.90 if the payment is made on or before February 19, 2020**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this part of the eviction order for non-payment of rent if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 20, 2020 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.  
The
Application for Persistent Late Payment of Rent
9.      If
the Tenant voids the part of this eviction order for non-payment of rent,
above, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated as of
March 31, 2020.  The Tenant must vacate the rental unit on or before March 31,
2020.
 
10.   If
the unit is not vacated on or before March 31, 2020, then starting April 1,
2020, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
11.   Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 1, 2020.
