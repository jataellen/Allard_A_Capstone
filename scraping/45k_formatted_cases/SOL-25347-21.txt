File Number: SOL-25347-21




 
In the matter
  of:


 
12, 450 RYMAL
ROAD E HAMILTON ON L8W1B3


 




Between:


Victoria Park
Community Homes


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kelly Fudge (Brady)


Tenant



 
 
 
Victoria Park Community Homes (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Kelly Fudge (Brady) (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination
date.
 
This application
was heard via videoconference on January 19, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Representative, Sara Lange, attended
the hearing. Determinations:
1.     
The Landlord served the Notice of
Termination for Persistent Late Payments (N8) on October 14, 2021 via Canada
Post by regular mail. The Landlord then applied for an application to terminate the tenancy (L2) on October
15, 2021 which was one day after the N8 Notice was mailed.
 
2.     
Pursuant to section 191(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), a notice is “deemed validly given if it is
proven that its contents actually came to the attention of the person
from whom it was intended
within the required
time period”. Section 191(3)
of the Act also states a notice given by a mail shall be deemed to have been
given on the fifth day after mailing.
 
3.     
Section 69 of the Residential Tenancies Act states:
 
A landlord
may apply to the Board for an order terminating a tenancy and evicting the tenant if the
landlord has given notice to terminate the tenancy under this Act…
 
4.     
Since the Landlord filed the application four days before
the N8 Notice would have been deemed served, the application
is statute barred.
