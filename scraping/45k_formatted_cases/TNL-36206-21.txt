Julian Morley


Tenant



 
On November 15, 2021, Capreit
Limited Partnership (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Julian Morley (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the
Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order
issued by the Board on August 23, 2021 with respect to application
TNL-32189-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant
if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed to pay to
the Landlord $900.00
on or before October 24, 2021
towards arrears of rent.
 
3.       
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$4,237.87 for rent arrears and NSF cheque charges and the costs related to the
Landlord's application fee in Order TNL-32189-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $2,437.87 and that amount
is included in this order. As
a result, the previous order TNL-32189-21 is cancelled.
 
5.       
Since the date of the order, the Tenant has also failed to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from
November 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.
 
6.       
Since the date of the order, the
Landlord incurred charges of $10.00 for cheques tendered by or on behalf of the Tenant which were returned NSF and $40.00
for related administration
charges.

It is ordered
that:
 
1.       
Order TNL-32189-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 18, 2022.
 
3.       
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $3,807.87*. This amount represents the rent owing up to
November 30, 2021 and the total charges related to NSF cheques tendered to the
Landlord by or on behalf
of the Tenant and the costs related
to the application fee for the
previous application.
 
4.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$43.40 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting December 1, 2021 to
the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
18, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January
19, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after January 19, 2022.

The tenant has until January 17, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
