N.K.
and G.P. o/a W.P.C. (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict K.R. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes.
 
At
the hearing the Tenant applied pursuant to section 82 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') for an order determining that the Landlords
failed to meet the Landlords’ maintenance obligations or failed to comply with
health, safety, housing or maintenance standards.
 
This
application was heard in Whitby on January 5, 2018.
 
The Landlords’ representative, C.A., and the Tenant attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
THE
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.     The
Tenant has not paid the total rent she was required to pay for the period from
October 1, 2017 to November 30, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlords served
a Notice of Termination effective October 5, 2017.
2.     The
Landlords collected a rent deposit of $695.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
3.     Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 1, 2011 to
October 5, 2017.
4.     The
Tenant paid $1,462.00 after the application was filed.
5.     The
Landlords incurred costs of $190.00 for filing the application and entitled to
reimbursement of those costs. 
THE
TENANT’S SECTION 82 CLAIM
6.     The
Tenant states that her stove had not been working since July 1, 2017.  She told
the Landlord’s superintendent, Michelle, at the time it stopped.  The Tenant
says the elements stopped working but the oven worked.
7.     The
Tenant says she told the superintendent again on September 22, 2017 in person. 
The Tenant then states the oven works but only one element at a time.  The
impact of the stove not working properly prevented the Tenant from boiling or
frying her food.  She was only able to use her microwave.  
8.     The
Tenant says that on December 6, 2017, the Landlords had a new stove installed.
9.     The
Landlords submitted an affidavit regarding the situation; however, did not
attend the hearing to answer any relevant questions regarding the affidavit.
10.  Aside
from the absence of the Landlords, on any application before the Board the
person making an allegation bears the burden of proof. This means the Tenant
must lead sufficient evidence to establish that it is more likely than not that
she notified the Landlords of the issues with her stove and the Landlords took
no action.  Here, the Tenant failed to produce any evidence that supports her
claim that she repeatedly told the Landlord of the issue or what the actual
issue was with the stove.  The Tenant also did not submit any receipts
regarding the type of food she had to purchase during this time as she claims
she could only make food in her microwave.  
11.  There may
have been an issue with the stove; however, I am satisfied the Landlords
attended the issue when they were aware of its existence.  The original hearing
was on November 14, 2017, where the Tenant’s section 82 issue of the stove was
brought up before the Board.  The Landlords had a new stove installed within 3
weeks. During this time, the Tenant still had use of the stove in some manner. 

12.  The
Tenant states she is able to pay the amount owed to the Landlords within the
standard 11 day period.  For this reason, the order with standard terms will be
ordered.
13.  I have
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1)
of the Act.
14.  This
order contains all of the reasons for my decision within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.  
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before February 16, 2018.
2.     The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $835.18*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 5, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
3.     The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $24.03 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 6, 2018 to the date she moves out of the
unit.
4.     The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before
February 16, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from February 17, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.     If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 16, 2018, then starting February
17, 2018, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 17,
2018.
8.     If,
on or before February 16, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $2,382.40** to
the Landlords or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. 
This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain
in the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction
may be enforced.
9.     The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 17, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlords. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
