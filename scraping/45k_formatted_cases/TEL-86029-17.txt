D.Y.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Y.M.
(the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for
the purpose of residential occupation and the Tenant did not pay the rent that
the Tenant owes. 
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on January 15, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
THE APPLICATION
FOR LANDLORD’S OWN USE
1.      As
I explained at the hearing the Landlord’s application for an order terminating
the tenancy and evicting the Tenant for landlord’s own use must be dismissed as
it is based on an invalid notice of termination. 
2.      Pursuant
to subsection 48(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’)
the date for termination on an N12 notice like this one must be the last day of
the period of the tenancy or the last day of a fixed term. Here the period of
the tenancy is monthly and the rent is due on the first day of each month.  
3.      So
what s. 48(2) means is that the date of termination on a notice like this must
be the last day of a month. 
4.      The
date of termination on the Landlord’s notice is January 2, 2018. As a result,
it does not meet the mandatory requirements of the Act and this part of the
application must be dismissed. 


THE
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
5.      There
is no dispute between the parties that the Tenant has not paid the total rent
the Tenant was required to pay for the period from November 1, 2017 to January
31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective November 16, 2017.
6.      The
Tenant says she thinks she may have paid rent in November of 2017 but cannot
provide documentation or evidence in corroboration of that statement. Given her
vagueness around this alleged payment I accept the Landlord’s evidence over
that of the Tenant and find that the rent arrears owing for the period ending
January 31, 2018 total $2,895.00. 
7.      The
Landlord incurred costs of $190.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
8.      The
Landlord incurred charges of $180.00 for administration charges related to
cheques tendered by or on behalf of the Tenant, which were returned NSF.
9.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $950.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
10.   Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 30, 2016
to November 16, 2017 totalling $22.08.
11.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. I say this for the
following reasons.
12.   The
Tenant wants to stay in the rental unit. She says she can repay the rent
arrears over time by borrowing the money from her boyfriend. He did not attend
the hearing to testify nor did the Tenant produce any corroborating
documentation to support this assertion. 
13.   The
Tenant has lived in the rental unit since May of 2016. She lives there alone.
The Tenant says she left work about eight months ago and was in receipt of
Employment Insurance sick benefits which ran out after 15 weeks. She then
applied for and started to receive Ontario Works. She intends to apply for
disability benefits but has not yet done so. She says she has an anxiety
disorder and suffers from PTSD. Her monthly income from Ontario Works is about
$733.00. The monthly rent is $965.00. 
14.   The
Tenant testified in great depth at the hearing about flooding in the rental
unit that resulted in disrepair. In response to my questions she stated that
she did not wish to raise a claim under s. 82 of the Act; rather she was
talking about the flooding and disrepair in the context of relief from
eviction. 
15.   Her
primary complaint is that the flooding resulted in mould growth and the
Landlord initially promised that when the tenant upstairs moved out, the Tenant
would be re-housed temporarily in that unit so repairs could be completed. But
when the tenant upstairs moved out, the Landlord moved in. 
16.   The
Tenant takes the position that no mould remediation work should be done while
she is in the unit because it will be a health hazard for her. She says she
showed the Landlord her puffers to explain why and has refused to let the
Landlord proceed with work. She says the Landlord laughed at her. The Tenant
did not produce any medical documentation or evidence from a contractor in
support of the proposition that there is mould or that remedial work will be a
health hazard. 
17.   The
Landlord says she moved into the unit above because she is planning on selling
the home where she was living. She also says once she regains possession of the
Tenant’s basement unit she has no intention of re-renting it. 
18.   She
also states she has tried to do repairs to the basement unit but the Tenant
refuses to co-operate. 
19.   The
Landlord says the Tenant’s non-payment is causing her financial hardship. The
utilities are in the Tenant’s name and she is in arrears of those as well. 
20.   The
Landlord produced text messages at the hearing that corroborate most of her
evidence. 
21.   Given
all of the above, I find that it would be unfair to grant the Tenant relief
from eviction. Her income is insufficient to afford the rental unit let alone
pay off the rent arrears or pay for utilities as well. Given her financial
situation it would be unfair to the Landlord to permit the tenancy to continue.

22.   As
for the state of the rental unit, there is nothing in the evidence that would
suggest the disrepair to the rental unit or the Landlord’s behaviour with
respect to the disrepair constitutes a serious breach of the Landlord’s
obligations under s. 83(3) of the Act. The evidence is simply insufficient to
meet that test.
23.   Given
all of the above, the Board’s standard voidable eviction order shall issue. 
24.   This
order contains all the reasons for the decision within it. No further reasons
shall be issued. 
It
is ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before March 3, 2018.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,761.62 (less any payment made to the
Landlord after the hearing on January 15, 2018)*, which represents the amount
of rent owing and compensation up to February 20, 2018 and the total charges
related to NSF cheques tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant,
less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $31.73 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 21, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March
3, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from March 4, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before March 3, 2018, then starting March 4,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 4, 2018.
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $4,230.00 (less any payment made to the Landlord after the hearing on
January 15, 2018) if the payment is made on or before February 28, 2018, or
ii)       $5,195.00 (less any payment made to the Landlord after the hearing on
January 15, 2018) if the payment is made on or before March 3, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after March 4, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period
of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
