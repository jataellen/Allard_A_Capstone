Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-22675-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


UNIT 8, 632 BARTON STREET
E HAMILTON ON L8L2Z9


 




Between:


Salvatore Caruso


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Lisa Warner
The Estate of Sherman Warner


Tenants



 
 
Salvatore Caruso (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Lisa Warner and The Estate of Sherman Warner (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 14, 2021. Only the Landlord
attended the hearing. As of 9:48 a.m., the Tenants were not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
The application is amended to reflect the change in the
name of the second Tenant.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from May 1,
2021 to December 31, 2021. Because of
the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective June 26,
2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful weekly rent is $300.00.
 
4.    
The Tenants
paid $540.00 after
the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord’s attempts at negotiating a repayment agreement were unsuccessful.
 
6.     The Landlord informed
the Tenant about the hearing.
 
7.    
The Landlord
is not holding a last month's rent deposit.
 
8.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including
the impact of COVID-19 on the




File Number: SOL-22675-21
 
parties and whether the
Landlord attempted to negotiate a
repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act. The
amount outstanding is substantial, and the Tenants have not paid any rent since
the application was filed.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental
unit on or before January 15, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $8,690.96*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 4, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $42.74
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 5, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 15, 2022, the
Tenants will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January 16, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord, on or after January 16, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$9,576.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 8, 2022, or
ii)             
$9,876.00 if the payment
is made on or before January 15, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this
paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or
after January 16, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to
the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
