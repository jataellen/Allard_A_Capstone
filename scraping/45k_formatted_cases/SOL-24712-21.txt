Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24712-21



In the matter
of:


709, 24 IDA
STREET
ST. CATHARINES ON L2R3X5


 




Between:


Starlight Canadian Residential Growth Fund


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Keith Bolohan


 
Tenant



 
 
Starlight Canadian Residential Growth Fund (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Keith Bolohan (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard
by video conference on December
14, 2021.
 
The Landlord's Legal Representative, Sara Matthew, and the Tenant
attended the hearing
however when the application was called for the hearing,
the Tenant was no longer in the video conference and there was no indication as
to why he had left. The Tenant spoke with Tenant Duty Counsel prior to the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective August 29,
2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,454.00.
4.     The Tenant paid $2,500.00 after
the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,454.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with section 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties
and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the
Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before January 16, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $2,073.48*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 5, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay
to the Landlord $47.80 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 6, 2022 to the date the
Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 16, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January 17, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
January 17, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 16, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $4,885.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or
after January 17, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
