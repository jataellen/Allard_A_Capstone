In the matter
of:


1911, 105
HARRISON GARDEN BOULEVARD TORONTO ON M2N0C3


 




Between:


K&G Oakburn Apartments I Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Mohammad Moradi


Tenant



 
 
 
K&G Oakburn
Apartments I Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Mohammad Moradi (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on October 18, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Kenia Afolabi attended
the hearing. As of 2:05 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period
from October 1, 2020 to October 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective February 26, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $2,300.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $2,175.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period from January 1, 2021 to February 26, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $4,600.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.    
I have
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the




 
Tenant and, find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from
eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(a)
and 204(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
1.    
The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $8,686.00, which represents the arrears of
rent and costs $186.00 outstanding for the period ending October 31, 2021.
2.    
The Landlord’s application for eviction
of the Tenant is denied
on the condition that:
 
(a)   The Tenant shall make the following payments to the Landlord in respect of the
monies owing under paragraph 1 of this order:

to and including February 1, 2022 in full, on or before the first day of
each corresponding month.
3.    
If the Tenant fails to make any of the payments
in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates required, then:
(a)   The Landlord may apply under section
78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for
an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, and for the payment
of any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not already ordered under paragraph
1 of this order. The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a
breach of a condition set out in paragraph 2 of this order.
(b)   The balance owing under paragraph 1 of this order shall become payable
on the day following the date of default. The monies owing shall bear interest at the post- judgment interest rate determined
under subsection 207(7) of the Act.
