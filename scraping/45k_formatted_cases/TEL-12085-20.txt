  of:


 
BSMT APT, 61 GLENSTROKE DRIVE
SE SCARBOROUGH ON M1S3A1


 




Between:


Danny Peng


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Ubah Aganeh


Tenant



 
 
Danny Peng (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to determine whether
the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act') applies.
 
This application was heard in VC 120 on October 5, 2021.
 
The Landlord attended the hearing.
Ubah Aganeh (the 'Tenant') did not attend,
though properly served and
despite having a T2 application scheduled to be heard on the same docket.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
D.P. is the owner of a property at 61
Glenstroke Drive in Scarborough, which he
rents out using the Airbnb platform.
Airbnb is a short-term rental company facilitating rental reservations online,
for which they receive a payment from property owners
registered on the site.
 
2.       
On March 14, 2020 U.A. booked the unit for the period of March 14 – 31, 2020 and paid
by credit card through the Airbnb platform. U.A. checked in to the unit that
evening.
 
3.       
On March 31, 2020 U.A. requested
an extension to the booking. D.P advised her to complete the booking request
via the platform. However, U.A. declined the invitation to extend sent to her by D.P. via the
platform.
 
4.       
On the same day, U.A. approached D.P. verbally and proposed a four-month tenancy.
D.P. reports being amenable
to the idea, but that the two could not come to agreement
on the terms including the amount of monthly rent and whether a last month’s
rent deposit would be required.
 
5.       
U.A. requested D.P. sign a standard
lease agreement with U.A.’s proposed
terms, which
D.P. refused.




 
6.       
D.P. attended the unit as asked when U.A. would be leaving, as the unit had been booked by another party.
 
7.       
U.A. filed a T2 application on April 2, 2020. That application (TET-10427-20) was scheduled to be heard at the same time as the Landlord’s
application.
 
8.       
U.A. vacated the unit on December
30, 2020.
 
9.       
It is D.P.’s position
that the Board has no jurisdiction to hear the T2 application, as the rental is
exempt from the Act pursuant to section 5(a).
 
10.    As the applicant D.P. did not attend, the T2 application was ordered abandoned.
 
Analysis:
 
1.       
The Act sets out certain exemptions in section 5, as follows: This Act does not apply with
respect to,
(a)  
living accommodation intended to
be provided to the travelling or vacationing public or occupied for a seasonal
or temporary period in a hotel, resort, lodge, tourist camp, cottage or cabin establishment, inn, campground, trailer
park, tourist home, bed and
breakfast vacation establishment or vacation home;
 
2.       
There are two points
to focus on in this analysis
– whether the initial agreement between the
parties was for a temporary rental, and whether that agreement changed.
 
3.       
On the question of whether
it was understood by both parties
to be a temporary rental, I find that it was. Using the Airbnb
platform to book for a specific, two-week
period paid in advance and to begin immediately all
support this position. There was no evidence presented to rebut this
presumption.
 
4.       
On the question of whether the initial agreement changed, I find that it did not. One party
of a tenancy agreement cannot unilaterally change
the nature of the agreement so as to
bring it in or take it out of the coverage
of the statute. [Cowie v. Bindlish
[2010] O.J. No. 2193 (Ont. Div. Ct.)] Changing the agreement would have
required a meeting of the minds, which I do not find occurred. While U.A. made
an offer, I find D.P. did not accept that offer either explicitly or
implicitly.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Act does not apply.
