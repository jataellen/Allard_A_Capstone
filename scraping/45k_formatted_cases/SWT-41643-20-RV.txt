In the matter

Between:


Tammy Sharpe


Tenant




 


and


 




 


Anna Bazala


Landlord



 
Order
 
Tammy Sharpe
(the 'Tenant') applied for an order determining that Anna Bazala (the
'Landlord') or the Landlord’s superintendent the Landlord’s agent, harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened
or interfered with the Tenant, substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenant or by a member
of the Tenant's household and withheld
or deliberately interfered with the reasonable supply of a vital service, care
service, or food that the Landlord is obligated to supply under the tenancy
agreement.
 
This application was resolved by order SWT-41643-20 issued on May 7, 2020. On June 1, 2020, the Tenant
requested a review of the order.
The Tenant also applied
for an order to determine whether the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
applies; to determine that the Landlord failed to meet the Landlord's
maintenance obligations under the Act or failed to comply with health, safety,
housing or maintenance standards; and to determine that the Landlord gave a
notice of termination in bad faith.
 
The Landlord
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the
Landlord’s child requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
The Tenant’s
review request and the applications were heard on May 21, 2021 and November
23, 2021.
 
The Tenant, the
Tenant’s representative, J. Kulokowski, the Landlord and the Landlord’s
representative, J. Sparling, attended the hearing on May 21, 2021. The Landlord’s witness (child), S Bazala (‘SB’),
also attended the hearing on May 21, 2021. Only the Landlord
and the Landlord’s
representative attended the hearing on November 24, 2021 when the matters were

SWT-42456-20 SWT-48471-21 SWT-44704-20 SWL-38877-19
 
called at 9:16AM. Neither
the Tenant nor the Tenant’s
representative attended the proceedings
for the remainder of the hearing block.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
At the May 21, 2021 hearing,
the Tenant withdrew
application file number SWT-42456-20
to determine whether the Act applies.
 
2.    
Because limitation
periods under the Act were suspended
for the period March 16, 2020 to September 14, 2020, the Board maintains jurisdiction over the Tenant’s T6 application
for the period beginning July 18, 2019.
 
3.    
The Landlord did not
pay the Tenant compensation under section 48.1 of the Act to terminate the tenancy for the Landlord’s own use. The Board therefore
lacks jurisdiction pursuant
to subsection 83(4) of the Act to grant the Landlord’s application.
 
4.    
Because the Tenant did
not attend the hearing to support
their request to review the May 7, 2020 Board Order, or their other applications, I find that the Tenant
has abandoned the request and the applications.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The request
to review order SWT-41643-20, issued
on May 7, 2020, is denied.
The order is confirmed and
remains unchanged.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s application to terminate
the tenancy for the Landlord’s child’s own use is
dismissed.
 
3.    
The Tenant’s
applications are dismissed.
