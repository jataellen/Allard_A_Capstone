Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-03600-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


505, 3131
JAGUAR VALLEY DRIVE MISSISSAUAGA ON L5A2J2


 




Between:


Fernwood Apartments Inc. Windor Courtjv


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Ryszard Grajko


Tenant



 
 
 
Fernwood Apartments Inc. Windor
Courtjv (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ryszard
Grajko (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant has been persistently late in
paying the Tenant's rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on February
10, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s representatives Kevin Anderson and Joe Bullas attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due. The Tenant
has not paid rent since November 2021.
 
2.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of February
25. The Tenant must move out
of the rental unit on or before February 25, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$1,320.75, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from January 1, 2022
to February 14, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $29.35 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from February 15, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.

5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
February 25, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 25, 2022, then starting February
26, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 26, 2022.
