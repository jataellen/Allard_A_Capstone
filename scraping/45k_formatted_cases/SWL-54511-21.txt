Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-54511-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1, 5534 LASSALINE AVENUE WINDSOR ON N8T1A9


 




Between:


Windsor Essex Community Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Tara
  McIntyre


Tenant



 
 
 
Windsor Essex Community Housing Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tara McIntyre (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 16, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Cameron Parrott, attended the hearing. As of 2:43 p.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from June 1, 2019 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective December
9, 2020.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $795.00 as of January
1, 2022.
 
4.    
The Tenant paid $444.00
after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
reminded the Tenant about the hearing.
 
6.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
7.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection




 
83(1) of the Act. The Landlord’s attempts at negotiating a repayment agreement
were unsuccessful.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the
Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before January 17, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $3,395.82*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 6, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay
to the Landlord $26.14 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 7, 2022 to the date the
Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 17, 2022, the
Tenant will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 18, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January 18, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
January 18, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 17, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $4,220.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be
terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or
after January 18, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
