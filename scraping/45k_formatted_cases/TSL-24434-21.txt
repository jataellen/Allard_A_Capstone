Metcap Living Management Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Purab Sarkar (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 12, 2022. The Landlord's Legal Representative, Sara Mathew and the
Tenant attended the hearing.

1.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.

4.    
The Tenant paid all arrears for the period
ending January 31, 2022 after the application was
filed.

The only amount outstanding is the Landlord's cost of filing the application. As a result, the order will be limited to

pay to the Landlord $112.53
for costs.
