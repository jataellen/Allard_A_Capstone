Angelo Tramonti,
Joe Tramonti and Nancy Tramonti (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict
Shannon Tyson and Sean Balek (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on December
8, 2021. Only the Landlords and the Agent Paul Mitchell attended
the hearing. As of 3:59 p.m., the Tenants were not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay
for the period from April 1, 2021 to
November 30, 2021. Because of the arrears,
the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective
July 12, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
vacated the rental
unit on November 5, 2021. The Tenants
were in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent was $1,800.00.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlords
collected a rent deposit of $1,800.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from May 1, 2019 to
July 12, 2021.
