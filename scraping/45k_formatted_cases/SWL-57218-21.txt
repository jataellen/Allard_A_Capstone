Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57218-21
 



In the matter
of:


89 MAUD STREET WOODSTOCK ON N4S3Y5


 




Between:


Alzahir Tharani
  Inayat Tharani


Landlords




 


and


 




 


Dale Kendell
  Lisa Irvine


Tenants



 
 
On November 17,
2021, Alzahir Tharani and Inayat
Tharani (the 'Landlords') applied for
an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Lisa Irvine and Dale
Kendell (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have
the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the Board on November 12, 2021 with respect to
application SWL-52527- 21 SA.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlords could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenants
if the Tenants did not meet certain
condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenants have not met the following
condition(s) specified in the order:
 
The Tenants failed
to pay to the Landlord
$2,000.00 on or before November
15, 2021 towards rent.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent.
The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the
arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlords are entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenants were
ordered to pay $8,701.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the
Landlord's application fee in Order
SWL-52527-21 SA. The amount that is still owing from that order is $6,451.00 and that
amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order
SWL-52527-21 SA is cancelled.
 
5.    
The Landlords collected a rent deposit of $2,000.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.




File Number: SWL-57218-21
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from March 20, 2020 to January 7, 2022.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Order SWL-52527-21 SA is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 18, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlords $6,448.99*. This amount
represents the rent owing up to December 14, 2021 and the costs related to the
application fee for the previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the rent
deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlords $65.75
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting December 15, 2021
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before January
18, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January
19, 2022, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after January 19, 2022.

The tenant has until January 17, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 17, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.
 
In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on July 19, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction
where the rental unit is located.
