Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-07861-18



 


 


 



 
 
XZ (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict RB (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on September 25,
2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant
attended the hearing.  The amount claimed on the application exceeds the
Board’s jurisdiction.  Therefore, the order is limited to the amount of
$25,000.00.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from November 1, 2017
to September 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination.
 
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $5,700.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
 
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 25, 2016 to October 5, 2018.
 
4.     
The Landlord is seeking a
standard termination order.  The Landlord said that she has been patient with
the Tenant who has provided many excuses for not paying the rent for a year,
and now seeks payment of the arrears, which exceed the jurisdiction of the
Board, or eviction of the Tenant.
 
5.     
The Tenant said that he has
lived in the rental unit, a house, for just over 2 years.  He does not contest
the amount of arrears owed.  The Tenant said that his primary income has been
from real estate deals, but all his deals in the past year have failed.  The
Tenant acknowledged that the Landlord has been very patient with him while his
business ventures have failed.  The Tenant said that he has a new roommate, who
has lived with him for a few months, who helps pay their expenses.  The Tenant
did not explain why he has not used any of the roommate’s money to pay anything
towards the rent.  The Tenant said that he believes there are a number of deals
he has in the works that will permit him to pay some of the arrears by
mid-October, 2018.  He has not looked for alternative accommodation because he
has no rent deposit money and does not have good credit at present.
 
6.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.  The Tenant
currently owes the Landlord an amount that exceeds the jurisdiction of the
Board.  He did not provide any reason for why he has not made any payment at
all, in good faith, towards the rent, despite having a roommate in the last few
months.  The Tenant did not propose a payment plan to pay down the arrears
besides hypothetical income that he might have in mid-October when the arrears
will have increased.  The Landlord has effectively subsidised the Tenant for a
year while receiving no rent to pay towards her own expenses.  I find that it
is severely prejudicial to the Landlord to grant a further postponement of
payment of such a substantial amount of arrears. 
 
It
is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before October
16, 2018.
 
2.     
The Tenant owes the Landlord
$25,432.97*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to
October 5, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.  However, the Tenant shall pay the Landlord $25,000.00, which is
the limit of the Board’s jurisdiction.
 
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $93.70 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
October 6, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before October 16, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
October 17, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before October 16, 2018, then starting October 17, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after October 17, 2018.
 
8.     
If, on or before October 16,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $25,175.00** to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after October 17, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
