Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57644-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


208, 471 TECUMSEH ROAD W WINDSOR ON
  N8X1G8


 




Between:


Marda Management Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Denny Derose


Tenant



 
 
 
Marda Management Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Denny Derose (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent
the Tenant owes because the
Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on
November 25, 2021 with respect to application SWL-53722-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $250.00 arrears on
or before January 1, 2022. The Tenant did not
pay $775.00 rent on or before January
1, 2022. The Tenant did not pay $500.00 on or before January 15, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $4,066.00 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
SWL-53722-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $3,816.00
and that amount is included
in this order. As a result,
the previous order
SWL-53722-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from January 1, 2022 to February 28, 2022.




File Number: SWL-57644-22
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SWL-53722-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 18, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$4,769.36* (less any amounts
paid by the Tenant to the Landlord since this application
was filed on January 21, 2022). This amount represents the rent owing up to
February 7, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the previous
application.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$25.48 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 8, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
18, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 18, 2022, then starting
February 19, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 19, 2022.
