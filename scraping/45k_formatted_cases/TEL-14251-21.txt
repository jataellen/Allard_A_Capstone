Landlords




 
 
and
 
Christopher O'Connor                                                                                                                 Tenant
 
 
 
Eric Puusa and Joanne
Puusa (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Christopher O'Connor (the 'Tenant') because
the Landlord requires
possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard by video conference on July 20, 2021, beginning
at 9:00 a.m..
 
The Landlords
attended the hearing.
As of 12:03 p.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at this
hearing although properly served with the notice of the hearing by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Landlords in good faith require
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation by a family
member.
 
2.       
On October 31, 2020 the Landlords served an N12 Notice to End Your Tenancy
with a termination date of December
31, 2020. The notice meets all of the requirements of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') in terms of form and content.
 
3.       
The Landlords also submitted a
declaration, but not a sworn affidavit, signed by the Landlords’ daughter H.P.,
stating that she will be occupying the Tenant’s unit for a minimum of one year.
Upon review of the declaration, I note that H.P. has not declared that she intends in good faith to take possession of the unit.
 
4.       
The Landlord E.P. affirmed that
the Landlords did not pay the Tenant compensation equal to one month's rent on
or before the termination date. Therefore,
the Landlords have not met the technical requirements of section 48.1 of the
Act, to make payment of the required compensation before the termination date in accordance with section 55.1 of
the Act.




File Number: TEL-14251-21
 
5.       
As a result, the Landlords’ application shall be dismissed
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1. The Landlords’ application is dismissed.
