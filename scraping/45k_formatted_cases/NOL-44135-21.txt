Greater Sudbury Housing
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Brandy
King-Kleinsteuber (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
13, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Melissa Chicoine, attended the hearing. As of 3:06 p.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
June 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective July 26,
2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
December 17, 2021. The Tenant
was in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $115.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of December
17, 2021, when the Tenant
returned vacant possession of
the rental unit to the Landlord.




File Number: NOL-44135-21
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $754.27*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to December 17, 2021.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
4, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 5, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
