Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number:
NOL-43959-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
UPPER, 320 ALGOMA
ST N THUNDER BAY ON P7A5B1


 




Between:


Michael Bolton


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


John Woods


Tenant



 
 
 
Michael Bolton (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict John Woods (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 13, 2022. Only the Landlord
attended the hearing. As of 10:36 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period from December 1, 2020 to January
31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 9,
2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     
The lawful monthly rent is $725.00.
 
4.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $650.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from December 1, 2017 to September 9, 2021.
 
6.     
The Tenant paid $5,986.00
after the application was filed.
 
7.     
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact
of COVID-19 on the parties
and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the
Tenant and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 20, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the
Act.

It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before February 20,
2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $335.94*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
20, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $23.84
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 21, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
20, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 21, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 20, 2022, then starting
February 21, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 21, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$1,450.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$2,175.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 20, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 21, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
