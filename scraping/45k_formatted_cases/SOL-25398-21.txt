Leanna Millar
  Mike Amyotte


Tenants



 
 
Gary Lemieux (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Leanna Millar and Mike Amyotte (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 22, 2022.
The Landlord and the Tenant, Leanna Millar, attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.     At the hearing,
it was discovered that the Landlord had served an invalid N4 notice to end
the tenancy for non-payment of rent.
 
2.     Since the Landlord’s application is based on an invalid N4 notice, the application cannot proceed before the Board.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
