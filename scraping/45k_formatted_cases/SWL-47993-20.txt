Angela Neville and Darryl Neville
(the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Stephanie Baron (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlords in a residential complex that has three or fewer residential units; because the
Landlord has entered into an agreement of purchase and sale of the rental unit
and the purchaser requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation; and because the Tenant,
another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused undue
damage to the premises. The Landlords has also applied for an order requiring
the Tenant to compensate the Landlords for the damage.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on November 29, 2021. Only the Landlord, Angela Neville,
attended the hearing.
As of 2:07 p.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on
September 30, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the
date the application was filed.
 
2.    
Therefore, the matter proceeded
on the damage claim only and not eviction.
 
Damage to the rental unit
 
3.    
The rental unit is townhouse condominium, approximately 1800 sq. ft., with 4
bedrooms and 2 bathrooms.




 
4.    
The Landlords
application claims that the Tenant
caused damage to the rental
unit estimated at $19,861.00.
 
5.    
Subsection 89(1)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) provides that a
landlord may apply to the board for the
tenant to pay reasonable costs
that the landlord has or will incur to repair or
replace damaged property where the tenant or their guest wilfully or
negligently cause undue damage to the rental unit.
 
6.    
The Landlord
testified that the front door and the glass sunlight of the rental unit was
kicked in several times by the Tenant’s guests. The repair of the door and the
glass sunlight had to be done by the condominium corporation at a cost to the
Landlord. The Tenant has caused damage to floors, removed a handrailing,
removed carpeting, damaged the drywall,
removed cupboard doors and drawers
from the kitchen, removed the basement washer and dryer,
“smashed” the basement bathroom cabinets, cracked the toilet, cracked the bath tub, removed drawers
and cupboard doors
from the upstairs bathroom, disconnected the toilet,
allowed their dog to defecate and urinate on the carpets upstairs, and
continuously stored garbage on the back deck which had to be removed by the
condo corporation at a cost to the Landlords.
 
7.    
By email dated
November 11, 2021, the Landlord submitted several pictures of the damage and
garbage in the back deck. The pictures show extensive damage, garbage and debris throughout the rental unit.
The Landlords also submit an invoice in the amount of $35,387.93 to repair or replace
the damage.
 
8.    
Based on the uncontested evidence and pictures, I am satisfied
that the Tenant wilfully
or negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit. Given the extent
of the damage, the size of the rental unit, and similar cases decided by the
Board, I find that the invoice submitted by the Landlord is reasonable.
Therefore, the Landlords are entitled to the following amounts for the damaged
items:
 
a.   
Carpet install ($4,576.50).
 
b.   
Paint and drywall repair
($3,450.00).
 
c.   
Exterior doors ($2,542.50).
 
d.   
Bath vanities ($2,789.50).
 
e.   
Bathroom toilets ($700.00).
 
f.    
Garbage clean associated with the repairs
($750.00).
 
g.   
Trim and doors ($4,300.00).




 
9.    
The total amount that the Landlords
are entitled to is $19,108.50.
 
10. 
The Landlords did
not submit pictures or give sufficient evidence to substantiate their claim for damage to the
lighting, kitchen, vinyl flooring, or mold remediation. Accordingly, these costs are denied.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of September 30, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlords.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords
$19,108.50, which represents the reasonable costs
of repairing the damage or replacing the damaged property.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
The total amount the Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
is $19,309.50.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount
owing on or before February
15, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
