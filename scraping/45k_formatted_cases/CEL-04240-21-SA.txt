In the matter
of:


107, 149 TUPPER
STREET E ALLISTON ON L9R1G2


 




Between:


Jasmar Investments Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Donald Regimbald
  Susan Regimbald


Tenants



 
 
 
Jasmar
Investments Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Susan Regimbald and Donald Regimbald (the 'Tenants') and for an order
to have the Tenants pay the rent they
owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on July 19, 2021 with
respect to application CEL-98641-21.
 
The Landlord's
application was resolved by order CEL-04240-21, issued on January 17, 2022. The
Tenants filed a motion to set aside order CEL-04240-21.
 
This motion
was heard by video conference on February 16, 2022. The Landlord’s Agents, D.
Reid, and T. Fossett, and the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     Order CEL-98641-21 provided that the Landlord could
apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain conditions specified in the order.
 
2.     The Landlord filed the application under section 78 of
the Act, alleging that the Tenants failed to pay arrears of $525.00 on or
before November 20, 2021, contrary to the order. This resulted in ex parte
order CEL-04240-21 terminating the tenancy.
 
3.    
In support of the motion to set aside the order, the Tenants
stated that they failed to make the payments because of issues
regarding their pension. The Tenants have since January 13, 2022, caught up with the payments as stipulated in order CEL-98641-21. The Tenants are seniors who have resided in the rental unit for
three years.




File Number: CEL-04240-21-SA
 
4.    
The Landlord opposed the Tenants’
motion stating that the Tenants make the same excuse about their pension all
the time and missed payments are an ongoing pattern for the Tenants.
 
5.    
Although the
Tenants breached the order, section 78(11)(b) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 provides that the Board shall set aside the eviction order if the Board is
satisfied, having regard to all the circumstances, that it would not be unfair
to do so. The Tenants have ultimately brought their payments in line with order CEL-98641-21, and in this circumstance, I
find it would not be unfair to set aside the order.
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The motion to set aside Order CEL-04240-21, issued on
January 17, 2022 is granted. The
order cannot be enforced by the Landlord.
 
2.     The order issued by the Board on July 19, 2021 with
respect to application CEL-98641- 21, continues in effect.
