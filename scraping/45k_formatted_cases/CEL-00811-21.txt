In the
  matter of:


UNIT 4, 16 WEST
STREET S ORILLIA ON L3V5G3


 




Between:


2504375 Ontario Inc.


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Erin Teachout


Tenant



 
 
2504375 Ontario Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Erin Teachout (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 24, 2022. As of 2:14 p.m., the Tenant
was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board. The Landlord's Legal Representative, Ciara
McMillen attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from June 1, 2020 to August 31, 2021.
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective June 9, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful monthly rent is $500.00.
 
4.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $750.00
from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from May 1, 2018 to
June 9, 2021.
 
6.    
The Tenant made no payments after the application was filed.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 19, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $9,378.41*, which represents the
amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
8, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$16.44 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 9, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 19, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 20, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 19, 2022, then starting February
20, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 20, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 19, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $10,686.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full
and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act
to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection
on or after February 20, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period
of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
