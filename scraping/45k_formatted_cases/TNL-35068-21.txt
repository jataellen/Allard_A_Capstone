IMH POOL XII LP (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Damulira Mayombwe
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
24, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Sharon Harris, attended the hearing. As of 9:29 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
24, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
October 12, 2021. The Tenant
was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was
filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $2,225.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,225.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit
has been paid to the Tenant for the period
from July 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
October 12, 2021. The Tenant
was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was
filed.

2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,735.65*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to October 12, 2021, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
11, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 12, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
