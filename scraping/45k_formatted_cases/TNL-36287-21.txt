Between:

Landlord




 


and


 




 


Michael
Dignard


Tenant



 
On November
16, 2021, Houselink And Mainstay Community (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Michael Dignard (the
'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes
because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on September 27,
2021 with respect to application TNL-32791-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed to pay to the Landlord
$115.00 on or before November
1, 2021 towards rent.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in
addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $286.00 for rent arrears and NSF cheque charges and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order TNL-32791-21. That amount is included in this order. As a result,
the previous order TNL-32791-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from October 1,
2021 to November 30, 2021.
 
6.    
Since the date of the order,
the Landlord incurred
charges of $20.00
for cheques tendered by or on
behalf of the Tenant which were returned NSF.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TNL-32791-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 21, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$536.00*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to November 30, 2021 and the total charges related to NSF cheques
tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant and the costs related to
the application fee for the previous application.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord
$3.78 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting December 1, 2021 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
21, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 21, 2022, then starting January
22, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 22, 2022.

The tenant has until January 20, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 20, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on July 22, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction
where the rental unit is located.
