Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-56212-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


209, 435 GREY STREET LONDON ON N6B1H2


 




Between:


Capreit Limited Partnership


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Darien Slade


Tenant



 
 
Capreit Limited Partnership (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Darien Slade (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 3, 2022. The
Landlord's Legal Representative, Ayden Pearson attended the hearing. As of 3:14 p.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
July 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
As of February 1, 2022,
the lawful monthly rent for the unit is
$1,140.52.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,127.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period from February
1, 2021 to February 1, 2022.
 
6.    
The Tenant paid $4,508.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 7, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$2,448.00*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 24, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$37.50 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 25, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before March 7, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from March 8, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 7, 2022, then starting
March 8, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 8, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust:
i)  $4,001.52 if the payment is made on or before February 28, 2022, or
ii)  $5,142.04 if the payment is made on or before March 7, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March
8, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
