Ferreira and Paulo Ferreira (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by

the hearing. As of 1:57 p.m., the Tenants
were not present or represented at the hearing although properly served with

14, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 11, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on October
2, 2021. The Tenants were in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $2,200.00.
 
4.    
The Tenants have made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $2,200.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.

is owing to the Tenants
for the period
