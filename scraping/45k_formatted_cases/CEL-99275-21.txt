Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-99275-21



In the matter
of:


1014, 310 BURNHAMTHORPE ROAD WEST
  MISSISSAUGA ON L5B4P9


 




Between:


Platinum Suites
Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Saba Asady


 
Tenant



 
 
Platinum Suites Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Saba Asady
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video
conference on February 7, 2022.
 
The Landlord's Agents, Sarosh
Iqbal & Reena Mehrotra, the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Dara Saunders, and the Tenant attended
the hearing.
 
Preliminary Issues:
 
1.   
The Tenant denied receiving the N4
notice of termination. She also said that it was impossible to slide something
under her door, which is how the document was served according to the
certificate of service. The Tenant submitted photographs to support her allegation
that a document could not be slid under her door, however, the photographs did
not demonstrate that a document
could not be slid under
her door. Reena
Mehrotra testified that she
was able to slide the notice under the Tenant's door and that this was how she
served it on the Tenant. The
Landlord’s Agent, Sarosh Iqbal, testified that the Tenant phoned him after receiving the notice of termination to discuss it and to ask if she was being
taken to court. I find, on a balance of probabilities based on the evidence
before me, that the Tenant was served with the notice of termination.
 
2.   
The Tenant also raised issues under
section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, (the
‘Act’). The Landlord acquiesced to the Tenant's monetary claim in the amount of
$250.00 and the Tenant shall be credited this amount. I also find it appropriate, based on the evidence
before me, to order the Landlord to inspect the freezer door and make any necessary
repairs to it and to repair
the holes in the walls within 30 days of this order. I do not find it appropriate to grant the Tenant's other
requested remedy (i.e. to order the Landlord to respond if there is future
water damage) as the Landlord is already obliged to comply with the maintenance obligations under the Act.
 
3.   
With respect to relief from
eviction, the Tenant said that her monthly income consisted of disability tax
credit and that it was not enough to pay the ongoing rent. She said her family




 
was trying to sell a home outside the country and that she intended to pay the Landlord with proceeds from the sale, however, she did not identify when this was
expected to occur and
I did not find it appropriate to grant relief from eviction based on the
speculation of a sale. Under these circumstances, it is not possible to preserve the tenancy. I find it appropriate to grant
a very modest delay in the eviction
date to February
28, 2022 given the Tenant's
health conditions. I do not think
it would be fair to grant any further delay
in the eviction date given that the amount of the arrears is very
near the monetary jurisdiction of the Board and given the history of rental payments.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
November 1, 2020 to October 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective March 19,
2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful monthly rent is $2,425.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
 
5.    
The Tenant paid $3,450.00
after the application was filed.
 
6.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until February 28, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the
Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant
voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before February 28, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $32,585.15*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February 14,
2022, less the $250.00 rent abatement.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $79.73 per day for
compensation for the use of the unit
starting February 15, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before February 28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2022, then starting
March 1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.




 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before February 28,
2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $33,886.00** to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after March 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this
motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
