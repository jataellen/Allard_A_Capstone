Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-22407-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


14 KENWOOD CRESCENT GUELPH ON N1H6E5


 




Between:


Brenda Flanigan


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Andrew Mcmahon


Tenant



 
 
 
Brenda Flanigan
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Andrew
Mcmahon (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered
with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlord in a residential complex that has three or fewer residential units; and because
the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or a person the Tenant permitted in the
residential complex has seriously impaired the safety of any person.
 
This application was heard by way of videoconference on December 15, 2021. The landlord and the
Tenant attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s application is based on an N7 notice
of termination served
on the Tenant June 14, 2021 with a termination date of June 24, 2021.
 
2.     The notice of termination identifies the address
of the rental unit as follows:
14 Kenwood Crescent, Guelph, Ontario, N1H 6E5
3.    
The property
is a single detached dwelling. The Tenant on this application resides in the recreational room located in the
basement. The Tenant has his own
kitchen and bathroom in the said rental unit.
 
4.    
The Landlords N7 notice does not
identify the basement rental unit for which the
notice is given. The
Landlord’s L2 application also did not identify the rental unit.




File Number: SOL-22407-21
 
 
 
5.    
Section 43(1)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, (the
Act) states
 
43 (1) Where this Act permits
a landlord or tenant to give a notice of termination, the notice shall be in a form approved by
the Board and shall,
(a)     identify
the rental unit for which
the notice is given.
(b)    
state the date on which the tenancy is to terminate; and
(c)     be signed by the person giving
the notice, or the person’s
agent. [emphasis added]
 
6.    
The Landlord’s N7 notice is defective as it does not comply
with Section 43(1)(a)
of the Act. As the notice of termination is defective
on it’s face, the Board does not have the jurisdiction to terminate the
tenancy.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.    The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
