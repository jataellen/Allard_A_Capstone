Tenants



 
 
 
Heather Fuller (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Garfield Yackobeck and Rebecca Fluery
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 11, 2022. Only the Landlord attended the hearing. As of
2:18pm, the Tenants were not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from December 1, 2020 to January
31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 15, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
vacated the rental
unit on July 17, 2021.
The Tenants were in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $740.00.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $740.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
31, 2018 to July 15, 2021.




File Number: EAL-97755-21
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of July 17, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $4,822.93*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to July 17, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do
not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
January 31, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 1,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
