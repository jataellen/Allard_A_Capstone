Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-54663-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


2, 15 SARAH
CRESCENT CHATHAM ON N7M5R1


 




Between:


Flori Goldfeder Vladislav Goldfeder Erica Lima
Igor Tumanenko


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Pamela
Ann Broughton


Tenant



 
 
 
Flori Goldfeder, Vladislav Goldfeder, Erica
Lima and Igor Tumanenko (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Pamela Ann Broughton
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 20, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Zeeshan Rahman, attended the hearing. As
of 9:40 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
May 29, 2020 to December 28, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective August
25, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,550.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant
has made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.    
 The Landlords collected a rent deposit of $1,550.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from August 30, 2020 to August 25, 2021.




 
7.    
I have
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the parties and whether
the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 18, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlords $14,704.93*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 7, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlords $50.96
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 8, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before January
18, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 19, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January
19, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after January 19, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 18, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $17,436.00** to the Landlords
or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would
not be terminated and the Tenant could
remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time,
the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
19, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
