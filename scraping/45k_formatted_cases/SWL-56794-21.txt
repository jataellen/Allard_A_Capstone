In the matter
of:


N3,
84 FREDERICK STREET KITCHENER ON N2H2L7


 




Between:


YW Kitchener-waterloo


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Cherie Haufe


Tenant



 
 
 
YW Kitchener-waterloo (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Cherie Haufe (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord intends to convert the rental
unit to a non- residential use.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 10, 2022.
Only the Landlord’s representative,
Abla Tsolu attended the hearing. Background
1.    
The unit in question
is part of a complex
which is a women’s emergency shelter that also contains rental units for vulnerable
individuals. The Landlord’s representative is one of the coordinators of the
program and provided evidence that the complex is being expanded for additional
emergency shelter space.
 
2.     As a result, the agreement between the Landlord and
the Region of Waterloo is transitioning. The Landlord
intends on transitioning the Tenant to a new unit located
at a new complex located at
1470 Blockline Road in Kitchener.
 
3.    
While the new complex
is still under construction, the Landlord advised
that the Tenant will be transitioned to the new
unit once the work is complete.
 
4.     The Landlord’s representative has requested that the
termination date be extended to March 31st, 2022 however, she advised that the Tenant
will remain in the complex
until the new unit construction is complete and fully furnished.
 
Determinations:




 
5.    
I find as a fact that the residential complex is currently an emergency women’s
shelter that also includes rental units in which the Tenant currently
resides.
 
6.     I also find that the
Landlord, in collaboration with the municipality, plan on expanding the emergency shelter which in turn, would involve
the utilization of the space currently being used to residential units.
 
7.     I find further
that elimination of the rental
units for the purpose of the emergency women’s shelter will convert the complex to a non-residential use. The conversion does not require any building permits.
 
8.    
The Tenant never attended
the hearing, as the Landlord’s representative provided
evidence that the Tenant is a member of a vulnerable population.
 
9.     The Landlord’s representative testified that the
Tenant will be provided with alternative housing once the construction of the
Tenant’s new unit is complete. The Landlord has requested that the termination date be extended
to March 31st, 2022. If the construction
of the Tenant’s new unit is not completed by that date, the Tenant will remain in the old unit until it is. I am satisfied that this is the Landlord’s
intent and that the Tenant will not be left without housing until the
construction is complete.
 
10.  As such, I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would
not be unfair to postpone the eviction until March 31st, 2022
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
11.  The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
March 31st, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the
rental unit on or before March 31, 2022.
 
12.  If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 31, 2022, then starting
April 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
13. 
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after April 1, 2022.
