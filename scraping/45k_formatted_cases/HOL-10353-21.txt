In the matter
of:


401, 140 MAIN
STREET W HAMILTON ON L8P0B8


 




Between:


140 Main St Holdings Inc C/O Quadreal Residential Properties G.P Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Ya-Chu (Rita) Chang Ya-Ting (Anita) Chang


Tenants



 
 
140 Main St Holdings Inc C/O Quadreal Residential Properties
G.P Inc (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ya-Ting (Anita) Chang and
Ya-Chu (Rita) Chang (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent
that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 14, 2021. The Landlord’s Agent, Vanessa Sullivan,
and Legal Representative Faith McGregor attended the hearing. As of 9:38 a.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from February
1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective March 25, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $2,513.09.
 
4.    
The Tenants
paid $2,513.09 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord sent an
email to the Tenants on the necessity of a repayment agreement. The Landlord’s
attempts at negotiating a repayment agreement were unsuccessful.
 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $2,513.09 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent
deposit has been paid to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2020 to
December 31, 2020.




 
8.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act. The
amount outstanding is substantial, and the Tenants have not paid more than one
month’s rent since the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental
unit on or before January 15, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $20,586.07*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 4, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $82.62 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 5, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 15, 2022, the
Tenants will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January 16, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
January 16, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 15, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $25,316.90** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenants
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after January 16,
2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants
are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
