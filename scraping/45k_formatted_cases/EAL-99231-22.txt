Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-99231-22
 



In the
  matter of:


43 RAILWAY STREET LANSDOWNE ON K0E1L0


 




Between:


Sean Woodland


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Jason Rasenberg Jennifer Lafreniere


Tenants



 
On January 19, 2022, Sean
Woodland (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jennifer
Lafreniere and Jason Rasenberg (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants entered into an
agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord and the Tenants
signed an agreement
to terminate the tenancy as of
January 31, 2022.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenants to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 11, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 11, 2022, then starting February
12, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 12, 2022.

The tenant has until February 10, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 77(6) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by February 10, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.
