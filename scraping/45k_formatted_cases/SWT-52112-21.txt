Order under Section
57
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWT-52112-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


2,
60 CORNELL AVENUE KITCHENER ON N2G3E4


 




Between:


Helen Benson


Tenant




 


 
and


 




 


Christine Lassel


Landlord



 
 
 
Helen Benson (the 'Tenant')
applied for an order determining that Christine Lassel (the
'Landlord'), gave a notice of termination in bad faith.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 17, 2022.
The Tenant and the Landlord attended the hearing.
1.    
The Tenant alleges that on April 29th, 2020, the Landlord
had served her a notice to end her tenancy to allow the Landlord’s parents to move into the rental unit in bad
faith. The Tenant moved out of
the unit on August 31st, 2020.
 
2.     In order for the Tenant’s
application to succeed,
I am required to find on a balance of probabilities that the notice issued by
the Landlord was done so in bad faith in accordance with s. 57(1) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”).
 
3.    
Pursuant to s. 57(1) of the Act, the facts that the Tenant
must establish to succeed in this
application are:
 
•      
the Landlord gave a notice
of termination under s.
48 of the Act in bad faith;
•      
The Tenants vacated the rental unit as a result of the notice
of termination; and
•       No
person referred to in clause
48(1) of the Act occupied
the rental unit within a reasonable amount of time after the
Tenants vacated the rental unit.
 
4.    
For the following reasons
I find on a balance of
probabilities that the Landlord has
discharged their onus and has proven that the application was made in good faith.
 
Reasons




 
5.    
The Tenant testified that 4 months
after received the Notice of Termination from the Landlord, she vacated the unit and found a new unit for September
1st, 2020, living
with her daughter and another roommate.
 
6.     She testified that on March 1st, 2021 she had found an online advertisement for the rental unit. It appeared to her that the
unit had been renovated and was
being advertised for a higher rent.
 
7.    
The N12 Notice of Termination the Tenant received
with respect to the rental
unit indicated that the Landlord’s parents had planned to move into the
unit.
 
8.     The Tenant submitted that because the unit was being
advertised for rent less than 1 year from the date in which she vacated
the unit, the Landlord had submitted the notice of termination in bad faith.
 
9.     She testified that the 4 months between
receiving the notice
and moving into her new unit
were very stressful, especially
during a pandemic. She testified further that she had been living with her daughter in the rental unit to help
with rent and that both her and her daughter had to bring in a 3rd
roommate to help pay rent in their new unit.
 
10. 
The Tenant sought remedies
for her application, namely the difference in rent that both
her and her daughter were paying for the new unit and a Board fine.
 
11.  The Landlord submitted
that she issued the notice of termination to the Tenant to
allow for her elderly parents to move into the unit. The location of the unit
was ideal, as the Landlord’s parents would
have been closer
to her and other family members
who could provide them
support.
 
12.  After the Tenant had vacated the unit, she undertook
renovations to ensure the unit was adequate for parent’s
various needs. She testified that she was paid no rent from anyone
while this work was taking place and had expected her parents to be able to
move into the unit by December 1st, 2020.
 
13.  The Landlord’s parents were moving from their rural
home outside of Kitchener into the City. By November 2020, COVID-19 case counts
had started increasing in the City and on November 6th, 2020, the Landlord’s parents had given notice to the Landlord
that they were changing
their minds about
moving into the unit,
but had paid rent for the months
of December 2020, and January 2021 as they were supposed to move in
December 1st.
 
14.  While disappointed, the Landlord did not re-rent the
unit hoping that her parents might change their minds. By March 2021, she
testified that she had felt she waited long enough and decided to advertise the unit for rent. She found a tenant for April 1st, 2021.
 
15.  While I can certainly appreciate that the Tenant dealt with struggles in having to move out of the unit, the test for the
application to succeed is whether the Notice of Termination was made in bad
faith.




 
16.  The Landlord’s parents did not move into the unit on
September 1st, 2020. The Landlord required time to renovate
the unit for the purposes
of moving her parents in for December 1st, 2020. Although that represents a delay of 3 months, I find the delay reasonable
in the circumstances. The Landlords
parents were moving from their rural home to an apartment in the City. The
Tenant had lived in the unit for 18 years prior to vacating the unit and the
Landlord required the time to renovate within the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
17.  On November 6th, 2020, nearly a month before
the Landlord’s parents were supposed to take possession of the unit, they
changed their mind. The did so because they did not want to leave their rural home and with the COVID-10
pandemic case counts increasing,
they did not want to risk moving into the City.
 
18.  I find this explanation reasonable in the circumstances. Since March 2020 most of the
province and country have lived with a certain sense of uncertainty in these
quickly evolving times. I find that
this was a circumstance that the
Landlord did not anticipate herself being in.
 
19.  The Landlord was paid rent by her parents for the months of December
and January out of a courtesy to their daughter. In
the hopes of her parents changing her mind, the Landlord did not advertise the
unit for rent until March 2021.
 
20. 
As such,
I find the Landlord’s evidence
to be credible and reliable
with respect to her
explanation as to why her parents did not move into the unit.
 
21.  Further, I find that the Landlord had served the Notice of Termination upon the Tenant in
April of 2020, that she did so in good faith and as a result of circumstances
beyond her control she was unable to secure the tenancy of her parents in the
unit.
 
22. 
As such,
I find that the Tenants
application has not been proven
on a balance of
probabilities that the Landlord’s Notice of Termination was served in good
faith.
 
It is ordered that:
 
23.  The Tenant's application is dismissed.
