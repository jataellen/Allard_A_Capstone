Order under Section 31

File Number: SOT-19305-21
 
 
In the matter of:      2, 13B FIRE LANE ROAD E
NIAGARA-ON-THE LAKE ON L0S1J0
 




Between:                  Sharon Foertier Mauricio Larromana


Tenants




 
 
and
 




2482705 Ontario Inc.
Maxima Holdings Corporation
Dylan Earl


Landlords




 
 
 
Sharon Foertier and Mauricio
Larromana (the 'Tenants') applied for an order determining that Dylan Earl, 2482705 Ontario Inc. and Maxima Holdings
Corporation (the 'Landlords') substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment of the rental unit by Tenants or by a member of their household.
 
This application was scheduled by videoconference on October 13, 2021 at 9am . The Tenants and the Landlords attended
the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Tenant lives is a community
of cottages that are separated
approximately 40ft in distance from each other.
2.       
The Tenant claimed that for
the last 3 years an adjacent cottage has tenants that have been smoking marijuana outside
which has substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment of their rental unit.
3.       
The Landlord testified that he
made numerous accommodations to the Tenants including adding silicone
to the windows and adding a charcoal
filter to the ventilation system
of the rental unit.
4.       
It is clear that the use of
marijuana by Tenants on the grounds of a residential complex, which is currently classified as a controlled but legal product
is not a grounds for eviction,
short of any terms in a lease prohibiting smoking on the grounds of the
residential complex.
5.       
Therefore, I find that the
Landlords did not substantially interfere with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental
unit or residential complex by the Tenants or by a member of their
household.
