Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-21140-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1, 63 DREW STREET OSHAWA ON L1H 5A2


 




Between:


Anna MacInnes


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Natasha
Archer


Tenant



 
 
 
Anna MacInnes
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Natasha Archer (the 'Tenant')
and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a
condition specified in the order issued by the Board on October 19, 2021 with
respect to application TEL-17861-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The
Tenant did not pay the full monthly rent, nor $300.00 (arrears), on or before
November 1, 2021.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or
all the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $13,236.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
TEL-17861-21. The amount
that is still owing from that
order is $12,186.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result,
the previous order TEL-17861-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed
to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from November 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.




 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,350.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 1, 2019 to January 7, 2022.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TEL-17861-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 18, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$12,765.54*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to January 7, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $44.38
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 8, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January
18, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January
19, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 19, 2022.

The tenant has until January 17, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 17, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.




 
In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on July 19, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction
where the rental unit is located.
