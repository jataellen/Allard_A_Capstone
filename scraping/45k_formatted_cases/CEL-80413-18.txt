Order under Section 16.1 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-80413-18-IN
 










 
 
 

INTERIM ORDER 
 
SSA
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict DH
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Mississauga on November 21, 2018.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord's Legal Representative, Ms. P and the
Tenant attended the hearing.
 
At the commencement of the hearing the Landlord's Legal
Representative and the Tenant each raised preliminary issues.  The Landlord's
Legal Representative requested an adjournment. The Tenant filed an affidavit in
support of his request to have the Landlord L2 applications dismissed and also
alleged that he had not been served with a copy of the Notice of Hearing and
the application.  
 
I dismissed the Landlord’s request for an adjournment.  It is the
Landlord’s application and the Landlord is required to come prepared to
proceed.  
 
Determinations of the Preliminary Issue
 
Service of the Notice of Hearing –
 
1.   
 The Landlord was required to serve the Tenant with a copy of the
Notice of Hearing in addition to service by the Board.  The Landlord did not
file a certificate of service but confirmed during the hearing that he had
served the Tenant and he supported his oral testimony with a photograph on his
phone which the Tenant conceded appeared to be the same the package.  
 
2.   
I am satisfied that the Tenant was served with a copy of the
notice of hearing either by the Board or by the Landlord because he attended
the hearing and was able to make submissions in support of his preliminary
issues.
 
Landlord’s
L2/N7 application:
 
3.   
The Tenant asked that the Landlord’s application be dismissed
because it was filed with the Board more than 30 after the termination date
listed on the N7 Notice.  The N7 Notice has a termination date of August 12,
2018 but the application was not filed with the Board until October 17, 2018.  Section 69(2)
of Residential Tenancies Act, 2006(Act) provides that a landlord must
file an L2 eviction application by no later than 30 days after the termination
date specified in the notice. Therefore, I cannot
consider the merits of the allegations contained in the N7 notice and must
dismiss the L2 application. 
 
4.   
As I have not considered the Landlord’s L2 application on
its merits, the Landlord is not precluded from serving a new notice of termination
addressing the same allegations. 
 
Landlord’s
L1/N4
 
5.   
The Tenant argued the Landlord’s L1 application for rent arrears could
not proceed because the Landlord had not served him properly and also the
Tenant wished to raise several claims pursuant to section 82 of the Act.  The
Landlord’s representative asked for an order on the N4 because I heard the
Landlord’s evidence and the Landlord had established that the rent is owed. 
 
6.   
As set out above, I find that the Tenant was served. 
 
7.   
The Landlord has established that the Tenant has not paid the
entire rent he was lawfully required to pay for the period August 7, 2018 to
November 7, 2018. 
 
8.   
The Tenant suffers from many health issues including GAD and other
mental health issues.  He requested accommodation in the form an adjournment
request and I granted his request.  
 
9.   
In order to preserve each party’s rights until we can have full
hearing on the merits of the Tenant’s s. 82 claims, the Tenant will be required
to pay the arrears of $355.00 into the Board’s trust account. 
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.   
The Landlord’s L2 application is dismissed without prejudice.
 
2.   
The Tenant shall pay the amount of $355.00 into the Board on or
before December 4, 2018.
 
 
 
3.   
If the Tenant fails to make the payment required in paragraph 2,
then the pursuant to sections 195(1) and 195(4) of the Act the Tenant is
precluded from making any submissions to Board until the sum is paid.
