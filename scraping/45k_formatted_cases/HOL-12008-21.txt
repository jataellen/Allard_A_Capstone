Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number: HOL-12008-21




 
In the matter
  of:


 
43 CROWS NEST LANE N BOWMANVILLE ON L1C4A9


 




Between:


Ahmad El-Bakistany


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Blake Young


Tenant



 
 
 
Ahmad El-Bakistany (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Blake Young (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires possession
of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 21, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s Legal
Representative, Abdalla Al-Baalaway, and the Landlord attended the hearing. As of 9:53 a.m. the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
On September 9, 2021, the Landlord
served an N12 Notice of Termination (the “N12 Notice”) on the Tenant.
The N12 Notice provides the Landlord and his spouse
intend to move into the
rental unit and occupy it for at least one year. The date of termination is
November 30, 2021.
 
Affidavit and disclosure of prior N12 and N13 notices:
 
2.       
Section 71.1 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”), which came into force on
September 1, 2021, requires the Landlord to file an affidavit or declaration
from the person(s) who personally intends to occupy the rental unit and to
provide certain information about all N12 and N13 notices served in the
previous two years with the Landlord’s application. If this is not done, the
Act provides the Board must refuse to accept the application.
 
3.       
By endorsement dated November
26, 2021, the Landlord was ordered to file the affidavit
or declaration from the person(s) who personally intends
to occupy the rental unit and to
provide information about previous N12 and N13 notices by December 3, 2021.




 
4.       
The Board’s records indicate
the Landlord complied
with the endorsement by submitting the
required materials on December 3, 2021. Further, the Board’s records show that
when the Tenant was served with the Landlord’s application, this information
was included.
 
5.       
As a result, I find the Landlord has complied with their obligations under section 71.1.
 
6.       
The Landlord previously served an
earlier N12 notice for this same rental unit but the resulting application, HOL-11233-21 was dismissed due to an improper termination date. The Board’s records indicate the current application was
first filed the same day application HOL-11233-21 was heard.
 
The Landlord in good faith intends
to reside in the rental unit for one year
 
7.       
Based on the uncontested evidence of the Landlord, I find the Landlord in good faith requires the rental unit for
residential occupation for a period of at least one year.
 
8.       
The Landlord is currently renting
an apartment with his wife. He testified he and his spouse wish to move into the rental unit as once the Tenant
ceased paying rent he could not afford to both pay the mortgage
on the rental unit and rent his own accommodation.
 
9.       
This accords with the declaration
sworn by the Landlord dated December 2, 2021. The declaration also provides the Landlord intends
to reside in the rental
unit for at least one year.
 
10.    The fact that the N12 previously served by the
Landlord was dismissed due to an improper termination date does not undermine the Landlord’s evidence
respecting his genuine
intention to move into the rental unit.
 
Compensation
 
11.   
The Landlord testified he paid the
Tenant compensation equal to one month's rent on November 24, 2021 when he sent an e-transfer to the Tenant
and the Tenant accepted it. This was prior to the termination date
in the N12 Notice. As a result, I find the Landlord has satisfied their
obligation under section 48.1 of the Act.
 
12.    The Landlord is not holding
a last month’s rent on deposit.
 
Section 83 Considerations
 
13.   
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
14.    The Landlord is uncertain whether
the Tenant is still in possession.
 
15.    The Landlord testified the Tenant used to respond
to communications regularly but has not responded
in the past three to four weeks. When the Landlord went to inspect the




 
rental unit he observed the lock
had been changed and a number of factors which suggested to him the Tenant had
left the rental unit. These include that the blinds and furniture were removed and newspapers were stacked up on the front porch;
however, he also noted some
stacked clothing.
 
16.    The Landlord seeks
an order for eviction. He would like to move into the rental unit as soon as
possible and has already twice made arrangements with his own landlord to
extend his current tenancy.
 
17.    The Landlord’s wife is currently a student and he is
the only one who is working. He works as a contractor and works mainly in the summer and has had to take a loan from
family members.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of February
15, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 15, 2022.
 
2.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 15, 2022, then starting February
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 16, 2022.
