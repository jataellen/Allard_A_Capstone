Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55382-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


2, 433 WATERLOO STREET LONDON ON N6B2P1


 




Between:


Elleyr Investments Limited Frances Shapiro Realty


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Charles Davis Randy
Counter


Tenants



 
 
 
Elleyr
Investments Limited and Frances Shapiro Realty (the 'Landlords') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict Charles Davis and Randy Counter (the 'Tenants')
because they have been persistently late in paying their rent.
 
This
application was heard via videoconference on January 24, 2022. Only the
Landlords’ legal representative, C. Dawdy,
attended the hearing.
As of 10:43 a.m., the Tenants were not present
or represented although properly served with notice of this hearing by
the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
The Landlord applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants because the Tenants persistently
failed to pay rent when it was due. The Landlord served on the Tenants an N8
notice to terminate on August 17, 2021.
 
2.    Rent is due on the first of each
month.
 
3.   
As per the N8 Notice, the Tenants
had not paid rent in full by the first of the month twelve times in twelve
months.
 
4.   
The Tenants have persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
5.   
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1).
 
6.   
The Landlord’s representative disclosed that the Tenants
were late in paying the rent every month after the notice was served.
The Tenants are also in arrears of more than $6,000.00.
This is not a positive
consideration. The Tenants
were not present
to disclose any

circumstances for me to consider
delaying or denying eviction. As such, relief will not be granted.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlords
and the Tenants is terminated, as of February 21, 2022. The Tenants must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 21, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing on or before February 21, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated
from February 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit
is not vacated on or before February 21, 2022, then starting February 22, 2022, the Landlords may file this
order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
5.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlords on or after February 22, 2022.
