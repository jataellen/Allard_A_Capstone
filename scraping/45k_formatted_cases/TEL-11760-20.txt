File Number: TEL-11760-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


912, 5 GLAMORGAN AVENUE TORONTO ON M1P4P1


 




Between:


5 Glamorgan Co-ownership Residences Corp.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Keisha
George


Tenant



 
 
5 Glamorgan
Co-ownership Residences Corp. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Keisha
George (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 22, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord attended
the hearing. The Landlord
was represented by Bryan Rubin.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
July 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 22,
2020.
 
2.    
The Tenant
is in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful monthly rent increased to $1,560.59 effective October 1, 2020.
 
4.    
The Tenant
paid $18,820.49 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The arrears
and costs owing to December
31, 2021 total $8,428.36.
 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,500.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from October 1, 2018 to July 22, 2020.
 
8.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the
parties and whether the Landlord
attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would
be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection




 
83(1) of the Act. The Landlord
is unaware of any circumstances that would justify
relief from eviction.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 16, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$6,765.87*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to
January 5, 2022, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$51.31 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 6, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
16, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January
17, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 17, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 16, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $9,988.95** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be
terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
17, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant
is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
