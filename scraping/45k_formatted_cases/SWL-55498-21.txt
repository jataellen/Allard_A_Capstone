In the matter
of:


3445 BLOOMFIELD ROAD WINDSOR ON N9C1R6


 




Between:


Windsor Essex
Community Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and
 
Sarah Wal


 
 
Tenant



 
 
 
Windsor Essex Community Housing
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict
Sarah Wal (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 20, 2022.
Only the Landlord's Legal
Representative, Cameron Parrott, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
November 1, 2020 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective March 12,
2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $716.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant paid $3,794.60 after the application was filed.
 
6.    
The parties agree that the amount
outstanding to January 31, 2022, inclusive of rent arrears
($533.40), and costs ($186.00), is $719.40.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’), including the impact of COVID-19 on the
parties and whether the Landlord
attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. The Landlord requested
relief from eviction subject to the conditions below.




 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $719.40,
which represents the arrears of rent
($533.40), and costs ($186.00) outstanding for the period ending January 31,
2022.
 
2.     The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant is denied
on the condition that:
 
(a)  
The Tenant shall make the following payments to the Landlord in respect of the
monies owing under paragraph 1 of this order:
 



Date Payment Due


Amount of Payment




March 1, 2022


$200.00
(costs and arrears)




April 1, 2022

May 1, 2022

(b)  
The Tenant shall also pay the
Landlord the rent for the months of February 2022 up to and including
June 2022 in full, on or before
the first day of each corresponding month.
 
3.    
If the Tenant fails to make any of the payments
in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates required, then:
 
(a)  
The Landlord may apply under
section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an
order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, and for the payment of
any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not already ordered under paragraph 1
of this order. The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a
breach of a condition set out in paragraph 2 of this order.
 
(b)  
The balance owing under paragraph 1 of this order
shall become payable on the day following the date of default.
The monies owing shall bear interest
at the post-judgment interest
rate determined under subsection 207(7) of the Act.
