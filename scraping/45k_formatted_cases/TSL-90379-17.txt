Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-90379-17
 










 
 

A.S.L
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict C.M
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes
(“the L1 application”).
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to pay compensation for
the damages caused by the Tenant or a person the Tenant permitted in the
residential complex (“the L2 application”).
 
These
applications were heard in Toronto on January 24, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord (who was self-represented) attended the hearing
with her witness, P.L (“PL”).  
 
The Tenant did not attend the hearing.  I had no record before me
of a request for an adjournment and I was satisfied that the Tenant received
proper notice of the time, place and location of the hearing.  
 
Nonetheless, I waited until after 10:00 a.m.  When the Tenant
still did not arrive, I proceeded to hear the Landlord’s applications.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 application
 
1.      The
Tenant remains in possession of the residential unit. 
 
2.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from July 1, 2017 to January 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective November 9, 2017.
 
3.      The
Landlord submitted a written summary at the hearing showing that, as of the
hearing date, the amount of arrears outstanding was $4,800.00.  The Tenant has
made no payments toward the arrears since the application was filed.
 
4.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $900.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 1, 2017 to
November 9, 2017.
 
6.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.  Based upon the uncontested evidence provided at
the hearing, I see no reason to delay or deny the Landlord’s request for
eviction.
L2 application
 
7.      The
Landlord testified that the Tenant – or someone permitted by the Tenant in the
residential complex, had wilfully or negligently damaged the doorbell to the
unit.  She outlined that when she confronted the Tenant about the damaged
doorbell, the Tenant did not admit that he or his guests had done the damage,
but the Tenant undertook to fix the doorbell himself.  The Landlord testified
that this led her to conclude that the Tenant or his guests had caused this
problem.  However, the Landlord added, the Tenant has not attended to the
doorbell repair/replacement to date (despite his promise to do so).
 
8.      PL
testified that he had received two estimates to replace the damaged doorbell:
one from Rona in the amount of $99.43 and a second from an electrician in the
amount of $82.48.
 
9.      Based
upon the uncontested evidence provided by the Landlord and PL, I find that the
Tenant and/or someone permitted by the Tenant in the residential complex damaged
the doorbell for the unit.   Under the circumstances, it seems reasonable to me
to require the Tenant to pay an amount to replace and/or repair the doorbell. 
Under the circumstances, I find the lesser of the two estimates put forward by
the Landlord to be more reasonable - $82.48.  As such, an order will be made
requiring the Tenant to pay to the Landlord this amount.
It is ordered that:
 
L1 application
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before February 6, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $3,738.74*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to January 26, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $29.59 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting January 27, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
February 6, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from February 7, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 6, 2018, then starting February 7,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 7,
2018.
 
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $4,990.00 if the payment is made on or before January 31, 2018, or
ii)       $5,890.00 if the payment is made on or before February 6, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 7, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
L2 application
 
10.   The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $82.48, which represents the reasonable cost
of repairing and/or replacing the damaged doorbell for the unit.
 
11.   If
the Tenant does not pay to the Landlord the full amount owing on or before
February 6, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from February 7, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
