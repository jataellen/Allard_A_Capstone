In the matter
of:


301, 31 LYONS STREET KINGSTON ON K7K0C9


 




Between:


Addiction &
Mental Health Services Kfla


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


David Jones


Tenant



 
 
Addiction & Mental Health
Services Kfla (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict David Jones (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant failed to meet a
condition specified in the mediated settlement issued by the Board on September
7, 2021 with respect to application HOL-09950-21.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on February 17, 2022 at 1:20pm. Only the Landlord
attended the hearing.
The Landlord was represented by Nicki Diak. Also in attendance was the
Landlord’s witness, Shauna Perezz.
Determinations:
 
1.     This application was filed pursuant
to section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'). Applications of this nature normally result in the Board issuing an
eviction order without a hearing. However,
this application was sent to a hearing because it was unclear with the Kingston Community Legal Clinic was
advised of the breach within 24 hours, pursuant to paragraph 7 of the mediated
agreement dated September 7, 2021.
 
L4 APPLICATION
2.    
The mediated settlement provided
that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain conditions specified in the
settlement.
 
3.     At the hearing,
the Landlord’s representative presented an e-mail
from the KCLC, dated
February 3, 2022 confirming that the KCLC was not retained to represent the
Tenant at the hearing on February 17, 2022 but acknowledged that the Landlord
had fulfilled its obligation under paragraph 7 of the agreement.

4.    
The Landlord’s witness, Shauna
Perezz, who is a Housing
Loss Prevention Worker
with the Landlord, testified
that she observed, on video
surveillance footage, the Tenant had permitted
Brandon MacDonald entry to the rental unit on October 18, 2021
and October 19, 2021; on
October 19, 2021, the Tenant also permitted Gage Teeple who caused damage to
the residential complex as the spray paint was found on walls and the back door
of the residential complex. Since then, there have been further incidents at
the premises. As such, the Landlord seeks a termination of the tenancy.
 
5.     Based on the uncontested evidence
before me, I find that the Tenant was in breach of the
mediated agreement dated September 7, 2021; specifically, the Tenant failed to
comply with paragraphs 2 and 14 by admitting
individuals on the no-trespass list to the residential
complex and by causing damage to the residential complex.
 
6.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Residential Tenancies Act, 2006) and find
that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act. The Landlord is unaware of any circumstances that would
justify relief from eviction.
 
7.     This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant
must move out of the rental
unit on or before March 11, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 11, 2022, then starting
March 12, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 12, 2022.
