Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-99239-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


D, 305
FIRST STREET W CORNWALL ON K6H1C6


 




Between:


Yves
  Menard


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Larry Terriah William Giroux


Tenants



 
 
 
Yves Menard (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Larry
Terriah and William Giroux (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the
Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants
failed to meet a
condition specified in the order issued
by the Board on July 6, 2021 with respect to application
EAL-93153-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants have not met the following
condition specified in the order: The Tenants did not pay $234.00 arrears
on or before January 1, 2022. The Tenants did not pay $784.00 rent on or before
January 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $2,808.00 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order EAL-93153-20. The amount that is still owing from that
order is $1,313.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order EAL-93153-20 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became owing.




File Number: EAL-99239-22
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order EAL-93153-20 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 13, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$1,416.10*.( Less any amount paid since the date
The application was filed on January 18, 2022.) This amount represents the rent owing up to February 2, 2022 and
the costs related to the application fee for the previous application.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$25.78 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 3, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
13, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 14, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 13, 2022, then starting
February 14, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 14, 2022.

The tenant has until February 12, 2022
to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by February 12, 2022 the order will be stayed and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of
