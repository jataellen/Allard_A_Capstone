Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-02343-18
 










 
 
 

PPL
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict LM
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on March 22, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s Representative, SK attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to
pay for the period from February 1, 2018 to March 31, 2018.  Because of the
arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective February 20,
2018.
2.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,368.34 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period
from January 1, 2018 to February 20, 2018.
4.     
The Tenant paid $400.00 after the application was filed.
5.     
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance
with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of
the rental unit on or before April 7, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $302.60*, which represents
the amount of rent owing and compensation up to March 27, 2018, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $44.99 per day for
compensation for the use of the unit starting March 28, 2018 to the date the
Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of
filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on
or before April 7, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be
simple interest calculated from April 8, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated on or before April 7, 2018, then
starting April 8, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
April 8, 2018.
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy,
the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $2,126.68 if the payment is made on or before March 31, 2018, or
ii)       $3,495.02 if the payment is made on or before April 7, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that
subsection on or after April 8, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant
possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
