Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44703-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


B, 354 DEWE AVENUE THUNDER BAY ON P7A2G4


 




Between:


1648821 Ontario Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kathy Dacosta
  Ron Okerland


Tenants



 
 
 
1648821 Ontario Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ron Okerland and Kathy Dacosta (the
'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because
the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the
Board on October 14, 2021 with respect to application NOL-43577-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants
have not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenants failed to pay $510.00
towards the arrears, on or before January 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears
of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $4,080.00 for rent arrears
in Order NOL-43577-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $3,060.00 and
that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order NOL-43577-21
is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.
 
6.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $990.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.




 
 
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from October
16, 2020 to February 8, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order NOL-43577-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 19, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$3,319.41*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to February 8, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $32.55
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 9, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
19, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 20, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 19, 2022, then starting
February 20, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after February 20, 2022.

The tenant has until February 18, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by February 18, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on August 20, 2022 if the order has not been filed on
or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
