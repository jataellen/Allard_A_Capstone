In the matter
of:


1675 ST JOHNS SIDEROAD AURORA ON L4G7C7


 




Between:


Weslie Creek

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Shannon Mcmahon


Tenant



 
 
 
Weslie Creek Developments Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Shannon Mcmahon (the 'Tenant')
because the Landlord intends to demolish the rental unit.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 20, 2022
at 9:22 AM. The Landlord’s agent, Matthew Gabriele, and the Tenant
attended the hearing. Determinations:
1.     The Landlord’s application is based on an N13 notice
of termination served on the Tenants on September 17, 2021 with a termination
date of January 31, 2022, claiming that the Landlord
intends to demolish
the rental unit or the residential complex.
The N13 details the work as,
“The home will be demolished to allow for the site works, including earth work
and servicing to accommodate an industrial building.”
 
2.    
I find that the Landlord requires
the rental unit to be vacated in order to demolish it. The Landlord submitted demolition permit
No. PR20211184 issued
on September 10, 2021 by the Town of Aurora necessary to
complete this work. The Tenant did
not challenge the Landlord’s good faith intention to complete the work
described in the N13 notice of termination.
 
3.     The residential complex comprises one rental unit. In accordance with section 52(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”), the Landlord is required to provide the
Tenant with compensation equal to one month’s rent for such a notice of
termination, prior to the termination
date contained in the notice of termination.
The Landlord has indicated an intention to waive a month’s rent,
although the Landlord and Tenant are not in agreement as to whether the Tenant
is or is not in arrears of rent, and therefore whether compensation had been effected. The Landlord confirmed at the hearing
that his actions amount to an
irrevocable addition of an amount equal to one month’s rent to the
Tenant’s rent roll. As the hearing
took place prior to
the termination date in the notice of

hearing, I accept that the Landlord
has irrevocably so credited the rent roll,
and that this order, together with the hearing
record, constitutes evidence of that credit.
 
4.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of
the Act, and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until April 30, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b)
of the Act. The Tenant asked for additional time until the end of April, which was agreeable to
the Landlord. The Tenant had asked
for cooperation of the Landlord in removing barriers
that are inhibiting her move-out. While I
have no jurisdiction on an L2 application to compel such cooperation by the
Landlord, I note the Landlord’s stated intention to cooperate, and encourage
the parties to work to this end.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated, as of April 30, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the
rental unit on or before April 30, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
April 30, 2022, then starting
May 1, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after May 1, 2022.

81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
