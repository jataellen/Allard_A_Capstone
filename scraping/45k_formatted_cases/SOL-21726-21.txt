Order under
Section 100
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number: SOL-21726-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
BSMT, 2063
SAXON ROAD OAKVILLE ON
  L6L2V1


 




Between:


Yi Shen


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Courtney Clements


Tenant



 
 
Yi Shen (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy of Courtney Clements
(the 'Tenant'), and for compensation for the use of the rental unit.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on September
22, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord attended the
hearing. As of 12:06 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing,
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant transferred the occupancy of the rental
unit to C. Clements
(hereinafter called the
'Unauthorized Occupant') in a manner that was not authorized by the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). The Landlord
did not enter
into a tenancy agreement with this person.
 
2.     The Unauthorized Occupant
was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The Landlord is entitled to compensation for the
use and occupation of the rental
unit by the Unauthorized
Occupant.
 
4.    
The total monthly rent amount the Tenant was paying before
the rental unit was
transferred improperly to the Unauthorized Occupant was $2,473.33.
 
5.     The Landlord submitted that he tried to attend the
unit to speak with the Unauthorized Occupant,
but he refuses to open the door. The Landlord
submitted that even when he meets the Unauthorized Occupant in the
hallway, he refuses to talk to him.
 
6.    
The Landlord stated that the Unauthorized Occupant shut down the water in the residential complex and it was with the
help of police officers that the
water was reinstated.




File Number: SOL-21726-21
 
7.    
The Landlord stated that he had no
information about the Unauthorized Occupant and that he never authorized any
transfer of lease to the Unauthorized Occupant. The Landlord submitted
that he obtained the name “C. Clements”
from the police
officer who attended the
rental unit.
 
8.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would
be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the
Act. Based on the uncontested evidence provided by the Landlord at the hearing,
I find that the Unauthorized Occupant took over the rental unit improperly and
started occupying the unit without permission from the Landlord. I have no reason to deny the eviction order requested by the Landlord.
 
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated as of February 22, 2022.
 
2.    
The Unauthorized Occupant shall move out of the rental unit on or before March 5, 2022.
 
3.     The Unauthorized Occupant
shall pay to the Landlord
$29,679.96, which represents compensation for the use of
the unit from March 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022.
 
4.     The Unauthorized Occupant shall also pay to the
Landlord $81.31 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from
March 1, 2022 to the date they move out of the unit.
 
5.     The Unauthorized Occupant
shall also pay the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.     The Unauthorized Occupant
shall pay the Landlord the full amount
owing by March 5, 2022.
 
7.     If the Unauthorized Occupant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing by March 5, 2022 (he/she/they) will owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from March 6, 2022
at 2.00% on the outstanding balance.
 
8.     If the unit is not vacated by March
5, 2022, then starting
March 6, 2022, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (the Sheriff), so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord after March 6, 2022.
