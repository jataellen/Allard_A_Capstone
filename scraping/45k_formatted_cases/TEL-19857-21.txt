Metcap Living Management Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Colmar Worrell and Mara Worrell

This application was heard by
way of video conference on January 19, 2022. Only the Landlord’s legal representative Tricia
Radam attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:

31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 26, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,649.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.

is owing to the Tenants
for the period from May 28, 2020 to
September 26, 2021.
 
4.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on November
30, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated November 30, 2021,
the day possession was returned to the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $3,282.02*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to November
30, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
