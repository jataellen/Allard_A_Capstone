Review Order
 
Fredrick Sprenger (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Crystal Peters and Oshane Henry (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was resolved by order CEL-01520-21 issued on November
2, 2021. On November 5, 2021,
the Landlord requested a review of the order.
The request was heard by videoconference on January 19, 2022.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant
CP attended the hearing. CP was assisted by Tenant Duty Counsel
before the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Review
 
1.     The Landlord’s request
for a review is based on the ground of serious error.
 
2.     In the order under review, the Member found that the N4
notice was invalid for having the wrong issuance date on it.
There is no requirement in the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’) that a notice of termination be dated (although I note that the Board
form has a place for a date beside the signature, which is
mandatory). At the hearing
that gave rise to the order under
review, the Landlord had testified that he had put the wrong date on the form beside
his signature because
he had pre-dated it. There was no question that the
Landlord had served
the N4 notice at least 14 days before the termination date on the notice, as required by the Act.




 
3.     I find that it was a serious
error to find the N4 notice to be invalid
for this reason.
This was a minor clerical
error that should not have affected the validity of the notice.
 
4.     Based on the above, at the hearing
I granted the Landlord’s request
for a review and I heard the L1 application de novo.
 
L1 application
 
Section 82 issues
 
5.    
Seven days before the hearing the
Tenant CP served on the Landlord and filed with the Board a form indicating that she wished to raise a number of issues
under s.82 of the Act.
 
6.     The form raises eight allegations, three of which are
defences or responses to the L1 application
and so are not issues
to be considered under s.82 of the Act. The issue as to
a rent deposit paid in March 2020 predates the tenancy.
 
7.    
The remaining issues are described
in a way that does not give the Landlord enough details to know how to respond
to them. CP sent a second email four days before the hearing with 37 attachments, six of which give details
in the form of a narrative about one
of the allegations in the s.82 form (about maintenance issues). This email and
the attachments do not clearly set out the relevant details, and they were
accompanied by nearly 30 other attachments. This email was too confusing to be
considered adequate disclosure. Further, it was sent to the Landlord and filed
with the Board four days before the hearing. Rule 19.4 of the Board’s Rules of
Procedure provides that a tenant who wishes to raise s.82 issues at a hearing
must serve the landlord and file
with the Board a list of their
issues as well as their supporting evidence at least seven days before the
hearing. The form itself states this as well. Rule 19.5 provides that a tenant
who fails to comply with s.19.4 shall not be permitted to raise these issues at
the hearing unless the Board is satisfied that they could not comply. CP gave
no evidence that she could not comply with this requirement.
 
8.    
For the reasons above,
I did not hear any evidence or submissions with respect to the
issues raised on the Tenants’ s.82 form.
 
Arrears
 
9.    
The tenancy has an interesting
background, in that CP moved into the unit during other tenants’ tenancy,
making her an occupant at that point.
When those tenants
left, CP and the
Landlord entered into a new lease including CP and five other people as Tenants on the lease. The lease is an agreement
for the rental of the whole rental unit, which is a house, for $2,250.00 per
month.
 
10.  The N4 notice served by the Landlord states that the
monthly rent was $850.00 for the month of June, 2021 whereas
it was $2,250.00 for each of the months of July 2021 and
November 2020. The lease, which starts October 1, 2020, states that the rent is
$2,250.00 per month. The N4
incorrectly states the amount of rent due for June 2021. Section 59 of the Act provides
that an N4 notice must correctly state the amount
owed. In




 
order to do that clearly, an N4
notice must also correctly state what the rent is and what was paid. In this
case the N4 notice is confusing because it indicates a very different monthly rent for one of
the rental periods
which, I note, is in between
the two other rental
periods, suggesting that the rent was drastically reduced for one month then
was increased again to its original amount. There was no reason given for this
discrepancy other than it was an error. For this reason I found at the hearing
that the N4 notice was invalid.
 
11.  The Landlord requested
that the L1 application be amended to request arrears
only. The Tenants are not
prejudiced by this request and so I granted it. The application is amended
accordingly.
 
12.  The Landlord filed a ledger showing that the Tenants
owe $16,090.00 in arrears to January 31, 2022. CP disputed that she owes this
amount because the parties had agreed that CP would be reimbursed for the cost
of some expenses she incurred on the Landlord’s behalf in November 2020. The
Landlord conceded that CP was entitled to this reimbursement, in the amount
of $340.00, that as a result the Tenants’ rent for November 2020 should be indicated to be
paid in full, and that the arrears should be reduced to reflect this.
 
13.  CP gave no other evidence
or submissions that would call into question
the amount owed as claimed by the Landlord. CP
testified that the Landlord had refused to accept payments from CP
at one point because CP was asserting
that her rent was $850.00 and
not the full amount (at least four of the other Tenants vacated the unit in
June 2021 and CP thought she only owed her portion).
The Landlord denied refusing to
accept payment. CP acknowledged that
after the Landlord allegedly told her that he would not accept rent payments she made no attempts to pay the rent at all. These circumstances do not affect
the Tenants’ obligation to pay the rent in full. At best they may explain why
arrears accrued but these circumstances do not affect the amount owed.
 
14.  Based on the Landlord’s ledger, as adjusted, and the
Tenants’ lack of evidence to establish that any different amount
is owed, I find, on a balance
of probabilities, that the
arrears owed to January 31, 2022 are $15,750.00. The Tenants also owe the Landlord
the cost of the application fee, which is $186.00. The total owed by the
Tenants is
$15,936.00.
 
15.  The Tenants cannot pay the full amount in a lump sum.
However, because eviction cannot be a consequence of failure to pay, it is not appropriate to order a payment plan. The Tenants will be given until
March 31, 2022 to pay the amount owed, after which interest will accrue.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s request
for a review of order CEL-01520-21 is granted.
 
2.     Order CEL-01520-21 issued
on November 2, 2021 is cancelled
and replaced by the
following:




 
 
 
3.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $15,936.00, which represents the amount of rent
owing up to January 31, 2022, plus the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before March 31, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from April 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
