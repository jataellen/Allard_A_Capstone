Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19545-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


C, 95 SPRING
STREET TRENTON ON K8V3Y9


 




Between:


Daniel Smith


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Aaron Montgomery


Tenant



 
 
 
Daniel Smith (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Maria Taslis
and Aaron Montgomery (the 'Tenants') because they, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have wilfully
or negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also
applied for an order requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the
damage.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on January 11, 2022.
The Landlord and Maria Taslis,
on behalf of the Tenant
attended the hearing. Maria Taslis spoke with Duty
Counsel prior to the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    For the reasons
that follow, the Landlord’s application is dismissed without
prejudice.
 
2.   
The Landlord’s application is based on a notice of termination (‘Notice’) under section 62 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') claiming the Tenants, an
occupant of the Tenants' rental unit or a
person permitted in the residential complex by the Tenants wilfully or
negligently causes undue damage to the rental unit or the residential complex.
 
3.    The Notice names Aaron Montgomery (AM) and Maria Taslis
(MS) as the Tenants.
 
4.   
MS raised
as a preliminary issue that she is not a Tenant; she is the Tenant, AM’s mother.
She testified that AM gives her the rent money and she e-transfers it to the
Landlord because her son does not have e-transfer. She has not acted in the
capacity of a Tenant and has only spoken to or tested the Landlord a few times
on behalf of the Tenant when he has not had a phone available.
 
5.   
The Landlord
testified that AM is the only one named as a Tenant
on the lease, he added MS because she pays the rent for
the Tenant, but he understands she is not a Tenant.

6.   
Based on the undisputed
testimony before me I find that Maria Taslis is not a Tenant. Therefore, as the N5 notice of eviction improperly names her as a Tenant,
the notice is fatally flawed, and the application
cannot proceed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord's application is dismissed.
