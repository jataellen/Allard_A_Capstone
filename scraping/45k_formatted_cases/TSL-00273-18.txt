Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-00273-18










 

F.M
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict EM
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. (L1
application)
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the
Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage; because the
Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in
the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another
tenant; and because the number of persons living in the unit on a continuing
basis is more than permitted by health, safety or housing standards. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit
after the termination date. (L2 application)
 
This
combined application was heard in Toronto on November 9, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord attended
the hearing. The Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing as it appears from the Certificate
of Service filed by the Landlord. 
 
The matter was scheduled to be heard at 9:30 AM. I waited until
10:55 AM and proceeded with the hearing without the Tenant in attendance.
 
Determinations:
 
  L1 Application
 
1.      Based
on the uncontested evidence of the Landlord, I am satisfied, on a balance of
probabilities, as to the following.
2.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from September 1, 2018 to November 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 17, 2018.
3.     
The Tenant is in possession of
the rental unit. 
4.      The monthly rent as of the date of the hearing is $700.00.
5.      The
Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
Section
83
6.      The
Tenant was not present at the hearing and provided no evidence of any section
83 considerations for me to consider. 
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
L2
Application
8.      The
N5 notice of termination dated September 15, 2018 and filed in support of this
application alleged that on August 15, 2018, the Tenant had up to 8 friends
living in and occupying the empty bedrooms, overcrowding, stealing other
tenants’ belongings, creating a mess, together with the presence of weapons
heard of, and the presence of a vicious dog that bit people.
9.      Additionally,
the N5 also alleged that on September 2, 2018, the Tenant had three other
friends living at the house, when he only has tenancy for one bedroom.  These
friends were overcrowding, squatting and using drugs, and further that, on
September 14, 2018, the tenant’s friends moved into an empty bedroom in the
house without paying for it, and there were reports of stealing, partying and fighting.
10.   At
the hearing, the Landlord did not have any witness, witness statements or
affidavits, photographs, records of complaints, police reports or any reliable
evidence to support the allegations in the N5.  It is also the Landlord’s
evidence that he does not reside at the residential complex.
11.   Notwithstanding
that the Tenant was not present to challenge the Landlord’s evidence, I am not
satisfied that the Landlord has met his onus of proving his allegations in the
N5 Notice on a balance of probabilities.  
12.   The
Landlord also claimed that the N5 was not voided in the voiding period because
he had attended the residential complex on August 15, 2018, between 9:00 AM and
1:00 PM to do household cleaning and observed the same behaviour.
13.   However,
the Certificate of Service indicates that the N5 was served on September 15,
2018, and the voiding period would be the 7 days following that service.  The
Landlord’s presence at the residential house on August 15, 2018 is not evidence
that the N5 Notice was not voided.
14.   I
therefore do not find there is sufficient evidence that the N5 was not voided.
15.   As
a result, the Landlord’s L2 application shall be dismissed.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Due
to the Canada Post strike, the Landlord, upon receipt of this order must give a
copy of this order to the Tenant by a method set out in subsection 191(1) of
the Act, other than by sending it by mail or courier to the last known address
where the Tenant resides or carries on business.
2.      The
L2 application is dismissed.
3.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before November 30, 2018.
4.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,840.86*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to November 19, 2018.
5.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $23.01 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting November 20, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
6.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
7.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
November 30, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from December 1, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
8.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before November 30, 2018, then starting December
1, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after December 1,
2018.
10.   If,
on or before November 30, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $2,290.00** to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. 
This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain
in the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
11.   The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after December 1, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
