In the matter of:      6, 23 HARMONY
ROAD S
OSHAWA ON L1H6T3
 
Between:                  Harmony Gardens Ltd                                    Landlord
 
 
and
 




Jennifer Roadhouse Scott Cormier


Tenants




 
 
Harmony Gardens Ltd (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jennifer Roadhouse
and Scott Cormier
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 27, 2021. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Joey Kay, attended
the hearing. As of 1:45 p.m.,
the Tenants were not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from December 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective January 26, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent for the unit increased to $1,774.07.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,731.59 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from July 1, 2020 to January 26, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenants paid $19,918.14 after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 13, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $530.25*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
2, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $57.63 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 3, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
13, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 14, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 13, 2022, then starting
February 14, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 14, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before February 13,
2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $4,096.60** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 14, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
