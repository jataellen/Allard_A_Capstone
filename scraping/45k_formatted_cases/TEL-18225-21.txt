Zamir Khan (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Tristin Trulsen (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on January 5, 2022. Only the Landlord attended the

although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.

1.    The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
June 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 18,
2021.
 
2.    The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
August 31, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.

monthly rent was
$1,800.00.
 
4.   
The Landlord
is not holding a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.   
The Tenant
has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Tenancy
is terminated as of
August 31, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,469.13*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to
August 31, 2021.

for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.     
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 27, 2022, the Tenant

calculated from January 28, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
