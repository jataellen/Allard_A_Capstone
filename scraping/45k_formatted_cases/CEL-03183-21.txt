In the
  matter of:


43 DRAKE BOULEVARD BRAMPTON ON L6T3L1


 




Between:


Meenal Patel Rajeshkumar Patel


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Ghazala Najam Najam Hasan Shahzob Hasan


Tenants



 
 
Meenal Patel and Rajeshkumar
Patel (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Shahzob
Hasan, Ghazala Najam and Najam Hasan (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent
that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 24, 2022. Only the Landlords’ Legal Representative, Shalini
Puri, attended the hearing. As of 3:27 p.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from May 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of
Termination effective September 15, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on November
5, 2021. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $2,000.00.
 
4.    
The Tenants have made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $2,000.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from September 1, 2018 to September 15, 2021.




File Number: CEL-03183-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of November
5, 2021, the date the Tenants returned
vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlords.
 
2.

owing and compensation up to November 5, 2021, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlords
the full amount owing* on or before
February 19, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 20, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
