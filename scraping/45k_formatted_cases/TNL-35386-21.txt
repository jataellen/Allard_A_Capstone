In the
  matter of:


221, 117 WHITBURN CRESCENT TORONTO ON M3M2S7


 




Between:


117 Whitburn Holdings Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Nioka Antonio Thompson


Tenant



 
 
117 Whitburn Holdings Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Nioka Antonio Thompson (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 10, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Alethia Hall, attended the hearing. As of 11:15 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from October 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective October 21, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,073.60.
 
4.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,073.60 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from January 1, 2021 to
October 21, 2021.
 
6.    
The Tenant paid $4,440.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find
that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until March 31, 2022 pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.

It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 31, 2022.
 
2.    
As of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the
Landlord is entitled to by $575.64*.
 
3.     However, the Landlord
is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount the
Landlord owes the Tenant:
$35.30 per
day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February
19, 2022 to the
date the Tenant moves out of the unit, and
$186.00 for
the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
The Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the other
any sum of money that is owed as a
result of this order.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before March 31, 2022, then starting April 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 1, 2022.
 
7.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)          
$1,075.58 if the payment is made on or before February 28, 2022, or
ii)         
$2,149.18 if the payment is made on or before
March 31, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if the Tenant pays the
amount required under that
subsection on or after April 1, 2022 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession
to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
