Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26093-21-EX
 
In the matter
of:      1337 MONTCLAIR DRIVE
OAKVILLE ON L6H1Z3
 
Between:                  Nimmi Khurana                                    Landlord
 
and
 
Maya Naji                                                                                                                     Tenant
 
On November 8,
2021, Nimmi Khurana (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Maya Naji (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the
Tenant owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued
by the Board on April 27,
2021 with respect to application SOL-17384-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain
condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.     
I find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed to pay to the Landlord
$700.00 on or before November
4, 2021 towards arrears of
rent.
 
3.     
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $5,674.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's
application fee in Order SOL-17384-20. The amount that is still owing from that order is $1,400.00
and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous
order SOL-17384-20 is cancelled.
 
5.     
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,800.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 28, 2015 to January 4, 2022.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order SOL-17384-20 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 15, 2022.
 
3.     
As of the date of this
order, the Tenant owes no money to the Landlord because the amount of the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the amount
of rent owing up to November 30, 2021, that the Landlord
is entitled to under this order by $569.42.
 
4.     
The Landlord
is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenant:
$63.52 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting December 1,
2021 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     
The Landlord
or the Tenant shall pay any amounts
that become owing as a result of this
order.
 
6.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
15, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
7.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 16, 2022.

The tenant has until January 14, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files
the motion by January 14, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on July 16, 2022 if
the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
