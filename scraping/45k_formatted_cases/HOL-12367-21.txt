Stephen Wai Fat Lau (the

Michshyan Newton (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that
the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed administration charges related to
NSF cheques.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 1, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal
Representative, Hoi Fai Alvin Chan, attended the hearing. As of 3:13

required to pay for the period
from July 23, 2021 to January
23, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective October
11, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on January
23, 2022. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
3.    
The lawful monthly rent was $1,850.00.
4.    
The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed.
5.    
The Landlord incurred charges
of $140.00 for administration charges
related to 7 cheques tendered by or on behalf of the
Tenant, which were returned NSF.
 
6.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,850.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period from December
24, 2020 to October 11, 2021.
