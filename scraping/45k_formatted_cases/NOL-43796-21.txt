Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-43796-21
 



In the matter
of:


UNIT 4, 702
BARRYDOWNE ROAD SUDBURY ON
  P3A3T5


 




Between:


John Shane


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Barry
Robinson Peter Beaulne


Tenants



 
 
 
John Shane (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Barry Robinson
and Peter Beaulne (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 16, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Monique
Laderoute, attended the hearing.
As of 10:27 a.m. the Tenants
were not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from August
1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
August 20, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,450.00.
4.     The Tenants paid $3,625.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord’s attempts at negotiating a repayment agreement
were unsuccessful.
 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,450.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until January 28, 2022 pursuant to subsection
83(1)(b) of the Act. Additional time given
to the Tenants to either
secure alternative accommodation or pay the outstanding amount.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated. The
Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before January 28, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $1,784.55*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 6, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $47.67 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 7, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 28, 2022, the
Tenants will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January 29, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
January 29, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 28, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $4,541.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenants
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or
after January 29, 2022 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant
possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
