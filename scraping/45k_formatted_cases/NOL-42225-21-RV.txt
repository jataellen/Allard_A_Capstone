Review Order
 
Cemcor Apts Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Mike Thomson (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved by order NOL-42225-21 issued on July 22, 2021. On July 22, 2021, the Landlord
requested a review of the order.
The request was heard via video
conference on October 29, 2021.
 
Jason Ceming (JC), on behalf of the corporate
Landlord, and the Landlord’s legal
representative, Al Dharsee attended the hearing.
 
The Landlord
called as a witness, George
Hawrelluk (GH), the superintendent.
At 2:07 p.m. the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing.
Determinations:
 
Review:
 
1.    
The issued to be determined by the Board in the review hearing
is whether the Landlord
was not reasonably able to participate at the hearing on July 15, 2021.
 
2.     JC testified that he did not receive
the Notice of Hearing for July 15, 2021. He became
aware of the hearing when he received the order from the Board.
 
3.    
The Landlord’s representative also stated that he did not receive
the Notice of
Hearing.




 
4.    
The Board’s file indicates
that the Notice of Hearing
was not sent to the Landlord’s legal representative.
 
5.    
I
find that on a balance
of probabilities that the Landlord
was not able to participate at the hearing. I
have no reason to doubt the Landlord’s assertion that they did not receive the
notice of hearing.
 
6.     The Landlord’s request
for review was granted and I heard
the Landlord’s application de novo (anew).
 
L1 – Arrears of Rent and Eviction:
 
1.   
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
December 1, 2020 to October 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective February
12, 2021.
 
2.   
The Tenant is in possession of the unit.
 
3.   
The monthly rent is $1,000.00.
 
4.   
The Tenant made no payments after the application was filed.
 
5.   
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,000.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.   
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 1, 2020
to February 12, 2021.
 
7.   
The Landlord’s superintendent, GH,
testified that on or about October 14, 2021, he reached out to the Tenant to try and resolve the matter by a payment
plan. The Tenant indicated that he would sign the
payment plan, but never did so.
 
8.   
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order NOL-42225-21 issued
on July 22, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the following: Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated. The Tenant must move out
of the rental unit on or before February 22, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $12,562.39*, which represents the amount
of rent owing and compensation up to February
11, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.




 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$32.88 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 12, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 22, 2022, then starting
February 23, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 23, 2022.
 
7.     If, on or before February 22, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $14,386.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 23, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period
of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
