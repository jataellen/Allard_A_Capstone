AMENDED ORDER
 
THIS ORDER AMENDS
A CLERICAL ERROR
IN THE JANUARY 13, 2022 INTERIM REVIEW ORDER
 
TS (the 'Tenant') applied for an
order determining that AB (the 'Landlord') or
the Landlord’s superintendent the Landlord’s agent,
harassed, obstructed, coerced,
threatened or interfered with the Tenant, substantially interfered with
the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenant or by a member
of the Tenant's household and withheld
or deliberately interfered with the reasonable supply of a vital service, care
service, or food that the Landlord is obligated to supply under the tenancy
agreement.
 
This application was resolved by order SWT-41643-20 issued on May 7, 2020. On June 1, 2020, the Tenant
requested a review of the order.
The Tenant also applied for an order to determine whether
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act') applies; to determine that the Landlord failed to meet the
Landlord's maintenance obligations under the Act or failed to comply with
health, safety, housing or maintenance standards; and to determine that the
Landlord gave a notice of termination in bad faith.
 
The Landlord applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Landlord’s child requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
The Tenant’s review request
and the applications were heard on May 21, 2021 and November 23, 2021.
 
The Tenant, the Tenant’s
representative, J. K, the Landlord and the Landlord’s representative, J.S,
attended the hearing on May 21, 2021. The
Landlord’s witness (child), (‘SB’), also attended the hearing on May 21, 2021. Only the Landlord
and the

Landlord’s representative
attended the hearing on November 24, 2021 when the matters were called at 9:16AM. Neither
the Tenant nor the Tenant’s
representative attended the proceedings
for the remainder of the hearing block.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     At the May 21, 2021 hearing, the Tenant withdrew
application file number
SWT-42456-20 to determine whether the Act applies.
 
2.     Because limitation
periods under the Act were suspended for the period March
16, 2020 to September 14, 2020, the Board maintains jurisdiction over the Tenant’s T6 application
for the period beginning July 18, 2019.
 
3.    
The Landlord did not pay the Tenant compensation under section 48.1 of the Act to
terminate the tenancy for the Landlord’s own use. The Board therefore
lacks jurisdiction pursuant
to subsection 83(4) of the Act to grant the Landlord’s application.
 
4.     Because the Tenant did not attend the hearing to support their request to review the May 7, 2020 Board
Order, or their
other applications, I find that the Tenant
has abandoned the request and the applications.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The request to review
order SWT-41643-20, issued
on May 7, 2020, is denied.
The order is confirmed and
remains unchanged.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s application to terminate the tenancy for the Landlord’s child’s own use is
dismissed.
 
3.    
The Tenant’s applications are dismissed.
