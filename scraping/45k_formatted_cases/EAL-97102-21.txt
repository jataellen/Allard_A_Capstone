Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-97102-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


2, 153
DESCHAMPS STREET VANIER ON
  K1L5Z5


 




Between:


Pierre Paquette


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Krista
Barratt


Tenant



 
 
 
Pierre Paquette
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Krista
Barratt (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
The hearing
was held by video
conference on November 17, 2021.
 
At 12:07
pm, the Tenant and the Tenant’s Representative David Danielson attended
the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
Since the Landlord did not appear
at the hearing to support
their application, I find that this application has been abandoned.
 
2.    
The Tenant’s
Representative seeks $200.00 in costs against the Landlord because the Landlord
failed to show up at the hearing. The
Tenants Representative also claimed abuse of
process by the Landlord based on 2 previous matters brought before the board in May and August of 2021. EAL-92453-20 and EAL-95791-21 pertained to N12 notices served on the Tenant, one
dismissed as the Landlord failed to pay compensation to the Tenant. The Landlord withdrew the other matter as
no affidavit was provided.
 
3.    
Board Interpretation
Guideline #3 on Costs provides that the Board may award costs where a party has conducted themselves unreasonably. Although the Guideline is not
binding on me, I see no reason in these circumstances not to follow it.
 
4.    
Given the details in paragraph 2, I find an order for costs
against the Landlord
is warranted.
 
5.     The Board’s Rules of Practice
state:




File Number: EAL-97102-21
 
23.2  
A member may exercise
discretion to order a
party to pay another party's:
 
a. 
representation/preparation fees; and
 
b. 
other out-of-pocket expenses.
 
Where the LTB orders
a party to pay the representation/preparation fees incurred by another party, these fees shall not
exceed $100 per hour for the services of a paid representative to a maximum of
$700.
 
23.3  
A party who engages
in unreasonable conduct
which causes undue
delay or expense may be
ordered to pay costs to another party.
 
6.    
Accordingly, I find the Tenant Representative’s request for costs in the amount
of
$200.00 to be appropriate. An order shall
issue accordingly.
 
7.    
This order
contains all of the reasons
for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
 
2.     The Landlord shall pay to the Tenant’s
Representative costs in the amount of
$200.00.
 
3.    
If the Landlord does
not pay the Tenant’s Representative the full amount owing on or before February
1, 2022, the Landlord will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 2, 2022 at 2.00% annually
on the balance outstanding.
