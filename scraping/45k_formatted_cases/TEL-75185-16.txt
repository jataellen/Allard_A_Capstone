Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-75185-16
 










 
 

B.L.H.I..
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict K.H.
and J.H. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe. The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges and related
administration charges.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on January 11, 2017.
 
The Landlord’s representative, S.A-A., and the second-named Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from February 1, 2016 to January 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective November 7, 2016.
2.     The
Landlord incurred charges of $15.00 for cheques tendered by or on behalf of the
Tenants, which were returned NSF and $60.00 for related administration charges.
3.     The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,024.13 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
4.     Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2017
to November 7, 2016.
5.     The
Tenants paid $1,623.74 after the application was filed.
6.     At
the hearing, the Tenant requested a repayment plan that would end February 27,
2017.  The Landlord did not consent to this repayment plan because a previous
repayment plan had been agreed to and the Tenants did not adhere to the plan. 
The second-named Tenant admitted they did breach the side agreement prior to
the hearing and stated she had no excuse for the breach other than paying other
bills instead.  
7.     The
second-named Tenant stated her father, the other lessee, is ill and she takes
care of him.  She further testified she has returned to regular work and can
afford to pay the rent.
8.     A
repayment plan is not a reasonable solution based on the Tenants’
prioritization of bills and the breached promise prior to this hearing. 
However, based on the first-named Tenant’s illness and the second-named
Tenant’s increased work hours, it is not unreasonable to grant an extension of
time to pay the arrears.
9.     I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 10,
2017, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless
the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before February 10, 2017.
2.     The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $1,627.26*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to January 16, 2017 and the total charges
related to NSF cheques tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenants,
less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $34.86 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting January 17, 2017 to the date they move out of the
unit.
4.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $170.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.     If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February
10, 2017, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from February 11, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 10, 2017, then starting February
11, 2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 11,
2017.
8.     If
the Tenants wish to void this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)     $3,315.36
if the payment is made on or before January 31, 2017, or
ii)    $4,375.63
if the payment is made on or before February 10, 2017**.
If the
Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after February 11, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to
the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
