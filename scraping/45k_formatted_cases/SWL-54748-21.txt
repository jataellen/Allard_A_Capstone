Tenant



 
 
CRM Properties Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order requiring Maria Fatima Medeiros
(the 'Tenant') to pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on December 20, 2021. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Michelle
O’Neill, attended the hearing. As of 2:35 p.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant did not pay the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to October 31,
2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on
September 10, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the
date the application was filed.
 
3.    
There was no
documentation provided indicating that the Tenant had given a notice to
terminate the tenancy, or that there was an agreement to terminate in place. As such, the Tenant remains responsible for the
rental unit until it is re-rented.
 
4.    
The lawful
monthly rent was $999.68.
 
5.     The Tenant has made
no payments since the application was filed.
 
6.    
The Tenant paid
a last month’s rent deposit
of $925.00, at the onset of the tenancy. The Landlord owes $53.65 in interest on that deposit.
As a result, the amount
of $978.65 will be applied against any amount determined to be
outstanding.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,020.71, which represents the amount of rent
owing up to October 31, 2021 less the last month’s rent deposit and interest.




File Number: SWL-54748-21
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before January
18, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 19, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
