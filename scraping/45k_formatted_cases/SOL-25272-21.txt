Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-25272-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


UPPER, 1 VERNE
AVENUE WELLAND ON L3C1Z6


 




Between:


Carol Jones


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Shirley Walker


Tenant



 
 
 
Carol Jones (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Shirley
Walker (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or
negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage.
 
This application was heard at
3pm via videoconference on January
19, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord attended the
hearing however the Tenant had signed in earlier in the day but was not present when the hearing
proceeded. The Landlord
indicated the Tenant
left the hearing around 2:00 p.m. without an
explanation given.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant vacated the rental unit and the Landlord’s application for eviction is moot.
 
2.     The application for damage under
section 89 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') was considered.
 
3.     The Landlord testified the drain bucket of the
Tenant’s portable air conditioning unit overflowed and leaked through
the floor in the unit and into the ceiling
and walls of the
below unit causing undue damage.
 
4.     There were no photographs of the damage caused to the rental
unit or the unit below
provided. The Landlord’s testimony did not provide enough detail to understand
the scope and extent of the damage caused to the floor, ceiling and walls.
 
5.     The Landlord also submitted a quote from a restoration contractor which she stated was obsolete. She did not provide
receipts, quote, costs or a breakdown of the material and labour that was
incurred or expected to be incurred to repair the damage.




File Number: SOL-25272-21
 
6.    
Although the Landlord states she’d
be happy to receive $1,200.00 for the damage caused, the Landlord failed
to present enough
evidence to meet the burden of proof
required to support her claim.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1. The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
