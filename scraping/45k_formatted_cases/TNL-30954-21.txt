In the matter
of:


1101, 35 CANYON
AVENUE TORONTO ON M3H4Y2


 




Between:


35 Canyon Limited


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Eddie
Zaretsky


Tenant



 
35 Canyon Limited (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Eddie Zaretsky (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on July 16, 2021, October
22, 2021 and December 20, 2021.
 
The Landlord
and the Landlord's Legal Representative Rachel Gibbons
and the Tenant
attended the hearings. The Tenant did not attend the October 22, 2021
hearing and the Landlord requested that the matter be adjourned to permit the
Tenant to attend. An adjournment was granted and the hearing proceeded and
concluded on December 20, 2021.
 
Preliminary Matter:
 
The Tenant had requested
an in-person hearing
of the matter as an accommodation as he stated that due to a hearing impairment
it was difficult for him to participate by video conference as the telephone or
computer speaker systems interfered with or lessened his hearing ability. An
in- person hearing was denied and the Board accommodated the Tenant by
providing assistance at a Board site at a Public Access Terminal, with a
Information Technology staff member to assist when and if needed.
 
In the course of the hearing,
the Tenant was able to present his position and submissions clearly and to respond to all of my questions appropriately and fully,
meaning the answers
of the Tenant clearly indicated an understanding of the questions
asked. The Tenant testified that his concerns with the Landlord’s application
were in relation to the Above Guideline Increase and an overcharging for
parking fees. In the course of the 2 hearing dates, the Tenant presented his
argument and was able to challenge the Landlord’s evidence. On this basis, I
found that the Tenant was reasonably able to participate in the proceedings and the hearing proceeded by way of
video conference.




 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for
the period from June 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The Landlord states
that the lawful monthly rent is $2,219.23. The Tenant disputes the rent calculation as he asserts
that the Above Guideline Increase
was applied incorrectly over the three years of the
Board’s Above Guideline order.
 
4.    
The Tenant
has paid 19,824.46
since the application was filed.
 
5.    
For the reasons set out below,
I find that the lawful
monthly rent is $2,219.23.
 
6.    
The Tenant
owes the amount
of $4,376.00 to December 31,
2021.
 
Dispute of Rent
Arrears
 
7.    
It was undisputed that
the Landlord obtained an order of the Board TNL-04656-18-C dated July 25, 2019
for an Above Guideline Increase of rent. The order permitted an 8.5% increase,
which pursuant to subsection 126(11) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, (the ‘Act’) was permitted over a 3 year period
as follows: 3.0% year one, 3.0% year 2,
and 2.5% in year 3. Pursuant to paragraph 3 of the Board’s order, the Above Guideline
Increase is in in addition to the statutory increases permitted on an annual
basis.
 
8.    
The Tenant asserts that
the Landlord improperly applied the increases as they failed to apply the increases to the “base
rent” that existed
in 2018, the year of the first
increase. The Tenant takes the position that over the 3 years, the
increase for each year should apply to the rent rate for the year 2018. He
states that the Landlord has wrongly compounded the increase annually.
 
9.    
The Landlord takes the
position that each year the rent rate is established and any increases that they are entitled to apply, are to be applied to the most recent year’s
rent rate.
 
Analysis
 
10.  Having reviewed the file and considered the
submissions and evidence of the parties, I find that the Above Guideline Increase
has been properly
applied over the course of the 3 year period of the permitted increase. I
therefore find that the rent arrears calculated in the amount of $4,376.00, is
correct.
 
11.  Pursuant to subsection 119(1) a landlord
may lawfully increase the rent charged to a tenant if at lest 12 months have elapsed
since the last rent increase
for that tenant in that rental unit; therefore a landlord may
increase the rent every 12 months.




 
12.  Pursuant to subsection 120(1) of the Act, a
landlord may only increase the rent charged to a tenant in accordance with the guideline, except in accordance to section 126. Section
126 of the Act permits a landlord to apply to the Board for an order permitting
the rent charged to be increased by more than the guideline amount in certain
circumstances. This is the case here.
 
13.  The Act permits the rent to be increased
annually by the guideline, and where an order has been granted by the Board, by an Above Guideline Increase (‘AGI’). As per all annual
increases, they are based/calculated on the most current rent rate charged. The
calculation is the year’s rent rate, multiplied by the guideline and where
permitted the AGI. Annual rent
increases are not attached to the “original” lease rate agreed to by the
parties at the start of the tenancy, nor are AGIs attached to the rent rate at
the time a landlord applies for an order granting an AGI. Rent increases are
always calculated on the basis of the most recent rent rate paid by a tenant.
Therefore, each individual year allows for an annual percentage increase of the
current rent rate.
 
14.  I find that the Landlord
was permitted to calculate the annual rent increase percentage on the most recent rent rate charged for each year. I find that
the rent rate was not “frozen” for 3 years at the 2018 rent rate, with the
permitted Above Guideline Increase to be charged each of the 3 years at the 2018
rent rate. This is not how annual guideline increases are calculated and it is
not how an Above Guideline Increase is calculated.
 
15.  The Act is consistent in its application
and calculation of rent increases for both the guideline amount and an Above Guideline
amount. In both cases an increase is based on the last/most recently charged legal
rent rate.
 
16.  As I find that the rent increases
were calculated properly
by the Landlord, the Tenant’s claim for overcharging of rent is
dismissed.
 
Section 82: Illegal
Charges
 
17.  The Tenant asserts
that he has been charged
for 7 years for a parking
spot that he does not have. He
states that these charges are from 2005 to 2012.
 
18.  The Landlord’s employee Jeff Goldband
(‘JG’) testified that the Tenant was incorrectly charged $75.00 for a parking
spot and they immediately reversed the charges on the Tenant’s ledger; no money
was collected from the Tenant but an accounting entry was made on the ledger
in error and corrected. The Landlord testified
that this typographical error occurred on the
Tenant’s rent ledger as follows: on March 1, 2012 and corrected March 1, 2021. (Landlord’s Exhibit 1 Tenant Ledger –
December 20, 2021)
 
19.  Based on the evidence before the Board, I
find that the Tenant’s ledger contained
two entries for a parking
spot – the addition and deletion of a charge.
I find that the Tenant
was not charged for the parking spot for a 7 year period. As there was no
evidence to show that there was an on-going improper charge for parking, the
Tenant’s claim for reimbursement for parking charges is dismissed.




 
20.  Additionally, even had there been an
improper charge for 7 years, ending in 2012, the Tenant would not be entitled to reimbursement of such charges
pursuant to 136(1)
which states that rent charged one or more years earlier shall be deemed
to be lawful rent unless an application has been made within one year after the
date the amount was first charged. Further, subsection 135(2) prohibits a
tenant from filing an application for the retention of money retained
in contravention of the Act, filed more than one year after
the person collected or retained the money.
 
Section 83 Considerations
 
21.  Prior to the hearing of the matter, the
Landlord and the Tenant entered into a repayment agreement under section 206 of the Act, signed
on June 11, 2021. (Exhibit 2 –
December 20, 2021) The Tenant testified that he did not dispute that he owed
rent arrears, but that he no longer agreed to make the payments set out in the
agreement as he disputed the arrears amount based on the misapplication of the Above Guideline Increase.
The Tenant testified that he
agreed he owed arrears and would pay them once calculated correctly.
 
22.  The Landlord testified that they do not
seek a termination of the Tenancy but sought a repayment plan on the basis of
the signed section 206 agreement, being a monthly payment of $228.00 until the arrears
were paid in full. The Tenant testified that he would not propose a repayment plan unless
the calculation of arrears were justified.
 
23.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction subject to the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. I
find that the terms of repayment proposed by the Landlord are reasonable, and it was uncontested
that the Tenant had previously agreed to the monthly payment amount of
$228.00 as affordable. As a result, the Tenant will be ordered to repay the
outstanding arrears of rent as proposed.
 
24.  The Landlord has incurred the cost of $186.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
 
It
is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4,562.00, which represents the arrears of rent
($4,376.00), and costs ($186.00) outstanding for the period ending December 31,
2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s application for eviction
of the Tenant is denied
on the condition that:
 
(a)  
The Tenant
shall make the following payment
to the Landlord in respect
of the monies owing under
paragraph 1 of this order:




 
 



Date Payment
Due


Amount of Payment




First day of each month:
 
From February 1, 2022 to
August 1, 2023
inclusive


$228.00
 
(arrears)




September 1, 2023


$230.00
 
(costs
and arrears)



 
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay the Landlord the lawful rent on
or before the first day of each and every month from February 2022
to September 2023 inclusive.
 
4.        
If the Tenant fails
to make any of the payments in accordance with paragraph 2 and or 3,
and by the dates required, then:
 
(a)  
The Landlord may apply
under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for
an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, and for the payment
of any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not already ordered under paragraph
1 of this order. The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a
breach of a condition set out in paragraph 2 of this order.
 
(b)   The balance owing under paragraph 1 of this
order shall become payable on the day following the date of default.
The monies owing shall bear interest
at the post-judgment interest
rate determined under subsection 207(7) of the Act.
