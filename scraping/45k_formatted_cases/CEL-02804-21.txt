Order under Section

Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-02804-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


158, 7230 DARCEL
AVENUE MISSISSAUGA ON L4T3T6


 




Between:


IMH Pool XX


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Debbie
Anthony Kevin Adams


Tenants



 
 
IMH Pool XX (the
'Landlord') applied for an order requiring Debbie Anthony and Kevin Adams (the
'Tenants') to pay compensation for the money they should have paid had they not
misrepresented their income or the income of a member of their family. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after
the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 6,
2022.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Tricia
Radam, attended the hearing.
As of 10:29 a.m., the
Tenants were not present
or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice
of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
For the reasons that follow the Landlord’s application with respect to compensation is granted.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s L2 application sought
termination of the tenancy based on the Tenants’
dismissal as building
superintendents. The Tenants vacated the rental unit on October 15, 2021. The Tenants were still in possession of
the rental unit as of the date the application was filed.
 
3.    
The Landlord's Legal
Representative submitted that the Tenants lived in a superintendent’s unit and
their employment as superintendent ended on July 15, 021. The termination
letter was entered into evidence. As the Tenants have vacated, the Landlord is seeking an order for the rent from July 23, 2021, which takes into account
the 7-day legislated rent-free period, to October 15, 2021.
 
4.    
The monthly
rent is $1,967.35. The Landlord
is not holding a last month rent
deposit.
 
5.    
The rent owing from July 23, 2021 through
October 15, 2021 is $3,428.04, calculated as follows:




File Number: CEL-02804-21
 
 
 
July 23, 2021 through
October 15, 2021 is 53
days
$1,967.35 X 12 = $23,608.20 ÷ 365 days per year = $64.68 53
days X $64.68 per diem = $3,428.04
 
6.    
This order contains all the reasons
for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$3,428.04 for rent from July 23, 2021 through
October 15, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
The total
amount the Tenants
owe the Landlord is $3,614.04.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before January 21, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 22,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
