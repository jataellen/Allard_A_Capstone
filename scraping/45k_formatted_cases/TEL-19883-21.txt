Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19883-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


102, 141 CONANT
STREET OSHAWA ON L1H 3R7


 




Between:


Avenue Place
Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jennifer Prendercast
  Raymond Leblanc


Tenants



 
 
 
Avenue Place Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jennifer Prendercast and Raymond Leblanc
(the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
19, 2022. The Landlord’s Agent, Peter
Sitkiewicz attended the hearing. The Tenants were not present or represented at
the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 23, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,189.00
as of January 1, 2022.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,175.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     The Tenants paid $4,985.00 after
the application was filed.
 
6.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.

It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 8, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$729.04*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 25, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $39.09
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 26,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before March 8, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from March 9,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 8, 2022, then starting
March 9, 2022, the

the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant
possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 9, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenants
wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)    
$2,279.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022,
or
ii)    
$3,468.00 if the payment
is made on or before
March 8, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not make full
payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline,
then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March 9, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
