Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-18098-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


UPPER UNIT, 1166
VENUS CRESCENT OSHAWA ON
  L1J6E4


 




Between:


Joshua Galliford
  Erica Galliford


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Kimberly Howes


Tenant



 
 
 
Joshua Galliford and Erica Galliford (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Kimberly
Howes (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted
in the residential complex has wilfully caused
undue damage to the premises and used the rental unit
or the residential complex in a manner that is inconsistent with use as a
residential premises and that has caused or can be expected to cause
significant damage.
 
This application was heard on February
1, 2022. The Landlords, represented by Han Hao, and
the Tenant, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlords served
an N7 notice. The legal test for this notice
in order to lead to the
termination of the tenancy is as stated above.
Any damage caused must be wilful and
any inconsistent use of the rental unit must be reasonably expected to cause
serious damage.
 
2.    
The notice alleges the Tenant
removed a light fixture, repainted trim, baseboard and walls, and repaired a
wall. The notice alleges the Tenant
is running a hair styling salon which may affect
the Landlords’ insurance. There are individuals going into the unit and leave with different hair.
 
3.     I find the allegations in the notice
to not rise to the level of serious damage
or inconsistent use of the
rental unit that would reasonably be expected to cause serious damage.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlords' application is dismissed.
