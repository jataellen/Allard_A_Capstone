Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-36630-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


BASEMENT UNIT, 99 GOSFORD BOULEVARD TORONTO ON M3N2G9


 




Between:


Lord Demetri Doctor Denis Duldulao Rosalinda
  Duldulao


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Luu Ha Luu Son


Tenants



 
 
Lord Demetri Doctor, Denis Duldulao and Rosalinda Duldulao
(the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Luu Ha and Luu Son (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
entered into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlords’ application is made under
section 77 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
“Act”).
 
2.     In any such application, subsection 77(2) of the Act
requires that “[t]he landlord shall include
with the application an affidavit verifying the agreement or notice of termination,
as the case may be.”
 
3.     No such affidavit has been included with the
Landlords’ application. The only
affidavits which were provided
appear to be drafted in contemplation of subsection 72(1) of the Act,
which are immaterial to an application under section 77.
 
4.     The Landlords’ application therefore fails to comply with a mandatory filing requirement of supporting evidence, and must be dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlords' application is dismissed.
