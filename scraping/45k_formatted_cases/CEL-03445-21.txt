1470
Williamsport Holdings Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Howard Wheeler (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or a person the Tenant permitted in the residential
complex has seriously impaired the safety of any person.
 
This
application was heard by video conference on February 2, 2022. The Landlord's
Legal Representative, H. Levenson and the Tenant's Legal Representative, V.
Arulsundaram attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     On October 25, 2021, the Landlord served the Tenant
with a 10-Day Notice to Terminate a Tenancy Early (N7) with a termination date
of November 5, 2021. The Landlord alleged in
the notice that a Canada Post employee
reported an incident
that violated Canada
Post’s ‘violence in the workplace policy’.
 
2.     A notice of termination given by a Landlord must set out the reasons
and details respecting the termination. In Ball v. Metro Capital Property,
[2002] O.J. No. 5931, the Divisional Court decided that the notice given by the Landlord
lacked sufficient details
and that the purpose
of the notice is to ensure the Tenant knows
the case to be met and is in a position to decide
whether or not to dispute the allegations at a hearing.
 
3.     In this case, the notice
did not specify
the act the Landlord alleges
impaired anyone’s safety in the residential complex.
Therefore, I find the notice
defective and the Board will not issue an order terminating the tenancy without
a valid notice of termination.
