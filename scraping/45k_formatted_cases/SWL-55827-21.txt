Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55827-21
 



In the
  matter of:


3, 1267 DUNDAS
STREET LONDON ON N5W3B3


 




Between:


Debbie Agnew


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Jose Da Silva


Tenant



 
Debbie Agnew (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jose Da
Silva (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 27, 2022. As
of 10:56 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this
hearing by the Board. The Landlord
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period
from January 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $725.00.
 
4.     The Tenant made no payments
after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $725.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from August 3, 2019 to
November 30, 2021.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 21, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $3,324.52*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
10, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$23.84 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 11, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 21, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 21, 2022, then starting February
22, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 22, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February
21, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $4,711.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit. If this payment is not made
in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after February 22, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
 
February 10, 2022 Date Issued
 
South West-RO, 150 Dufferin
Avenue, Suite 400, 4th Floor,
