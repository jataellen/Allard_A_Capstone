In the matter
of:


8 LUZON AVENUE MARKHAM ON L6B1N6


 




Between:


Nicolaos Koundouros


Tenant




 


 
and


 




 


Oleg Masliy
Anlema Holdings Limited


Landlords



 
Nicolaos Koundouros (the 'Tenant') applied
for an order determining that Oleg Masliy and Anlema Holdings Limited (the 'Landlords') collected or retained
money illegally.
 
The hearing was held by videoconference on February 3, 2022. The
Tenant was present at the hearing. As of 11:45 am, neither of
the Landlords were present nor
represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
T1 Application
 
1.     
On February 1, 2021 the Tenant applied to the Board, pursuant to s. 135(1) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), with a T1 application (T1) alleging that the
Landlord has illegally retained a key deposit of $250.00, and has not paid interest
on the Tenant’s rent deposit
in the amount of $90.00.
 
2.     
The Tenant moved into the rental unit on August 30, 2018, and vacated the unit on August
1, 2020. The Tenant alleges that the Landlord did not provide him the
$250.00 key deposit and $90.00 in
rent deposit interest on August 1, 2020,
and that the Landlord continues to retain these funds. Given that this application
was filed within the one-year
limitation period contained in
section 135(4) of the Act, both of
the Tenant’s allegations will be
considered.
 
Key Deposit
 
3.     
The Tenant testified that he paid the Landlord a $250.00 key deposit on August
30, 2018, the day he moved into the rental unit. The
Tenant submitted Schedule A of his
lease agreement for the unit, and noted that this schedule states that the
$250.00 deposit will be returned to the Tenant when the unit keys are returned to the Landlord at the termination of the tenancy.




 
4.     
The Tenant testified further that when he vacated the rental unit on August 1, 2020, he provided the Landlord with all of the original unit keys that he
had been given, plus an additional key. The Tenant stated
that on August 1, 2020
he asked the Landlord for the
$250.00 key deposit; however,
the Landlord refused
and advised the Tenant that he
would receive
it later. The Tenant remarked that he tried approximately
another 10 times, using text messages and emails, to receive the key
deposit from the Landlord, but the
Landlord did not respond to a single
message.
 
Analysis
 
5.     
Section 17 of O.Reg. 516/06 under the Act permits a landlord to collect:
 
3. Payment of a refundable key,
remote entry device
or card deposit, not greater than the expected direct
replacement costs
 
[emphasis added]
 
6.  
Section 135(1) states:
 
A tenant or former tenant of a rental unit may apply to the Board for
an order that the landlord, superintendent or agent of the
landlord pay to the tenant any money
the person collected or retained in
contravention of this Act or
the Tenant Protection Act, 1997.
 
7.     
On the basis of the
Tenant’s uncontested evidence, I find that on August 30, 2018 the Landlord collected a $250.00 key deposit from the Tenant. I further find that
the Tenant returned the unit keys to the
Landlord when the tenancy
terminated on August 1, 2020. However, as of the date of this
hearing, the Landlord has not returned
the $250.00 key deposit to
the Tenant, as required by section
17 of O.Reg. 516/06. Therefore, I find that the
Landlord’s failure to return the $250.00 key deposit to the
Tenant is contrary to s. 135(1) of
the Act.
Rent Deposit Interest
 
8.     
The Tenant testified that he provided the
Landlord a $2200.00 rent deposit
on August 30, 2018, the day he moved into the rental unit. The
Tenant stated that the rent
deposit was used to pay
for his last month’s rent on July
1, 2020; however,
the Landlord never paid him
interest on this rent deposit throughout the duration of the tenancy, or
when he vacated the rental unit on August 1, 2020.
 
9.     
The Tenant alleges
that the Landlord owes him
$90.00 in interest for the $2200.00 rent deposit that the Landlord held for
the period of August 30, 2018 to June 30, 2020.
 
Analysis
 
10.               
Section 106(6) of the Act states:




 
A landlord of a rental
unit shall pay interest
to the tenant annually on the
amount of the rent deposit at a rate equal to the guideline determined under section 120 that is in effect at the time paymen t becomes due.
 
11.  
On the basis
of the Tenant’s uncontested evidence,
I find that on August 30, 2018 the Landlord collected
a $2200.00 rent deposit from
the Tenant, and that this deposit was used for the
July 2020 rent payment.
I further find that the Landlord, upon the termination
of the Tenant’s tenancy
on August 1, 2020, did not pay the Tenant interest on the rent
deposit over the period of August 31, 2018 to June 30, 2020.
 
12.  
The guideline interest
rate in 2018 and 2019
pursuant to s. 120 of the Act was 1.8%, and for 2020 it was
2.2%. The $2200.00 rent deposit
from August 31, 2018
to December 31, 2019 generated
interest of $52.80 using an interest rate of 1.8%. The rent deposit from January
1, 2020 to June 30, 2020
generated further interest of $24.20 using an interest rate of
2.2%. The total interest generated
from August 31, 2018 to
June 30, 2020 was
$77.00. Therefore, I find that the Landlords owe the Tenant a total of $77.00 in rent deposit interest
pursuant to s. 106(6) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Landlords shall pay to the Tenant the sum of $327.00. This amount represents
$250.00
collected for the key deposit, and $77.00 for interest on the last month's rent deposit.
 
2.     
The Landlords shall also pay to the Tenant
$53.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     
The total amount the Landlords owe to the Tenant is $380.00.
 
4.     
If the Landlord does not pay the Tenant the full amount owing by March 15, 2022, the Landlord will owe interest. This will be simple
interest calcul ated from March 16,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
