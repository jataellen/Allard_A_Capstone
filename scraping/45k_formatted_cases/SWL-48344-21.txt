Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number: SWL-48344-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
401, 1299 HURON
STREET LONDON ON N5Y4M1


 




Between:


Terracorp Management Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kyle Vanderheiden


Tenant



 
 
Terracorp Management Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kyle Vanderheiden (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or
someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for
each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on November 29, 2021. The Landlord's Legal Representative, Kevin O’Brien, and
the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     In the present case, there was no dispute that the
lease agreement between the parties requires the Tenant to have content, fire
and liability insurance and to provide proof that he has the requisite
tenant insurance in full force and effect upon request
of the Landlord. The Landlord also demonstrated that it requested the
required proof of insurance prior to filing this application.
 
Landlord is not barred
from enforcing its right
 
2.    
The Tenant takes the position that
Landlord’s failure to enforce the tenant insurance provision of the lease agreement for the past 10 years bars the Landlord from enforcing it now. I disagree with the Tenant for the
reasons below.
 
3.     The Landlord’s delay in enforcing this lawful right is
irrelevant. As the wording of paragraph 22 of the tenancy
agreement permitted the Landlord to make its request “at any
time,” the delay in
enforcing that right
is of no consequence and within the agreed
terms of the contract. The right to be provided with the Tenant’s proof of
insurance coverage upon request
“at any time” was also not extinguished or diminished over the
course of the tenancy. Therefore, the Landlord is not barred from enforcing
this right pursuant to the lease agreement.




 
4.    
Having determined that the Landlord’s rights
under section 22 of the lease agreement
is not extinguished, I must determine whether the Tenant’s breach of
this section constitutes substantial interference with the Landlord’s lawful
rights.
 
5.    
In Stanbar Properties Ltd. v. Rooke [2005] O.J. No. 6363 (Ont. Cup.Ct.,
Div.) at para. 10, the Ontario Superior Court made the
following finding:
 
The refusals of the respondent
to arrange for pre-authorized debit and to provide proof of insurance coverage
were in breach
of consensual provisions of the tenancy agreement to which he was a part
and, in the language of section 64(1) of the Act, his refusals substantially
interfered with the appellant’s lawful rights acquired by it as a result of the
agreement.
 
6.    
In accordance with Stanbar, I find that the Tenant’s
failure or refusal
to provide requested proof of insurance coverage
served as a complete interference with that lawful right.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act. The Landlord sought a conditional order requiring the Tenant to provide proof of tenant’s
insurance and the Tenant agreed that he would if ordered by the Board.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.   
The Landlord’s application for
eviction of the Tenant is denied on the condition that the Tenant shall obtain
content, fire and liability insurance in accordance with paragraph 22 of the lease agreement on or before March
5, 2022.
 
2.   
If the Tenant fails to
comply with the conditions set out in paragraph 1 above, then, within
30 days of the
breach, the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenant. The Landlord must make the application
within 30 days of a breach of a condition set out in paragraph 1 of this
order.
 
3.   
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.   
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing on or before February 14, 2022, the Tenant will
start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February
15, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
