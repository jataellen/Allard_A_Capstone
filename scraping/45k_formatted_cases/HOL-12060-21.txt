Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12060-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


BASEMENT BDR,
14 ARCHWAY TRAIL BRAMPTON ON L6P4E3


 




Between:


Mukeshkumar Patel
  Vibhavari Patel


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Amrit Kaur
Karandeep Aka Karanveer Singh


Tenants



 
 
 
Mukeshkumar Patel and Vibhavari
Patel (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Karandeep Aka Karanveer Singh and Amrit
Kaur (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by way
of video conference on January 10, 2022. The
Landlord Mukeshkumar Patel attended
the hearing and was represented by Bruce Parsons,
Paralegal. The Tenant Karanveer Singh attended the hearing and was
represented by Mehakpreet Randawa, Paralegal.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant’s vacated
the rental unit on November
5, 2021, and I find that the tenancy
ended on that date.
 
2.    
The application is amended
to reflect that the monthly
rent is due on the first day of each month.
 
Preliminary request:
 
3.    
The Tenant’s legal representative
requested that the Board dismiss the Landlord’s L1 application because
the Tenant was not served
a N4 notice of termination. The Landlord disputed
this allegation and was adamant that a N4 was served to the Tenants.
 
4.    
An L1 application seeks two
remedies under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act). The first
remedy is termination of tenancy pursuant
to section 69. The second
is an order for the rent
arrears owing pursuant to section 87.




 
5.    
As the tenancy has already ended,
the Landlord’s application to terminate the tenancy pursuant to section 69
remedy is moot as is the issue of whether the Tenant was served with the N4
notice of termination. Had the Tenants still been in possession, the Board
would need make a determination regarding the service
of the N4 as this is a requirement
to terminate a tenancy.
 
6.     There is no dispute that the Tenant was served with
the L1 application. Therefore, I proceeded to hear the Landlord’s claim for arrears
of rent pursuant
to section 87 of the Act.
 
Arrears owing:
 
7.    
The monthly rent was $1,300.00 per month.
 
8.     The Landlord provided
oral testimony at the hearing
and stated that the Tenant has paid no rent for the months of July,
August, September, October and November 2021.
 
9.    
The Tenant testified that he paid rent to the Landlords
each month in cash on the first day of each month and does not owe any
rent arrears. The Tenants did not submit any
receipt of payment, bank records or confirmation from the Landlord that
the funds were paid.
 
10. 
The Landlord
denies that any funds
were received and claims
that the Tenants
owe rent for the months of
July 2021 through to November 2021.
 
11. 
In Mauti v.
Gibbs, 2019 ONSC 3355 (CanLII), the Divisional Court held at paragraph 27
that while the Landlord bears the burden of proof in a rent arrears
application, it is it is difficult for a landlord to prove a negative (i.e. non-payment of rent). Therefore, “. . .while the ultimate persuasive burden
never shifts, once a landlord denies receiving funds, the tenant will have an
evidentiary burden or a chance to advance some evidence to positively prove
that he or she paid rent.”
 
12. 
I find that the Landlord’s evidence
establishes, on a balance of probabilities, that the
Tenants owe to the Landlords arrears of rent for the period from July 1, 2021
to November 5, 2021. As stated, the
Tenants provided no evidence supporting that payment was made and accepted by
the Landlord.
 
13.  The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,300.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
14.  Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from September 9, 2020 to September 13, 2021.




 
 
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated effective November
5, 2021, the day vacant possession was returned to the Landlord.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $4,119.51*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to November 5, 2021,
less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing* on or before March 1, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 2, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
