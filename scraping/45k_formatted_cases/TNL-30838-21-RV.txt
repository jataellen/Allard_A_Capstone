Review Order
 
Summit Holdings (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Erica Thomas (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved by order TNL-30838-21 issued on September
21, 2021. On November 8, 2021,
the Tenant requested a review of the order.
The request was heard by videoconference on January 14, 2022.
 
Only the Tenant and the Tenant’s
legal representative Kwang-Sheng Wen attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Review
 
1.     The Tenant’s request
for a review is based on the ground of being not reasonably able to
participate in the proceedings.
 
2.    
The hearing that gave rise to the order
under review took place on June 16, 2021. The Tenant did not attend and did not
send a representative.
 
3.    
At the review hearing
the Tenant testified
that she logged into zoom but was not let into
the hearing. The Tenant testified that she tried several times to get into the hearing but could not. She testified that
she contacted Board staff and they said to send an email.
 
4.    
Based on the Tenant’s
uncontested evidence, I find, on a balance
of probabilities, that the
Tenant was not reasonably able to participate in the proceedings. At the hearing
I granted the review request
and heard the Landlord’s L1 application de novo.




File Number: TNL-30838-21-RV
 
L1 application
 
5.     Since the Landlord
did not appear at the hearing to support the application, I find that this
application has been abandoned.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
