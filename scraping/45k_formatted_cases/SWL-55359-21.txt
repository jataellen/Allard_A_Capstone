Hazelview Property Services Inc.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Dale Kerr (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 13, 2022. The Landlord’s Legal Representative, Tim Currie, and the
Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant was in possession of the rental
unit on the date the application was filed.
 
2.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period
from February 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $825.49.
 
4.    
The only amount outstanding is $639.31 in rent arrears
and the Landlord's cost of filing the application. As a result, the
order will be limited to arrears and costs only and not eviction.
 
5.     The Tenant paid $3,382.00 after the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $639.31, which represents the amount of rent owing up to January 31, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.

If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before

will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 2, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
