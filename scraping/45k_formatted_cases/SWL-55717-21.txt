In the matter
of:


5,

N TILBURY ON N0P2L0


 




Between:

Properties


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Gilbert Moody-Beaule


Tenant



 
 
North Shore Properties (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Gilbert Moody-Beaule (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 20, 2022. Only Run Cheem attended the hearing. The Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this
hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
Attending the hearing on behalf of the Landlord
was Run Cheem, an employee
of a property management
company responsible for overseeing this rental complex.
 
2.     The representative indicated that the company
represents multiple different Landlords.
 
3.    
When asked if the representative was a licenced paralegal or lawyer, they indicated that they were not. When asked if there was any
other exemption under which
they qualified to represent a party
in front of the Board they were not able to provide one.
 
4.    
As the party in attendance does not meet the requirements to represent a party in a
Board hearing, the application is considered abandoned and cannot proceed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
