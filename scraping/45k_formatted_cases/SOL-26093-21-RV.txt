Maya Naji


Tenant



 
 
Review Order
 
 
Nimmi Khurana (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Maya Naji (the
'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes
because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on April 27, 2021 with
respect to application SOL-17384-20.
 
This application was resolved by order SOL-26093-21 issued on January 4, 2022.
On January 30, 2022, the Tenant requested a review of the order.
A preliminary review of the review
request was completed without a hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     On the basis of the submissions made in the request, I am not satisfied that there is a
serious error in the order or that a serious error occurred in the proceedings.
 
2.     Board order SOL-26093-21 was issued on January 4, 2022 as an ex parte order.
Instead of filing a motion to set aside that order under subsection
78(9) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’), the Tenant
requested a review of the order under section
21.2 of the Statutory Powers Procedure Act.
 
3.     The Tenant submits that a serious error occurred in
the Board’s process, resulting in the January
4, 2022 ex parte order.
The Tenant explains
that they did not receive
a notice of termination or notice of hearing in
relation to the January 4, 2022 order.
 
4.     The parties attended at a Board hearing on April 13,
2021 and consented to the April 27, 2021 hearing order,
SOL-17384-20. That order allowed the Landlord to file an application




File Number: SOL-26093-21-RV
 
to the Board under
subsection 78(1) of the Act, without notice
to the Tenant, if the Tenant
breached a condition in the order. Contrary
to the Tenant’s belief, the Landlord was therefore not required to give the
Tenant a new notice of termination
and the Tenant was not entitled to
notice of the Landlord’s application.
 
5.     In this present case, the Board issued its ex parte
order under section 78 of the Act because the Tenant did not pay the Landlord
$700.00 toward arrears on or before November
4, 2021. The Tenant’s review
request does not submit that this determination is a serious error of fact.
 
6.     Since the Tenant did not demonstrate that a serious
error occurred in the Board’s process, or that a serious
error of fact exists in the January
4, 2022 ex parte order,
the Tenant’s review request must be denied.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The request to review
order SOL-26093-21 issued
on January 4, 2022 is denied.
The order is confirmed and remains unchanged.
