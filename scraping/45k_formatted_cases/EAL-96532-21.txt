Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number: EAL-96532-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
B1, 89 KING STREET W BROCKVILLE ON K6V3R1


 




Between:


8444706 Canada
Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kayla Moore


Tenant



 
 
 
8444706 Canada Inc (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kayla Moore (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on November
2, 2021. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Sandeep Kapoor, attended the
hearing. As of 3:27 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
July 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 17,
2021.
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,400.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,400.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for
the period from February 1, 2021 to July 17, 2021.
7.    
I have considered
all of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 28, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $7,551.36*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
17, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $46.03
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 18, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 28, 2022, then starting
January 29, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 29, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before January 28, 2022, the Tenant pays the
amount of $9,686.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for
eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after January
29, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
