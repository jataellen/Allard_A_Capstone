Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-33912-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


510, 20 SHALLMAR BOULEVARD TORONTO ON M5N1J5


 




Between:


Capreit Limited Partnership


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Carina Neves


Tenant



 
 
 
Capreit Limited Partnership (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Carina Neves (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque
charges and related administration charges.
 
This application was heard by
teleconference on November
8, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s representative, J. Paine, and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period from
July 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 31,
2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord incurred charges
of $5.00 for a cheque
tendered by or on behalf
of the Tenant, which was
returned NSF and $20.00 for related administration charges.
 
3.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,834.49 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
4.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 1, 2020 to July
31, 2021.
 
5.     The Tenant paid $3,668.98 after
the application was filed, including
the rent for November 2021.
 
6.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
The Tenant indicated that she could pay all the arrears by November
30, 2021.
