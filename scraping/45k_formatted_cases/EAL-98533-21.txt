1960 Scott Holding Inc (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ashley Adams
and Akobi Adams (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 15, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Yatyin Cheng, attended the hearing. As of
2:25 p.m., the Tenants were not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective November 4, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
vacated the rental
unit on December 31, 2021.
The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $2,495.00.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $200.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from November
2, 2021 to November 4, 2021.
