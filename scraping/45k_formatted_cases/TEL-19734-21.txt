Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19734-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


2, 448
GLEN MILLER ROAD TORONTO ON K8V5P8


 




Between:


Wieslaw Sadowski


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Amanda Collett
  John Hartwick


Tenants



 
 
Wieslaw Sadowski (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict John Hartwick and Amanda Collett (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did
not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 5, 2022.   Only the Landlord
attended the hearing. As of
3:37 p.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 25, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,200.00.
 
4.    
The Tenants have made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,200.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from September 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the




 
Tenants, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 6, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $6,429.83*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 26, 2022, less
the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$39.45 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 27, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or
before February 6, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 7,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 6, 2022, then starting
February 7, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 7, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$7,986.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$9,186.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 6, 2022**.
If the Tenants
do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 7, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
