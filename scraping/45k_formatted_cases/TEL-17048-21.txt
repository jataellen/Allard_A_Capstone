Donald Baker Holly Lynch


Tenants




 
 
 
Asha Sharma (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Holly Lynch and Donald Baker (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on August 18, 2021. The
Landlord’s Agent, Amit Sharma, and the Tenants attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from April 1, 2021 to August 31,
2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective May 17, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $2,400.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is holding a last month’s
rent deposit that exceeds the current monthly
rent, which is not permitted
by the Act. The Tenants have been credited with $1,000.00, which is the difference between the amount
currently held and the permissible amount, and this credit is reflected on the Schedule
as a payment. The last month's rent deposit now equals the current monthly
rent.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $2,400.00
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.




File Number: TEL-17048-21
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from December 12, 2020 to May 17, 2021.
 
7.     The Tenants paid $1,100.00 after
the application was filed.
The Tenants say they paid more but did not provide sufficient
evidence to prove their claim.
 
8.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until April 1, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. The
parties agree to the termination date below.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
April 1, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $21,490.13*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 23, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$78.90 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 24,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before April 1, 2022, the Tenants will start
to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from April 2, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated on or before
April 1, 2022, then starting April 2,
2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 2, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$24,486.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022,
or
ii)             
$29,286.00 if the payment
is made on or before
April 1, 2022**.
If the Tenants
do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after
April 2, 2022 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are




File Number: TEL-17048-21
 
only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
