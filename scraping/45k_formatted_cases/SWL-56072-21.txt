Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-56072-21



In the
  matter of:


UNIT B, 29 WILLOW STREET WATERLOO ON N2J1V7


 




Between:


Isaac Morland Maria
Andrusiak


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Jason St. Jean


Tenant



 
 
Isaac Morland and Maria Andrusiak (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Jason
St. Jean (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 3, 2022.
 
The Landlord, Isaac Morlan,
the Landlords’ Legal
Representative, Timothy Mobberley, and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
The application is amended
to remove Blake
Fugina as a party, and to correct
the Tenant’s last name from Knowlton to St. Jean.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period
from October 1, 2020 to February 28, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of
Termination effective October 22, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,700.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $800.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlords.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from October 1, 2020 to
October 22, 2021.
 
7.     At the onset of the hearing the tenant raised a preliminary issue concerning the legality of the Landlords shared use of space
outside of the Tenant’s rental unit. The
Tenant




File Number: SWL-56072-21
 
alleged that the tenancy
is exempt under the Act because the Landlord has the ability
to share a bathroom with the Tenant and that the Landlord shares the
same hallway.
 
8.     The Landlord testified that they do not share a kitchen
or a bathroom with the Tenant and that the hallway has always been
shared with the Tenant and that this issue had been discussed with the Tenant
prior to them taking possession of the rental unit. The Landlord testified that they never use the bathroom because
it is designated as the Tenants bathroom which is included in the Tenants
lease.
 
9.    
Based on the evidence before me, I
find that the rental unit is not exempt under subsection 5(i) of the Act because
it was clear that the bathroom was not shared
by both the Landlord and the
Tenant. The Tenant has exclusive use
of the bathroom.
 
10.  After the hearing
began, the Tenant requested an adjournment so that they could provide submissions and evidence pursuant
to section 82 of the Act. The Tenant
indicated that they had filed their own applications and wanted me to consider
them in light of the Landlords application for nonpayment of rent.
 
11.  The Landlord was opposed to the adjournment
because of the substantial arrears and because the Tenant indicated
that they already
filed their applications which would not preclude any of the Tenants issues
being considered at their own merits hearing with respect to those issues.
 
12.  After considering the submissions of both parties
and the potential prejudice, I denied the Tenants request for an adjournment and
instead considered delaying termination of the tenancy. Neither party was opposed to the extension of time.
 
13.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until March 20, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of
the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order
as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 20, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $12,214.99*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 24, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords
$55.89 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 25, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.

5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount
owing* on or before March
20, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 21, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 20, 2022, then starting March 21, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that
the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after March 21, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlords or to the Board in trust:
i)          
$13,486.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022, or
ii)         
$15,186.00 if the payment
is made on or before
March 20, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not
make full payment in accordance
with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this
order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March
21, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once
during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
