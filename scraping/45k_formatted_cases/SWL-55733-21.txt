Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55733-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


109 MACATEE PLACE CAMBRIDGE ON N1R7G5


 




Between:


John
  Son


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kelly Smith


Tenant



 
 
 
John Son (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kelly
Smith (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 20, 2022. Only
the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Eric Schroeder, attended the hearing. As
of 9:54 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this
hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from September 1, 2021 to
January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective October 12, 2021.
 
2.    
The application is amended to reflect the rent for October 2021 as unpaid
at the time the application
was filed.
 
3.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
4.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,527.00.
 
5.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
6.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.

is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$9,348.00 if the payment

If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the

Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or

period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
