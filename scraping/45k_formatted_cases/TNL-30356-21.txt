Alex Gittens Jaminah Z. Peter


Tenants




 
Amstar Pool I LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jaminah
Z. Peter and Alex Gittens (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 1, 2022. The Landlord's Legal Representative,
Tricia Radam, attended the hearing. As of 1:06 p.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from November 1, 2020 to February
28, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination.
 
2.    
The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful monthly rent is $1,227.52.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,142.65 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
1, 2021 to January 31, 2021.
 
6.    
The Tenants paid $3,900.00
after the application was filed.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants
must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 22, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$12,215.17*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 11, 2022,
less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$40.36 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 12, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
22, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 23, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 22, 2022, then starting
February 23, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 23, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before February 22,
2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $14,326.32** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 23, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
