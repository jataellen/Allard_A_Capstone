Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: SOL-24578-21
 



In the matter
of:


2300 UPPER JAMES
STREET MOUNT HOPE ON L0R1W0


 




Between:


George Tannourji


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Jessica
Entwistle Michael Angel


Tenants



 
George Tannourji (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jessica Entwistle and Michael Angel (the
'Tenants') because the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for the
purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 956 0593 7653# on
January 5, 2022. Only the Landlord attended the
hearing.
 
The Landlord
complained about the Board’s scheduling processes.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord
requested the last month rent, utilities, the application fee and insisted
on an order terminating the tenancy.
 
2.    
The Landlord
stated the Tenants
vacated the rental
unit. The Landlord’s application for an order evicting the Tenants is moot.
 
3.    
Since the application
was not accompanied by an affidavit signed by the Landlord nor was there proof that the Landlord
paid the Tenants
one month compensation, I am not satisfied the statutory requirements
of section 72 (1) and section 48.1 of the Act were met. As such costs and per
diem is denied
 
4.    
The Landlord’s request for utility
costs is not properly before me and was not considered.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
