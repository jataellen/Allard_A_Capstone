Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-20952-21-EX
 
In the matter
of:      3RD. FLOOR, 275 FRONT STREET
BELLEVILLE ON K8N2Z6
 
Between:                  Mazilu Development Inc.                                    Landlord
 
and
 
Harlavano Haye                                                                                                                    Tenant
 
 
On November
8, 2021, Mazilu
Development Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Harlavano Haye (the 'Tenant') and for an order
to have the Tenant pay the rent
and compensation for damage the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a
condition specified in the order issued by the Board on July 28, 2021 with
respect to application TEL-15466-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed to pay to the Landlord the full monthly rent due on November 1, 2021.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $6,186.00 for rent arrears, compensation for damage and the costs related to the Landlord's
application fee in Order TEL-15466-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $3,186.00 and that amount is included
in this order. As a result,
the previous order TEL-15466-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenant has
also failed to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from September
1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.
 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $2,000.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.




 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from October 1, 2020 to January 4, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TEL-15466-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 15, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$7,183.99*. This amount
represents the rent owing,
and the costs related to the application fee up to November 30, 2021, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $65.75
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting December 1, 2021 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
15, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 16, 2022 at .00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 16, 2022.
