Tenant




 


 
and


 




 


Marilayne Froment


Landlord



 
 
Andrea Smith
Rubino (the ‘Tenant)
applied for and order determining that Marilayne Froment
(the ‘Landlord) gave a notice of termination in bad faith.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 15, 2021.
 
The Tenant attended the hearing. The Landlord attended
the hearing along with his representative Nathan Serratore.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
On September
09, 2019 Landlord served
the Tenant a Notice of Termination (the ‘N12’)
claiming that the Landlord required possession of the rental unit for the
purposes of residential occupation.
 
2.    
In HOL-05725-19 Member Markell found that the Landlord required
possession of the unit
in good faith for the purposes of residential occupation. The tenancy was
terminated effective February 14, 2020. The Tenant moved out, one month prior
to the termination date, January 14, 2020.
 
3.    
The Tenant
claims in this applciation that the Landlord
did not occupy
the rental unit after
the tenancy terminated, and that the N12 was served in bad faith. The Tenant has no firsthand knowledge to
support her claim. She relies on the evidence of her witnesses.
 
Andrew Villamare
 
4.    
Andrew Villamare lived
at a neighbouring property until May 31, 2020. He smokes cigarettes outside his
house several times a day. He did not know the Landlord personally. He observed the Landlord at the property
only on weekends
doing yard work. Other than that, he states there
was no sign of life at the rental property.




 
Patricia Riley
 
5.    
Patricia Riley has
lived in the neighbourhood for over 13 years. As a result of the Covid- 19 pandemic
she has been working from home since March 2020. She
can see the rental property
from her home. She walks by rental property 4 times a day on her daily walks.
Patricia knows the Landlord personally. Occasionally they barbequed together.
 
6.    
After March 2020,
Patricia saw the Landlord sporadically at the rental property. She would notice
a black car in the driveway. She occasionally
saw the Landlord’s husband
doing yard work on the weekends.
 
7.    
In the summer of 2020, she noticed a lot of cars in driveway for baby shower.
In August 2020 she noticed
the Landlord around the property planting cedar hedges.
 
8.    
After the summer of 2020, Patricia did not see
any signs of life at the rental unit until
the spring of 2021. Patricia noticed
another neighbour’s car in the driveway
of the rental unit for a
four-week period in March and April 2021.
 
Landlord’s Evidence
 
9.    
After the Tenant moved out, the Landlord undertook
renovations to the property. After the
renovations were complete the Landlord moved in March 06,
2020. On May 06, 2020 the Landlord’s
husband received a new assignment from his employer Global Affairs Canada. This
required him to move to New York. The Landlord, was expecting a child at the
time, did not want to live alone and stayed with her parents. She would return
to the unit to maintain to tend to the yard work as needed.
 
10.  The Landlord’s child
was born in August 2020.
In the fall of 2020,
the Landlord traveled
to New York for several weeks to be with her spouse in New York. The Landlord and her spouse returned home
for Christmas. The Landlord left again to be with spouse in New York March 02,
2021. When the Landlord left, she allowed the neighbour to park her car in the
driveway while the Landlord was gone.
 
11.  The Landlord kept up with the yard work on
weekends. The Landlord provided bills showing that she, or her spouse, were
making utility, water, and internet payments.
The Landlord also provided
proof of purchase
that household items
were purchased for use at the residence.
 
12.  The Landlord was gone for long periods
of time to visit her spouse in New York.
When she was gone her parents kept care of the yard or the yard would go
unmaintained.
 
13. 
When the Landlord left again in the spring of 2021, she let her neighbour park her car in the driveway. This was a preventive
move to deter criminal activity.
 
14. 
On August
04, 2021 the Landlord’s maternity
leave ended. The Landlord arranged
for an assignment in New York
to be with her spouse. The Landlord sold the property.




 
Bad Faith
 
15.  Section 57(1)(b) of the of the Act
states:
 
The Board may make an order described in subsection (3) if, on application
by a former tenant of a rental unit, the Board determines that,
 
the landlord gave a notice
of termination under section 49 in bad faith, the former tenant vacated the rental unit as a result of the notice or as a result of an application to or order made
by the Board based on the notice, and no person referred
to in clause 49 (1) (a), (b), (c) or (d) or 49(2)(a)(b)(c) or
(d) occupied the rental unit within a reasonable time after the former tenant vacated the rental unit.
 
16.  This subsection sets out a three-part test which the Tenant must satisfy in order to be
successful in this application, namely:
 
•        
First, the N12
was served in bad faith;
•        
Second, Tenant
moved out of the unit as a result of the N12;
•        
Third, Landlord
did not occupy
the rental unit within a reasonable time after the former tenant vacated the rental
unit.
 
All three parts of the test must be met for the application to be successful.
 
17.  There is no dispute the Tenant moved out
because of being served the N12. I find the Tenant has satisfied the second part of the test.
The issues before me are parts one and
three of the test. For the reasons below, I find The Tenant, on a balance of
probabilities has not satisfied the first or third of the test needed for this
application to successful.
 
18.  It is undisputed that the Landlord
physically stayed at the former rental unit sporadically after January 15 2020. The Tenant submits this satisfies the elements
of third part of the test. I disagree. The Landlord
may have only stayed at the unit sporadically but occupied
the unit immediately after the former Tenant vacated.
 
19.  The Landlord’s evidence,
which I accept, was that she moved into the unit in March 2020. In my view, this is a reasonable
period from the date the tenancy terminated, which was February 14, 2020. I
also find the Landlord continually occupied the unit for a period of at least
one year after obtaining possession of the unit.
 
20.  The Tenant has not satisfied, on a balance
of probabilities, all elements of the test for bad faith set out in section 57(1)(b) of
the Act. It follows that the application must be dismissed.
 
Costs
 
21.  The Landlord’s representative made
requested $700 in costs if the Tenant’s application was unsuccessful. The LTB’s Interpretation Guideline 3:
Costs states that the Board should not use its power to order costs in a way to discourage landlord and tenants
from




 
exercising their statutory rights. It also makes it clear that aside from the application fee in
certain matters, costs are generally only awarded in cases involving
unreasonable or vexatious conduct.
 
22.  While the Tenant’s
application was unsuccessful, I find the Tenant did not act unreasonably or vexatiously, and thus
deny the request for costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The application is dismissed.
