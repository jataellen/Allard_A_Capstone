Harjit Mangat (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jason Snelgrove (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on December 20, 2021. Only the Landlord attended the hearing. As of 2:20 p.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant
has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from July 1, 2021 to
December 31, 2021. Because of the
arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 10,
2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on
December 16, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the
date the application was filed.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent was $930.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant
has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $790.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from August 1, 2010 to September 10, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of December
16, 2021, the date the Tenant returned
vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.

for the cost of filing
the application.

If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
