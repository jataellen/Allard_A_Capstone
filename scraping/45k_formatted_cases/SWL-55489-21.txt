Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number: SWL-55489-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
4, 2696 MEADOWBROOK LANE WINDSOR ON N8T2Y4


 




Between:


Starlight Canadian Residential Growth Fund


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Lukas Barker


Tenant



 
 
 
Starlight Canadian Residential Growth
Fund (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Lukas Barker (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 20, 2022. Only the Landlord’s representative, Sharon
Harris, attended the hearing. As of 11:00 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the
Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective January
23, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of
January 1, 2022, the monthly
rent for the unit is
$1,199.22.
 
4.    
The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,185.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021 to January 23, 2022.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the




File Number: SWL-55489-21
 
Tenant, and find that it would
be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 8, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4,657.79*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
28, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $39.43
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 29, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
8, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 9, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 8, 2022, then starting
February 9, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 9, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)    
$6,125.22 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022,
or
ii)     $7,324.44 if the payment is made on or before
February 8, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate
deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 9, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
