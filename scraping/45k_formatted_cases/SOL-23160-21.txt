Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-23160-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


UNIT 2 (MAIN), 672 QUAKER ROAD
W WELLAND ON L3C7J3


 




Between:


Nicole Ruoho
  Peter Ruoho


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


DJ Petrovsky Josh Burnett Kristine Halsted


Tenants



 
 
 
Nicole Ruoho
and Peter Ruoho (the 'Landlords') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict Kristine Halsted, DJ Petrovsky and Josh Burnett
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 22, 2022.
 
The Landlord, Nicole Ruoho,
the Tenant, Kristine
Halsted, and the Tenant's Legal Representative, Marilyn Obaseki (TDC
Niagara), attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants were in possession of the rental
unit on the date
the application was filed.
 
2.    
The Tenants have not paid the rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from
January 1, 2022 to February 12, 2022. This totals 43 days of unpaid rent.
 
3.    
The daily rent rate is $49.32
based on the lawful monthly
rent of $1,500.00.
 
4.     The amount of rent owing to the Landlords for the 43 day period totals $2,120.76.
 
5.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,500.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from October
16, 2020 to July 19, 2021
totals $1.14.




 
7.    
Due to the fact that the Tenants already
face eviction as a result
of a previous order
(SOL-24386-21), this order will be limited to costs only and not eviction.
 
8.     This order contains
all of the reasons in this matter
and no further reasons will be issued.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $619.62,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February 12, 2022, less the rent deposit
and interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
2.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for
the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing on or before March 8, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 9, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
