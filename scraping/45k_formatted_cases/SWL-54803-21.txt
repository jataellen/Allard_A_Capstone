Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-54803-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


202, 266 KINGSWOOD DRIVE KITCHENER ON N2E2K2


 




Between:


Centurion Property Associates Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Donghoon
Kim Jinhee Ha


Tenants



 
 
 
Centurion
Property Associates Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Donghoon
Kim and Jinhee Ha (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 20, 2021. The Landlord’s Agent,
Robert Forster and one of the Tenants, Donghoon Kim, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from June 1, 2021 to December
31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective September 29, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,538.11.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,470.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
1, 2021 to September 29, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenants paid $5,437.34 after the application was filed.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until January 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 31, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$2,629.37*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 7, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $50.57
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 8, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing*
on or before January 31, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 1,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022, then starting February
1, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 1, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 31, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $5,468.54** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
