Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-56524-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1757 LINCOLN ROAD WINDSOR ON N8W2P6


 




Between:


Lorie McCallum-Wilson


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Joshua
Chin


Tenant



 
 
Lorie
McCallum-Wilson (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Joshua Chin (the 'Tenant') because
the Landlord intends
to do major repairs or renovations to the
rental unit.
 
The hearing
was held by videoconference on December 20, 2021. The Landlord, Tenant and the Tenant’s representative, Justin Brodie
Tims-Fryer, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
On May 20, 2021 the
Landlord served the Tenant with an N13 Notice of Termination (N13) with a termination date of May 20, 2021. The N13 seeks termination of the tenancy because the Landlord intends to do major renovations in the kitchen
and the bathroom
of the rental unit.
 
2.    
The N13 was served
pursuant to s.50(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”),
which states that the date for termination specified in the notice shall be at
least 120 days after the notice is given and shall be
the day a period of tenancy ends, or where the tenancy is for a fixed term, the
end of the term.
 
3.    
The Landlord testified
that the date of termination in the N13 is listed as May 20, 2021; however, she noted that this is an error, and it should be September 20, 2021 – as listed in her L2 application to the Board.
 
4.    
As a result of this
error, the N13 does not comply with s.50(2) of the Act as the termination date of
May 20, 2021 is not at least 120
days after the N13 was served to the
Tenant on May 20, 2021. Therefore,
the N13 served to the Tenant is defective.
 
5.    
The Board
cannot issue an eviction order
without a valid notice of termination.
