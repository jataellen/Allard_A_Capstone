Act, 2006

In the matter
of:


125 GRAY STREET CHATHAM-KENT ON N7M1T3


 




Between:


Colin Stass


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Dana Walker


Tenant



 
Colin Stass (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dana Walker
(the 'Tenant') because
a)    
the Tenant, another occupant
of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential
complex has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises.; because
b)    
the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlord or another tenant; and because
c)     
the Tenant, another occupant
of the rental unit or a person
the Tenant permitted in the residential
complex has seriously impaired the safety of any person.
The Landlord has also applied for
an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage
and compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after
the termination date.
This application was heard via
video/teleconference on October
25, 2021.
The Landlord, the Landlord's Legal Representative Michael;
Stover and the Tenant attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application was originally for
termination of the tenancy based on a N5 and
a N7 notice of termination given to the Tenant
for wilful and negligent damage
to the rental unit and/or
residential complex.
2.    
A
hearing was held on August
9, 2021 and the parties
entered into a consent agreement for a non-remedial termination
of the tenancy effective October 31, 2021.
 
3.    
A determination was made at the
hearing on August 9, 2021, the claims in the Landlord’s application for damages pursuant
to section 89 of the Act were adjourned and is the basis
for this hearing.




 
4.     The Tenant was still in possession of the rental
unit as of the date the application was filed with the Board.
 
5.     Section 89 (1) of the Act provides, that a landlord
may apply to the Board for an order requiring a tenant to pay reasonable costs
that the landlord has incurred or will incur for the repair of or, where repairing is not reasonable, the replacement of damaged property, if the tenant, another occupant
of the rental unit or a person whom the tenant permits in the residential
complex wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to the rental unit or the
residential complex.
 
6.     On any application before the Board, the party making an allegation in an application has the onus of proving those allegations on a balance of probabilities.
 
7.     The standard of proof requires the party to show with
evidence that, “more likely than not”, their assertions are true and that evidence “must be sufficiently clear,
convincing and cogent to satisfy the balance of probabilities test.”
 
8.     With the application the Landlord submitted
a number of photographs
and quotations for the claimed damage that he incurred or will incur costs of
$14,012.00 to repair the damage and/or replace property that was damaged and
cannot be reasonably repaired.
 
9.     Prior to the hearing the Landlord submitted
an amended application for revised claim for
costs that they incurred or will incur has increased to $20,025.00 to repair
the damage and/or replace property that was damaged and cannot be reasonably
repaired.
 
10.  The Tenant disputes
the costs being claimed, alleging
that some of the repair work was completed by her. She provided
photographs taken within the rental unit, but did not provide any detailed
documents such as dates repair
work was completed and the cost she incurred to repair damage. Consequently, I am
unable to make a determination for any potential monetary offset from what the
Landlord is claiming.
 
11.  Equally, I was not satisfied by the added
documentation submitted by the Landlord relating to the amended application.
The Landlord provided no documentation from a contractor, for a revised
estimate or paid invoices, nor did the Landlord bring forth any contractor witness to give testimony.
Therefore, I deny the amended application.
 
12.  All in all, based on the totality
of the testimonies given and evidence that was submitted with the original application,
I was satisfied that the Tenant or an
occupant of the rental wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit and residential complex.
 
13.  I was also satisfied that the Landlord
has incurred or will incur initial
costs of $14,012.00 to repair the damage and/or
replace property that was damaged and cannot be reasonably repaired as was set
out in the original application filed with the Board.
 
14.  The order contains
all the reasons for the decisions within
the order. No other reasons will be issued.




 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$14,012.00 which represents the costs of repairing
the damage and/or replacing the damaged property.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
3.    
The Tenant shall pay the total amount owing**
to the Landlord on or before
February 28, 2022.
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before February
28, 2022, he will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
28, 2022, the Landlord has the right anytime after March 1, 2022 to
collect from the Tenant the amount owing or any outstanding balance as a result
of this order.
