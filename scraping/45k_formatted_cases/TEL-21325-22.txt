In the matter
of:


 
11, 1499 RITSON
ROAD S OSHAWA ON L1J3M3


 




Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Lindsay Shane


Tenant



 
 
 
On January 11, 2022,
Durham Regional Local Housing Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied
in this L4 application for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict Lindsay Shane (the 'Tenant') and for
an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the consent order issued by the Board
on November 10, 2021 with respect to L1 application TEL-17253-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The consent order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I find that the Tenant has not met
the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $250.00 arrears
on or before December 20, 2021. The Tenant did not pay $250.00 arrears on or before
January 7, 2022. The Tenant did not pay
$1082.00 rent on or before January
1, 2022. These were breaches
of paragraphs 2(a) of the
consent order. This L4 application was filed within 30 days of the breaches.
 
3.       
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order
required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$4,612.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
TEL-17253-21. The amount
that is still owing from that
order is $3,905.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order TEL-17253-21 is cancelled.




 
5.       
Since the date of the order,
the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from December 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.
 
6.       
There was no last month’s rent deposit collected.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The previous consent order
TEL-17253-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 4, 2022 (standard 11 days from the
issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
If the Tenant made any payments
to the Landlord after this L4 application was filed, those amounts shall be deducted from the
calculations below.
 
4.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4,987.00*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 31, 2022 and the costs
related to the application fee for the previous application.
 
5.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$17.79 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 1, 2022 to
the date the Tenant actually moves out of the rental unit or gets evicted.
 
6.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
4, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 5, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 4, 2022, then starting February
5, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 5, 2022.

The tenant has until
February 3, 2022 to file a motion
with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by February 3, 2022 the order will be
stayed and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on August
5, 2022 if the order has not been filed
on or before this date with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the
rental unit is located.
