In the matter
of:


RM 2, 57 WALNUT
STREET KITCHENER ON N2G1P7


 




Between:


Ann Tambur


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Oui Vongkham


Tenant



 
 
 
Ann Tambur
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Oui Vongkham
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or
someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or
negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the
unit after the termination date.
 
This
application was heard via videoconference on January 31, 2022. The Landlord and
the Landlord’s legal representative, T. Ellis, attended the hearing. As of
11:14 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     This application is about a first and second N5 Notice of Termination served
on the Tenant for substantial interference and damage. While I find
that the Landlord cannot rely on the second N5 Notice of Termination to
terminate the tenancy, the Landlord can rely on the first N5 notice that is
valid, was not voided and was filed within 30 days of the termination date. The
Landlord is also entitled to $500.00 in compensation for the damage.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s application was filed on October 21, 2021.
 
3.     The Landlord served
on the Tenant a first N5 Notice
of Termination on September 23, 2021
for substantial interference with the Landlord
and other tenants’
reasonable enjoyment and damages. It alleges that the Landlord
attended the unit and discovered that the Tenant written in black marker “Do
Not Enter” on the rental unit door and painted it brown. The Tenant also spray painted
the side of the house, mailbox
and the railing the colour of gold
without the Landlord’s consent. The amount to void for damages is $500.00. It also alleges that the Tenant and their guest made excessive noise, disrupting other tenants. The guest
also occupied the only bathroom for extended periods of time, limiting other
tenant’s access.




 
 
 
4.     The Landlord served on the Tenant a second N5 Notice
of Termination on October 21, 2021. It alleges that the Landlord the Tenant had
not paid the Landlord $500.00 to repair the damages to the door, siding,
mailbox and railing.
 
Law and Analysis
 
5.     Subsection 64(1) of the Act allows a landlord to serve a notice of termination on the tenant if the conduct of the tenant, an
occupant or guest substantially interferes with the reasonable enjoyment of the
residential complex or substantially interferes with another lawful right,
privilege or interest of the landlord or another tenant.
 
6.    
Based on the uncontested evidence
of the Landlord, I find that the Tenant substantially interfered with the
Landlord and other tenants’ reasonable enjoyment by damaging the rental unit, causing excessive noise, and limiting
the use of the only bathroom to the rental unit.
 
7.    
Subsection 62(1) of the Act allows a landlord
to serve on a tenant
a notice of termination if the
tenant, occupant or guest wilfully
or negligently caused
undue damage to the residential complex.
 
8.     Based on the uncontested evidence
of the Landlord, I also find that the Tenant,
an occupant or guest wilfully
caused undue damage to the residential complex. The writing on the Tenant’s
door persuades me that the Tenant wilfully caused the damage. Further, it was
uncontested that the Tenant spray painted the exterior of the unit. As such, I
am satisfied that the Tenant wilfully caused the damage.
 
9.     The Landlord served a second
N5 notice on the Tenant.
Subsection 68(1) of the Act states
that a Landlord may give a tenant a non-voidable N5 if there is an activity
takes place, conduct occurs or a situation arises more than seven days but less
than six months after the Landlord served the first N5 notice.
 
10.  The conduct set out in the second N5 Notice alleges
that the damages were still outstanding, and the Tenant had not paid the
Landlord the amount to repair the damage. As this damage is identical to the
damage claimed in the first N5, I do not find this to be another activity, conduct or a situation within the meaning
of subsection 68(1).
As such, the Landlord cannot terminate the tenancy
based on the second N5.
 
11.  However, subsection 64(3) states that the notice
of termination under subsection (1) is void if the tenant, within seven days
after receiving the notice, stops the conduct or activity or corrects the
omission. The evidence at the hearing was that the Tenant did not pay the
amount to void or offer to repair the damaged property within seven days after
the notice was served and had not as of the date of service
of the second N5. As such, I find that the
Tenant did not void the first N5 notice.




 
DAMAGES
 
12.  As found above, I find that the Tenant wilfully caused
undue damages to the rental unit. Subsection
89(1) allows for compensation to the Landlord
for reasonable costs to repair
or replace the damage. The Landlord testified that the pine door had to
be replaced and the spray paint had to be removed. This was done by a contractor on November 20, 2021 and the cost incurred was $500.00. I find
this amount to be reasonable in the circumstances.
 
SECTION 83 CONSIDERATIONS
 
13.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.]
 
14.  The Landlord disclosed that two tenants vacated as a result of this Tenant’s conduct. The
excessive noise is ongoing and on multiple
occasions, the Tenant
has set the fire alarm
off at 3:00 a.m. while cooking. On December 20, 2021, the Tenant’s guest
occupied the only bathroom for longer
than 45 minutes
and it was discovered she may have been using drugs
there. The Tenant did not attend the hearing to disclose any circumstances for
me to consider denying or delaying eviction. In consideration of the foregoing,
relief will not be granted.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of March 7, 2022. The
Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before March 7, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $500.00, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage
and/or replacing the damaged property.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before March 7, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe
interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 8, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before March 7, 2022,
then starting March 8, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction
may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March
8, 2022.
