In the matter
of:


3, 264 KING STREET WELLAND ON L3B3J8


 




Between:


Alicia Iter


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Lloyd Duncan Alicia
Nicholls


Tenant



 
 
 
Alicia Iter (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Lloyd Duncan
Alicia Nicholls (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 29, 2021 at 1:36 PM. The Landlord and the Tenant, Alicia
Nichols, attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
At the hearing of November 29,
2021, the Landlord advised that she was no longer the owner of the residential complex and therefore no
longer a landlord within the meaning of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006. For reasons further detailed in interim
order SOL- 16444-20-IN issued December
21, 2021, the matter was adjourned to permit the Landlord
to amend her application.
 
2.     The interim order contained the following order:
 
1.   
The matter is adjourned to permit the Landlord to amend her application to add
as a party to the application her successor in title to 264 King Street,
Welland, and to serve the amended application on such successor in title.
 
2.   
The Landlord shall file a copy of the amended application with the Board
along with a certificate of service not later than January 20, 2022. The Board may dismiss the application
without further notice if the Landlord does not comply with this requirement.
 
3.    
It is now more than a month after
January 20, 2022 and the Board’s file shows no record
of the Landlord complying with the interim order of December 21, 2021 to amend
her application and file it with the Board.




File Number: SOL-16444-20
 
4.    
The matter is accordingly
dismissed for the applicant no longer having standing as a Landlord, and having failed to amend the application in accordance with in interim
order SOL-16444-20-IN issued December 21, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
 
2.     The hearing scheduled
for March 4, 2022 is cancelled.
