Tenants



 
 
 
Jinyou Wan and Guohong
Zhang (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Shirley Ulian and Nick Ulian (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did
not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 13, 2022. The Landlord, Jinyou Wan,
and the Tenant, Shirley Ulian, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from March 1, 2021 to August 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a
Notice of Termination effective June 23, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on October
1, 2021. The Tenants were in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,700.00.
 
4.    
The Tenants have made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,700.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from August
31, 2019 to June 23, 2021.




File Number: SWL-52704-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of October
1, 2021, the date the Tenants gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlords $10,235.56*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to October 1, 2021, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before
February 1, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
February 2, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
