In the
  matter of:


UPPER, 29 BURR CRESCENT MARKHAM ON L3R9B8


 




Between:


Yi
  Zheng


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Cara Fu Shumei Fu


Tenants



 
 
 
Yi Zheng (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Shumei Fu and Cara Fu
(the 'Tenants') because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone
they permitted in the residential complex have wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the damage;
and because they, another occupant
of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex
have substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination
date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 964 1530 9097#
on October 14, 2021. The Landlord,
represented by Yun Tao Li, and the Tenants, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s notice mentioned
unpaid utility costs.
The Landlord chose not to pursue
this allegation.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s notice also identifies an issue on June 12, 2021 where the boyfriend
of the Tenant’s daughter threw
a cigarette into a flowerpot outside. The
Landlord claims there was a fire. There
have no incidents of this nature since.
 
3.     The Landlord complains
that the Tenants
complained about an issue with the refrigerator and that it wasn’t working. The Landlord claims she hired an
electrician and it cost her
$100.00 and the electrician simply plugged the refrigerator back in and it worked.
 
4.     Finally, the Landlord
alleges that the Tenants claim
there is a water leak and she paid
$200.00 for a plumber to look
into it when she was informed. The
notice says the plumber found there was garbage
blocking the pipe, and part of the water sealant
was




File Number: TNL-33533-21
 
taken away. No evidence
from the plumber
was submitted to support this claim. The Landlord also claims the shower is
dirty and messy.
 
5.     The Landlord called as a witness Michael Gao. Mr. Gao works for the plumber but has no certification in the field. However, Mr. Gao testified
that it was the improper
use of the shower that is causing a problem.
 
6.     Photographs show the shower has not been cleaned.
 
7.     The Tenants testified that the Landlord does not deal
with the issues in the unit properly. They have reported a leak in the ceiling
under the shower and the people the Landlord has brought in to look at the problem have not investigated what is causing
the leak. The Tenants have reported this problem five times since they moved into the unit in May 2020 and it has not been resolved.
 
8.     Considering the nature
of the allegations, the lack of supporting evidence and testimony, I find the Landlord has not established that the Tenants have
substantially interfered with the Landlord’s law rights and privileges. The witness was not the plumber who worked on the home and the cigarette butt in the flowerpot does not rise to the level of substantial
interference. The $300.00 claimed in
the application is not considered damage to the rental unit.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
