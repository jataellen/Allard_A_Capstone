Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-11539-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


111 PEDWELL STREET NEWCASTLE ON L1B0E1


 




Between:


Angai Vimalanathan


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Racheal O' Callaghan Randall Erwin
Patterson


Tenants



 
 
 
Angai
Vimalanathan (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Randall Erwin Patterson and Racheal O' Callaghan (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe (‘L1 Application’).
 
The Landlord also
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants because
they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the
residential complex have wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring
the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the damage.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date (‘L2 Application’).
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on October 5, 2021. Only the Landlord and the
Landlord’s legal representative, Allistair Trent, attended
the hearing. As of 10:34 a.m. the Tenants
were not present or represented although properly served with a notice of this
hearing by the Board.
 
The Landlord’s
legal representative informed the Board that one of the Tenants, Racheal O'
Callaghan (‘RC’), was in a different court
on another matter
on the day of the hearing. He advised
that the hearing was heard virtually and was finished
by 9:41 a.m. He also attempted to email this tenant
 
Determinations:
 
L1 Application
 
1.    
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from January 1, 2021 to October
31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective June 5, 2021.




 
2.    
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is
$1,850.00.
 
4.    
The Tenants
made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
attempted to negotiate
a payment agreement with the Tenants
on multiple occasions but was
unsuccessful.
 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,850.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from May 1, 2016 to
June 5, 2021.
 
L2 Application
 
Utility bills
 
8.    
Based on the Landlord’s
uncontradicted testimony I find that the Tenants failed to pay utility bills as
required by their tenancy agreement. The Landlord did not file any documentary evidence
in support of this part of his application but I found the Landlord’s testimony on this point to be
credible and reliable.
 
9.    
The Landlord
testified that the Tenants have not paid utility bills
since Summer of 2019
and that the outstanding amount of approximately $3,000 has now been added to
his property tax bill.
 
10.  The Landlord testified
that the most recent communication he had with the Tenants
about unpaid utility bills was two weeks prior to the hearing, at which
point RC advised the Landlord that she did not have money to pay the utility
bills.
 
Undue damage
 
11.  Based on the Landlord’s uncontested evidence I find that the Tenants willfully or negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit.
 
12.  The rental unit is a detached house
built in 2014. The Tenants
moved into the rental unit in April 2016. The Landlord’s
evidence was that at that time the rental unit was in very good condition.
 
13.  The Landlord attended at the rental unit with an inspector on July
6, 2019. The Landlord submitted photographic evidence as well as the inspector’s
report in support of his testimony that the Tenant willfully
or negligently caused
undue damage to the rental unit.
 
14.  
During his inspection of the rental
unit, the Landlord
noted the following damage:
 
a.   
Damaged/torn screen
door and net leading into the backyard;




 
b.   
3 broken
windows;
c.   
Damaged shutters
and window coverings throughout the house;
d.   
Holes in the drywall
throughout the house, only some of which
were patched up (poorly);
e.   
Flooring poorly
installed over existing
carpets in one of the rooms, and damaged
carpet throughout the house;
f.    
Improper painting,
paint stains, poor wallpaper, decals
and backsplash throughout the house that the Landlord
will have to remove or re-paint;
g.   
Damaged doors and door frames throughout the house; and
h.   
Hardwood floors
damaged by Tenants’
pets;
 
15.  I find that it is more likely than not that
the Tenants wilfully or negligently caused the damage as described by the
Landlord and that this damage is undue. I found the Landlord’s testimony to be
credible and reliable and it was supported by documentary evidence. The nature of the damage is beyond
normal wear and tear for a property
of this age.
 
16.  I find that the Tenants
did not void the Landlord’s notice of termination within the 7-day voiding period after receiving the
Notice of Termination N5 on or about May 21, 2021.
 
17.  The Landlord testified that he did not have
specific evidence about the state of the rental unit during the voiding period
because he was denied entry into the unit by the Tenants. He testified, however,
that the Tenants did not pay him any amount
towards repairing the damage and that he believes that the damage was never
repaired by the Tenants. Damaged windows that can be observed from outside remained
broken and the Landlord
is waiting for replacement windows he ordered to arrive. The Tenants did not
attend the hearing to provide any evidence about repairing or replacing any of
the damaged items. The Tenants have not paid any rent or utility bills for a
long period of time. I find that it is more likely than not that the Tenants
did not repair or replace the damaged items during the 7-day voiding period.
 
18.  I find that the Landlord
will incur costs
of $11,000.00 to repair the damage
and/or replace property that was
damaged and cannot be reasonably repaired.
 
19.  The Landlord’s evidence
was that the reasonable cost of repairing
the damage would be
$15,230.00. This was based on an informal quote given by a contractor and includes
$6,000 for
repainting the entire house. While I find that some of the damage caused by the
Tenants will require the Landlord to paint some of the walls, I do not find
that the Landlord established that the entire house will need to be re-painted
due to damage caused by the Tenants. I therefore reduce the amount claimed by
the Landlord that corresponds to this item in the quote
provided by the Landlord. I find the rest of the quote to be reasonable.
 
No relief from eviction
 
20. 
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Landlord opposed any




 
relief from eviction and requested a non-voidable order for eviction. The
Tenants did not attend the hearing
to request relief.
I will grant the Landlord’s request in light of the large
amount of rent owing, unpaid utilities, and extensive nature of the damaged
caused by the Tenants.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 18, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$20,004.06*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 7, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $60.82
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 8, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$11,000.00, which represents the reasonable costs
of repairing the damage and/or replacing the damaged property.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before January 18, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 19,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January
19, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 19, 2022.
