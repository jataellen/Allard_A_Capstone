Between:


Marie Graham Bill Hartung Laverne Hartung Debbie Marshall


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


 


Tenant




 


Jason Phillip Hartung


 



 
 
 
 
Marie Graham, Bill Hartung, Laverne
Hartung and Debbie
Marshall (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Jason Phillip Hartung (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 14, 2021. The Landlord, Bill Hartung,
the Landlord's Legal Representative, Kelly Draycott, the Tenant and the
Tenant's Legal Representative, Carmen Sa’d, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Does the Act Apply?
 
1.    
The Tenant testified that he moved into the rental unit, a home owned by his parents,
after his divorce 10 to 12 years ago. At that time, he was obliged to
pay the rent whenever he could, with no set amount.
His father, Laverne Hartung (LH), was the sole Landlord at the time. His siblings have since then become part owners of
the rental home.
 
2.    
The Tenant
further testified that he paid $1,000.00 each month whenever
he could and had
an intention of buying the home. The Tenant subsequently arranged with his mother to buy
the home and or inherit
it. Following the passing of his mother,
she bequeathed to him
$150,000.00 with which he could pay for the purchase of the rental
unit. A copy of his mother’s Last Will and Testament (will) was presented as
evidence.
 
3.    
Following discussions
with his father, LH, he paid directly to LH $2,000.00 on September 29, 2019 towards the purchase of the
rental home. From September
2019 to March 2020,




 
the Tenant paid $1,000.00 in rent each month. For Christmas 2019, his expected
Christmas present of $5,000.00 was not given to him by LH but was instead applied
towards payment for the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
further testified that he did not pay the rent from March 2020 due to the impact
of the pandemic on his employment and LH was considerate of his predicament. In December 2020, the Tenant entered an
Agreement of Purchase and Sale with LH for the purchase of the unit, and a copy
of the agreement was presented as evidence at the hearing. The validity of the
Agreement of Purchase and Sale is in question and the sale was not closed for
various reasons. This is an issue that is not within the scope of my decision
in this matter and will not be considered.
 
5.    
The Tenant denied
receiving a tenancy agreement when he initially moved into the rental unit stating
that he was unaware of the existence
of the agreement which was provided by the Landlords. The Tenant admitted that the portions of his
mother’s diary, also provided as evidence by the Landlords, were accurate
with regards to the amounts he paid for
rent and the dates on which the payments were made.
 
6.    
The Tenant denied that
his payments were made in accordance with the tenancy agreement which showed
that the monthly rent was $1,000.00.
 
Analysis
 
7.    
The issue to be
determined here is whether the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 applies to the
relationship between the parties.
 
Application of Act
 
3 (1) This Act applies with respect to rental units in residential
complexes, despite any other Act and despite any agreement or waiver to the
contrary.
 
Board’s jurisdiction
 
168. (2) The
Board has exclusive jurisdiction to determine all applications under this Act
and with respect to all matters in which jurisdiction is conferred on it by
this Act.
 
8.    
In arriving at a
decision on whether the Act applies in this circumstance, I must consider
section 202 of the Act which specifically states that the Board shall ascertain
the real substance of all transactions and activities relating
to a residential complex or a rental
unit and the good faith of the participants and in doing so, may disregard the outward form of a transaction or the separate
corporate existence of participants; and may have regard to the
pattern of activities relating to the residential complex or the rental unit.
 
9.    
In ascertaining the
real substance of the transactions and activities between the parties with
regards to the unit in question, I find that there is a Landlord and Tenant
relationship and as a result, the Act applies with respect to the rental unit.
The following definitions found in section 2 of the Act are instructive here:




 
“tenant” includes a person who pays rent in return for the right to occupy a rental unit and
includes the tenant’s heirs, assigns and personal representatives …”
 
“rent” includes the amount of any consideration paid or given or
required to be paid or given by or
on behalf of a tenant to a landlord or the landlord’s agent for the right to
occupy a rental unit and for any services
and facilities and any privilege, accommodation or thing that the landlord provides for the tenant in respect of the
occupancy of the rental unit, whether or not a separate charge is made for
services and facilities or for the privilege, accommodation …”
 
“tenancy agreement” means
a written, oral or implied agreement between a tenant and a landlord for
occupancy of a rental unit and includes a licence to occupy a rental unit”.
 
10.  Based on all the evidence, at the
commencement of the tenancy, the parties agreed that the Tenant would pay to the Landlords $1,000.00
each month and even though
the Tenant may not have been consistent with the
payments, that did not negate the agreement. The Tenant was not candid in his
statements that the $2,000.00 payment he made in September 2019, was for the purchase
of the rental home, given his testimony
that he was required to pay the rent whenever
he could. No evidence was provided to support his claim
that the $2,000.00 payment was made for the purchase of the rental home. I find
that this payment and the subsequent payments of $1,000.00 each month were rent
payments.
 
11.  The Tenant’s anticipated Christmas gift of $5,000.00 was applied to past
rental payments and I find this consistent with page 8 of the tenancy
agreement, which although unsigned stated that the Landlord will accept rent and partial
rent when available
from the Tenant
but unpaid rent will be carried over as an ongoing debt.
 
12.  Although
the Tenant denies
ever seeing a copy of the tenancy
agreement provided by the Landlord, I am satisfied that a tenancy
was created and did not have to be in writing to be considered valid.
 
13.  Overall,
I did not find the Tenant credible
and his claim that he was bequeathed
$150,000.00 by his mother
was a clear falsehood as evidenced by his mother’s
will, dated February 27, 2008,
which states categorically on page 5 “I acknowledge that JASON PHILLIP
HARTUNG is indebted to me in the amount of ONE HUNDRED & FIFTY
THOUSAND DOLLARS ($150,000.00). This amount or whatever amount should be
outstanding at the date of my death is not to be forgiven
and is to be reflected
as an asset of my estate and addressed accordingly”.
 
The L1
Application
 
14.  The Tenant has not paid the total rent the
Tenant was required to pay for the period from February 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Because of the arrears,
the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective September 2, 2021.
 
15.  The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit.
 
16.  The lawful monthly
rent is $1,000.00.
 
17.  The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.




 
18.  The Tenant testified that he is currently employed
and earns approximately $6,000.00 each month. The Tenant intends
to pay the outstanding amount
by borrowing and requested
an opportunity to continue
the tenancy by paying
an additional $1,000.00 towards the arrears
each month. Considering the Tenant’s failure to pay any rent since February
2020, I am not satisfied that he will comply with a conditional order.
 
19.  The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
20.  I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would not be unfair to postpone
the eviction until January 26, 2022
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant is
terminated. The Tenant must move out
of the rental unit on or before January 26, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlords $23,142.87*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 4, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords
$32.88 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 5, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before January 26, 2022, the
Tenant will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 27, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 26, 2022, then starting January 27, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after
January 27, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 26, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $24,186.00** to the Landlords
or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time,
the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after
January 27, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The
Tenant is




 
only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlords.
