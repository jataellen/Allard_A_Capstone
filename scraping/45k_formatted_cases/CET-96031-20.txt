In the matter
of:

Between:


Tara Clement


Tenant




 


 
and


 




 


24739595 Ontario Inc Hardeep Saini


Landlords



 
 
 
Tara Clement (the 'Tenant')
applied for an order determining that Hardeep Saini and 24739595 Ontario Inc
(the 'Landlords') harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with
the Tenant and substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenant or by a
member of the Tenant's household. The Tenant also applied for an order
determining that the Landlords gave a notice of termination in bad faith.
 
This application was heard by video conference
on November 25, 2021.
 
The Tenant’s daughter, Selena
Clement attended on behalf of the Tenant. The Landlord’s representative Shalini
Puri appeared along
with the Landlord, Hardeep Saini. The Tenant
was not present at the
hearing and was not available to give evidence in support of the application.
 
 
Determinations:
 
Preliminary Issue –
T5 Application – Notice of Termination Given in Bad Faith
 
1.    
The Tenant
did not establish that the Landlords gave an N12 notice
of termination under section 48 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act”) in bad faith.
 
2.     The Landlords did not give an N12 notice to the Tenant.
 
3.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit as a result of their own notice to the Landlords.
 
4.     Subsection 57(1)(a) of the Act states:
 
The Board
may make an order described
in subsection (3) if, on application by a former tenant of a rental unit, the Board
determines that,




 
(a) the landlord gave a notice of termination under section 48 in
bad faith, the former tenant vacated the rental unit as a result of the notice or as a result
of an application to or order made by the Board based on the
notice, and no person referred to in
clause 48 (1) (a), (b), (c) or (d)
occupied the rental unit within
a reasonable time after the former tenant vacated the rental unit;
 
5.     Subsection 57(1) (a) of the Act sets out the
three-part test and the Tenants must establish
all three of the requirements. The first part is that the Landlord
gave a notice of termination
under section 48 of the Act (N12
notice) in bad faith. The second part is that the Tenants vacated the
rental unit as a result of the N12 notice or a Board order based
on the N12 notice. The third part is that the Landlord did not move into the
rental unit within a reasonable time after the Tenants vacated.
 
6.    
The Tenant’s
daughter gave further
submissions about the Landlord’s intention
to sell the unit but no evidence was filed with the Board, no details
were included in the Tenant’s application and the submissions to the Board did
not provide further details that would assist the Board in continuing with the
application.
 
7.     As such,
the Tenant’s application pursuant to s. 57(1)(b)
is dismissed.
 
Preliminary Issue –
T2 Application
 
8.    
At the outset of the hearing,
the Landlord’s legal
representative raised a preliminary
issue regarding whether the Tenant’s application contains sufficient details to
enable the Landlords to properly prepare a response.
 
9.     On its face, the T2 application does not articulate
how the Landlord’s conduct substantially interfered with her reasonable enjoyment or how the Landlords threatened, coerced harassed or
interfered with the Tenant.
 
10.  In paragraph 1 of the Tenant’s details
it indicates that the Tenant agreed
to move out as follows:
 
In
January 2020, my landlord verbally told me that I had to vacate my unit because
he was planning on selling it. I did not want to leave my unit but based on what my landlord told me, I believed an eviction
for purchaser’s own use was inevitable so I agreed to move out.
(Emphasis added)
 
11.  The application
further indicates that on April 26th, 2020, the Tenant had sent an e-mail
to the Landlords asking them if they wanted her to leave the unit by
June 2020. The Landlords responded 2 days later advising that this was the
case, but no details are provided as to why.
 
12.  According to the Ontario Divisional Court’s decisions
in both Kuzyk v. S.K. Properties (November 22, 2001) and Ball v. Metro Capital
Property and Lockhurst (December 19, 2002), if a Notice of Termination issued
by a landlord is confusing to the degree that a reasonable person could not understand the precise actions
or omissions that caused the landlord to pursue eviction, a Member
would find it defective. I find that this reasoning




 
would apply equally to applications brought
by Tenants. I say this because the underlying
legal principle here is that the parties
are entitled to know the case they have to meet and they are entitled to know how they
ought to prepare an effective response.
 
13.  We find that there are insufficient details in the
Tenant’s application to support any
of the prohibited conduct as detailed under s. 29 of the Act and as
such, the Landlords could not possibly know the case to be met before the Board and could not prepare
an effective response. As the
Tenant’s application does not meet the requirements of the law, it must also be
dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
14.  The Tenant's applications are dismissed.
