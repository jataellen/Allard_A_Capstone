Tenants




 
 
 
Orillia Community Non-profit
Housing Corp. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Damion Hiles, Rose Hiles and Amanda Hiles (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have
the Tenants pay the
rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on October 25, 2021 with respect to
application CEL-01577-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenants have not met the following
conditions specified in the order:
The Tenants failed to pay $2,000.00 towards the arrears, on or before
November 5, 2021. The Tenants to pay $850.00 towards the arrears, on or before
November 19, 2021.
 
3.       
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenants were ordered
to pay $5,321.00 for rent arrears in Order CEL-01577-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $4,471.00 and
that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order
CEL-01577-21 is cancelled.

1.       
Order CEL-01577-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 21, 2022.
 
3.       
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $5,972.40*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 10, 2022.
 
4.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$38.14 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting January 11, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.

owing* on or before January
21, 2022, the Tenants will
start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 21, 2022, then starting January

eviction may be enforced.

8.

Board to set aside the order under s. 78(9)
of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January
20, 2022 the order will be
stayed, and the Board will schedule a hearing.
 
 
9.       
In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on July 22,
2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
