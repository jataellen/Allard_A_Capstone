Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-21216-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


372 WOOLWICH STREET GUELPH ON N1H3W6


 




Between:


Samantha Thomson


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


James Hammill Michelle Hammill


Tenants



 
 
Samantha Thomson (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict James Hammill
and Michelle Hammill
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on September 7, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord’s agent George Thomson
and the Landlord’s legal representative attended the hearing.
 
The Tenants were not present or represented at any time during the hearing block although
properly served with notice of the hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from October 1, 2020 to September
30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective April 9, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession
of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful monthly rent is $3,300.00.
 
4.    
The Tenants in substance
paid $3,300.00 after
the application was filed.
This payment is in fact a waiver of one month’s rent to satisfy the
requirement to pay compensation in relation to an N12 Notice of Termination
given to the Tenants.
 
5.     The Landlords also waived $3,615.00
of the rent arrears. As the Landlords
explained this, the Landlord
wanted to give the Tenants credit for renovations completed by the Tenant in
the rental unit and because the Landlords stopped the provision of television
and internet services in the rental unit.




 
6.    
The Landlord is not holding a rent deposit.
 
7.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
8.     In particular, the Landlord was not aware of any circumstances of the
Tenants that would favour relief
from or postponement of eviction and the Tenants were not present to provide
evidence on this issue. Additionally, the Landlord’s legal representative
advised me that the parties had agreed to terminate the tenancy effective
September 30, 2021 in another Landlord application. After reviewing the Board’s
record, I have confirmed that the parties did in
fact reach such an agreement and this agreement is confirmed in Board
order SOL-23016-21 issued
on September 10, 2021. In these circumstances, it would not be appropriate to grant relief from
eviction.
 
9.    
I
have no confirmation that the Tenants
did in fact vacate the rental unit on September 30, 2021. The result is that I
have calculated the arrears and daily compensation to September 30, 2021, but provided for an amount of daily compensation if the Tenants have
not vacated.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
September 30, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to
the Landlord $31,762.26*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to September 30, 2021 and less the amounts waived
by the Landlords.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $108.49
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting October 1, 2021
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before
February 15, 2022, the Tenants will
start to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from February 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
September 30, 2021,
then starting October
1, 2021, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after October 1, 2021.
 
8.     If, on or before September 30, 2021, the Tenants pay the amount
of $32,871.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust,
this order for eviction will be void. This means that the




 
tenancy would not be terminated
and the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that
the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after
October 1, 2021 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
