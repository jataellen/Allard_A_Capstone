David Chinumezi Womeoda Azubaike Robert Stockdale

Tenants



 
 
 
Executive
Properties Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Ubong Akwaowo Expo, Robert Stockdale and David Chinumezi Womeoda
Azubaike (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants
pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed to
meet a condition specified in the order
issued by the Board on August
24, 2021 with respect to application SOL-22275-21.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved
by order SOL-25264-21, issued on November
4, 2021. The Tenants filed a
motion to set aside order SOL-25264-21.
 
This motion was heard by videoconference on January 6, 2022.
The Landlord and the third-named Tenant attended the hearing.
Determinations:
1.   
The first
issue before the Board is whether the Tenant breached
order SOL-22275-21 as alleged by the Landlord. The Tenant agrees that he breached.
Specifically, he failed to pay the arrears of
$1,650.00 on or before
September 17, 2021 and failed to pay the rent for October on or before October
1, 2021.
 
2.   
The second
issue is whether
the Board is satisfied, having
regard to all the circumstances, that it would not be
unfair to set aside the eviction order. (See: s. 78(11)(b) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').)
 
3.   
This tenancy
began approximately four years ago. The monthly
rent is $1,650.00 and is due on the first of each month.




 
4.   
The Tenant explains
that he breached the order because his roommate moved out and because he was
unable to keep his warehouse job and study in the PSW program at the same time.
In essence, the household income
decreased resulting in the breach,
however, the Tenant did make small payments when he could.
 
5.   
In November 2021, the
Tenants got a new roommate who has been contributing to the household expenses.
Further, the Tenant testified that he has now graduated
and obtained full-time
employment, earning more. The other Tenants have also had an increase in their income.
 
6.   
As such,
the Tenants want a chance to preserve
their tenancy and propose an aggressive
repayment plan whereby they would pay their rent on time and $2,500.00 on the
17th of each month for the next
seven months until the balance is paid in full.
 
7.   
On cross-examination, the Tenant confirmed
that no payments
were made to the Landlord since the breach and aside from
the August 27, 2021 payment, the payment plan was not adhered to. The Tenant
also confirmed he understood the consequences of breaching the repayment plan at the last hearing.
 
8.   
The Landlord opposes
the Tenant ’s motion and states that the Tenant entered into this mediated
agreement in August 2021, when the arrears were $11,381.86. Since the breach,
the arrears have accrued to $15,481.00. The Landlord takes the position that
the Tenants cannot afford
the rental unit and seeks the motion
be denied and the stay be lifted immediately.
 
ANALYSIS
 
9.   
The Board’s
expectation is that payment plans
that are consented
to will be complied with by the parties. The purpose of
subsection 78(11)(b) is provide for the possibility of relief from eviction
where there has been a breach of an order but there are extenuating
circumstances to consider. The Board is usually interested in knowing whether
or not the breach was unavoidable, or a result of events beyond the tenant’s
control. It is also interested in whether or not the tenancy is viable as there
is no point in continuing a tenancy where future breaches are inevitable.
 
10. Based on the evidence before the
Board, I find that the Tenant breached the repayment plan due to circumstances beyond their control,
namely, a reduction
in their income
due to their roommate leaving
and the job loss.
 
11. Given the Tenants’ financial circumstances
are improving substantially and the repayment plan proposed is aggressive in
nature, I find it appropriate under the circumstances to grant the Tenants
relief by allowing them a final opportunity to preserve their tenancy
and repay the debt owed the Landlord.
 
12. The
motion to set aside the order is granted and replaced with the repayment
plan proposed by the Tenants.




 
13. This
order contains all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The motion
to set aside order SOL-25264-21, issued on November
4, 2021 is granted.
 
2.    
Order SOL-22275-21 is cancelled and replaced with the following order.

and costs owing

5.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord the lawful monthly
rent as it comes due in full and no later than the first day of
every month commencing February 2022 to July 2022.
 
6.     If the Tenants fail to
make any one of the payments in accordance with this order, the Landlord may,
without notice to the Tenants and within 30 days of the breach, apply to the
Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenants
and requiring that the Tenants
pay any new arrears, NSF fees and related charges that became owing
after January 31, 2022.
