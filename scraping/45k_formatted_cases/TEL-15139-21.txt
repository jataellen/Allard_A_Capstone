In the matter
of:


MAIN FLOOR, 195
RITSON ROAD SOUTH OSHAWA ON L1H5H6


 




Between:


Angela Davis


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Sally
Gamache


Tenant



 
 
 
Angela Davis
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sally
Gamache (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. (L1 application)
 
The Landlord
also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant because the Tenant,
another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the
residential complex has wilfully
or negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also
applied for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the
damage; and because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered
with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlord or another tenant. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit
after the termination date. (L2
application)
 
These L1 and L2 applications were heard by videoconference over two hearings,
the first on June
8, 2021 and the second on October 19, 2021.
 
For the June 8,
2021 hearing, the Landlord, the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Wendy Burgess, and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
The parties attempted mediation prior to the
commencement of this merits hearing.
 
For the October 19, 2021 hearing,
the Landlord and the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Wendy Burgess, attended the hearing. As of 9:23 am, the Tenant was not present
or represented and the hearing was commenced at that time.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
At the June 8, 2021 hearing,
the Landlord led seven exhibits
into the record as part of her evidence in chief submissions for the
L2 application, namely:
•        
LL#1:- March 5, 2021 photos of garbage outside
a rental unit door;
•        
LL#2:- May 20, 2021 video clip involving the Tenant’s father;




 
•        
LL#3:- photo
of indoor electrical cord used outside
in the March 8-April 29,2021 timeframe;
•        
LL#4:- April
29, 2021 video
clip – running of hose for 24 hours;
•        
LL#5:- February
1, 2021 text from the Tenant calling
the Landlord a ‘c        ’;
•        
LL#6:- March 4, 2021 text messages
– Tenant threatens to damage house
and cancel ODSP;
•        
LL#7:- Video clip in which a racial slur is said.
 
2.    
At both the June 8, 2021 and October
19, 2021 hearings, the Landlord submitted an Update form, which provided an accounting of rents paid and
still owing.
 
3.    
At the October 19,
2021, the Landlord led an eighth exhibit that had been received but not clearly
scanned into the Board’s records. I
requested a better copy of that exhibit post-hearing, and I confirm the
Landlord submitted exhibit LL#8 on October 19, 2021, which evidences
the payment by the Landlord
of $88.14 for the damaged
lock that had to
be repaired.
 
4.    
During the June 8, 2021
hearing, the Tenant contested the rent arrears claim made by the Landlord in
the L1 application. The Tenant
testified she has used another tenant’s computer to make her rent payments and
can produce proof that she has paid more rent that is shown in the Landlord’s
claim. For the L2 application, the
Landlord testified concerning the various claims made, for example the garbage
strewn outside the rental unit, the verbal insults made by the Tenant, the
broken lock and the running of an indoor electrical cable outside. The Tenant contested the claims in the L2
application, for example by stating she paid $400.00 to have the garbage taken
away, she repaired the lock that she inadvertently broke and there was no wrongdoing in respect of the electrical
cable used for the outdoor children’s inflatable bouncer. The Tenant countered by testifying that she has been substantially interfered with by the Landlord,
for example with someone calling the Children’s Aid
Society on six occasions against the Tenant.
The Landlord disagreed with the Tenant about the broken lock, stating
that the Landlord had to go to Home Depot to buy a new lock mechanism, which
the Landlord had installed.
 
5.    
The June 8, 2021 hearing was adjourned due to time constraints in that hearing
block. I directed the parties orally that they were to submit any additional proof
they may want to
rely upon for the L1 application in particular (i.e. the Tenant said she could
provide evidence of additional rent payments) and as well, for the L2
application.
 
6.    
At the October 19, 2021
hearing, the Landlord submitted that the Tenant moved out of the rental
unit on July 1, 2021. She indicated she was satisfied
that she regained
vacant possession on that date.
 
7.    
Consequently, the
Landlord requested that the L1
application be amended so that only a rent arrears order would result (i.e. no
order for eviction), and that the L2 application be limited/narrowed to just the claim for the undue damage (replacement lock cost), deleting the claim for substantial
interference.




 
8.     Based on the new information about the Tenant
moving out on July 1, 2021, I consented
to narrowing both the L1 and L2 applications, as this represented little to no
prejudice to the Tenant, who did not attend the October 19th hearing.
 
9.    
As well, I note that the Tenant made no submissions after the June 8, 2021 to the Board,
so that in effect, the evidence submitted by the Landlord at the June 8th hearing was challenged but not rebutted by the Tenant
successfully in any way.
 
L1 Application
 
10.  The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
January 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination (N4) effective
January 25, 2021.
 
11.  The monthly rent is
$3,000.00.
 
12.  The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $3,000.00
from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
13.  Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from October 29, 2020 to January 25, 2021.
 
14.  The Tenant paid $8,500.00 after the application was filed.
 
15.  The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on July 1, 2021. The Board consented to narrowing
the L1 application to an order for arrears only (i.e. no eviction).
 
L2 Application
 
16.  The N5 notice claims “substantial
interference with the Landlord’s or another tenant’s reasonable enjoyment
and/or lawful rights, privileges or interest” under section 64 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’), and “wilful or negligent damage” in the
amount of $88.14 under section 62 of the Act.
The L2 application also contains a claim for undue damage under section
89 of the Act in the same amount of $88.14. This claim for undue damage is made to complement the claim for the same damage claimed
under the N5 notice.
 
17.  The L2 application was narrowed by consent of the Board at the October 19, 2021
hearing to delete the claim of substantial interference.
 
18.  Based on the submissions and evidence of the parties,
I find on a balance
of probabilities that the
Tenant wilfully or negligently damaged the rental unit as set out in the N5
notice. The Tenant did not pay the Landlord the $88.14 claimed under the N5
notice (exhibit LL#8 which evidences the Landlord paid this amount to repair the
lock), so I find as well that the Tenant did not void the N5 notice. However, since the Tenants vacated the
rental unit on July 1, 2021 (per the L1 application), there is no need to
consider circumstances or anything further in respect of relief from eviction.




 
19.  Finally,
for completion of the claims
under the application, I also find that the Landlord’s
claim under section 89 of the Act is successful, and will order the damage
under that claim to be paid by the Tenant to the Landlord.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated as of July 1, 2021 when the Tenant gave vacant possession of
the rental unit back to the Landlord.
 
L1 Application
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $4,749.93*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to July 1, 2021 (when the Tenant moved out), less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord
owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
L2 Application
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $88.14,
which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the undue damage or
replacing the damaged property in the rental unit.
 
L1 and L2 Applications
 
5.    
The full amount owing by the Tenant
to the Landlord under the L1 and L2 applications, including the application
filing cost, is $5,039.07.
 
6.    
If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before January 31, 2022, the Tenant will start to
owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
