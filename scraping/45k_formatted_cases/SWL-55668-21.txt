Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55668-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


306, 3580 SEMINOLE STREET WINDSOR ON N8Y1Y2


 




Between:


Meddco Properties Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Vanessa Antonio


Tenant



 
 
 
Meddco Properties Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy
and evict Vanessa Antonio
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard by videoconference on January 20, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s Legal Representative, Jessica Lapkowski, attended the hearing.
As of 10:30 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 25, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent for the unit is $944.56.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $895.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from October 1, 2019 to
January 25, 2022.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $1,900.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on
the parties and whether the Landlords attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with




File Number: SWL-55668-21
 
the Tenant, and find that it would not be unfair
to postpone the eviction until February 28, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,786.86*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
28, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$31.05 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 29, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 28, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)           
$2,963.56 if the payment is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)          
$3,908.12 if the payment is made on or before
February 28, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if the Tenant pays the amount
required under that subsection on or after March 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make
this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
