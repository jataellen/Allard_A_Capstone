Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-41998-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


716, 1140
RAMSEY VIEW COURT SUDBURY ON P3E2E3


 




Between:


Butera Investments Inc.


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Ambur Morgan
  Gail Benoit Yannick Benoit


Tenants



 
Butera Investments Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Yannick Benoit,
Ambur Morgan and Gail Benoit
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 27, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Jennifer
Ricci and the Landlord’s Agent,
Lauren Brace, attended
the hearing. As of 1:37 p.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from December 1, 2020 to January
31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective December 21, 2020.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,799.00.
 
4.     The application is amended to correct the spelling of the Tenant
from Amber Morgan to
Ambur Morgan.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,799.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from October 5, 2020 to
December 21, 2020.
 
7.    
The Tenants paid $2,550.00 after the application was filed.




 
8.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenants, and find
that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 15, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $21,085.10*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to
February 4, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$59.15 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 5, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
15, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 16, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 15, 2022, then starting February
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 16, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 15, 2022, the Tenants pay
the amount of $24,585.01** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 16, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
