Between:

and


 




 


Thorold Palsson


Tenant



 
 
Review Order
 
Cascade Apartments (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Thorold Palsson
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved by order EAL-96523-21 issued on November
2, 2021. On November 3, 2021,
the Tenant requested a review of the order.
The request was heard by videoconference on January 21, 2022.
 
Determinations:
 
Review
 
1.     Prior to the hearing the Landlord’s representative
sent the Tenant an email with the subject line “RE: EAL-97232-21 NOTICE
OF HEARING – NOVEMBER 24 2021”. This
was a reference to a file for an unrelated matter
and appears to have
been sent to the Tenant in
error. At the review hearing the Tenant testified that when he received this
email on September 24, 2021 he thought the hearing for this matter, scheduled
for October 12, 2021, had been rescheduled and so he did not attend the hearing
on October 12, 2021.
 
2.     Based on the Tenant’s uncontested evidence, I find,
on a balance of probabilities, that the Tenant was
not reasonably able to participate in the proceedings.
 
3.     At the hearing
I granted the Tenant’s request
for a review and the Landlord’s L1 application was heard de novo.
 
L1 application




File Number: EAL-96523-21-RV
 
4.    
Since the Landlord did not appear at the hearing to support the application, I find that this
application has been abandoned.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order EAL-96523-21 issued
on November 1, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the
following:
 
2.     The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
