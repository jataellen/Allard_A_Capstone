Order under Section 31
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TET-16999-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1 BDRM BASEMENT, 45 DOMINY DRIVE WHITBY ON L1T3B9


 




Between:


Kimberly Hoven Marcus Williams


Tenants




 


 
and


 




 


Alex Ghandour


Landlord



 
 
 
Kimberly Hoven and Marcus
Williams (the 'Tenants') applied for an order determining that Alex Ghandour
(the 'Landlord') harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with
them, altered the locking system on a door giving entry to the rental unit or
residential complex without giving them replacement keys, substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental
unit or residential complex by the Tenants or by a member of their household
and withheld or deliberately interfered with the reasonable supply of a vital
service, care service, or food that the Landlord is obligated to supply under
the tenancy agreement.
 
The hearing was held by videoconference on January 27, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Dan Schofield, attended
the hearing. As of 1:36
p.m., the Tenants were not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     Since the Tenants
did not appear
at the hearing to support
their application, I find that this
application has been abandoned.
 
2.     It should be noted that this matter
was originally scheduled
to be heard in VC135 at the same today but was changed to VC145
due to a conflict with the original presiding member; the member was present in
VC135 to give the parties the new sign-in information for this room. This
matter was stood down until 1:39 before proceeding as uncontested, in the event
the Tenant had difficulties with signing in.
 
3.     It should also be noted that an Interim Order was
issued on September 22, 2022 that found the Tenant’s
application lacked sufficient details for the Landlord to know the case
to meet; the Tenants were ordered to amend the application no later than
October 27,




File Number: TET-16999-21
 
2021, and to provide
the Landlord ad the Board a copy of the amendment; neither
the Board not the Landlord received an amendment.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants' application is dismissed.
