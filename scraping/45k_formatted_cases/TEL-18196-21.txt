ROAD SCARBOROUGH ON M1K2E8

and


 




 


Allan Watts Monica
Scales


Tenants



 
Banwatee (aka Judy) Bhajan (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Monica
Scales and Allan
Watts (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord
requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of
residential occupation.
 
The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard via video/teleconference on October 19, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord and the Landlord's Legal Representative attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     This is an application under
section 48(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act).
 
2.     Subsection 48(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2006 (‘the Act’) which states in part:
“a landlord
may, by notice, terminate a tenancy if the landlord
in good faith requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation by
(a) 
the landlord,
(b) 
the landlord’s spouse,
or
(c) 
a child or parent of the landlord
or the landlord’s spouse.
 
3.    
On July 8, 2021 the Landlord
ssent the Tenants
a (N12) Notice to End the Tenancy setting out that the Landlord
requires possession of the rental unit for the following reason.
•        
use by a parent of the Landlord
- *who will provide care services.
 
4.     The termination date in the (N12) notice was September
30, 2021.
5.    
The Tenants did not move out of the rental unit in accordance with the termination date set out in the notice given.




File Number: TEL-18196-21
 
 
 
6.    
At the hearing the Landlord's Legal Representative advised
that the Tenants
vacated the rental unit
October 5, 2021 and are no longer occupants of the rental unit.
 
7.     The Landlord’s application is to end the tenancy
and is therefore moot.
 
8.     The Landlord's Legal Representative requested
daily compensation for use of the rental unit up to October 4, 2021.
 
9.     I denied the request for compensation. The full merits of the application were not heard for a determination on the validity
of the purpose for giving the N12 notice.
 
10.  The order contains
all the reasons for the decision within
the order. No other reasons
will be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants was terminated, as of October 5, 2021, the date the Tenants moved out of
the rental unit.
 
2.     The application is dismissed as
moot.
