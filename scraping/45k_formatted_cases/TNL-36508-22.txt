Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-36508-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


MAIN FLOOR, 803 SHANAHAN BOULEVARD NEWMARKET ON L3X1P9


 




Between:


Yaqun Li


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Carmen Bertilia Romero
Amador Lazaro Urbina Perdomo


Tenants



 
 
 
Yaqun Li (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Lazaro
Urbina Perdomo and Carmen Bertilia Romero Amador (the 'Tenants') and for
an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on February
22, 2021 with respect to application TNL-27726-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants
have not met the following
condition specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $2080.00 rent on
or before January 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $9,266.00 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order TNL-27726-20. The amount that is still owing from that
order is $186.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order TNL-27726-20 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.




 
6.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $2,000.00
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from July 1, 2016 to
January 21, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TNL-27726-20 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before February 1, 2022.
 
3.     As of the date of this order, the Tenants owe no money
to the Landlord because the amount of the rent deposit
and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit
exceeds the arrears of rent, that the Landlord is entitled to under this
order by $526.04.
 
4.     The Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the
Tenants: $68.38 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
January 22, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit;
 
5.     The Landlord or the Tenants
shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a
result of this order.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 1, 2022, then starting February
2, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 2, 2022.

The tenant has until January 31, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 31, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.




 
In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on August 2, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before
this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
