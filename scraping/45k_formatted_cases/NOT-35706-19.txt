Order under Section 31
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOT-35706-19
 
 
 
HH (the 'Tenant') applied for an
order determining that RVPI, D and JD (the 'Landlords') substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential
complex by the Tenant and withheld or deliberately interfered with the reasonable supply of a vital service
that the Landlords
are obligated to supply
under the tenancy agreement.
 
This application was heard on June 2, 2021 in Passcode
250 828 208 VC76 and on July 22, 2021 in Passcode 215 965 491 VC 75. Only the Tenant and the Tenant’s
representative, (‘AB-S’), attended the hearing on June 2, 2021 and only the
Tenant’s representative, AB-S, attended the hearing on July 22, 2021.
 
This application is one of 16
related tenant applications against the Landlords concerning the effective shut down of a mobile
home park (the ‘Park’)
and certain maintenance and repair issues leading up to the time of the
effective shut down.
 
Refer to order NOT-33990-18-HR (the ‘Base Order’)
issued on February
1, 2022, concurrently with this and the other 14
related individual Tenant applications. That order sets out my
determinations on the liability of the Landlords pertaining to events
leading up to the Park’s closure and the availability of
remedies related to the closure itself.
 
The application under file number
NOT-33990-18 was a multi-tenant T2 application brought on behalf of fifteen
tenants identified in Schedule 1 to that order (the ‘Park Tenants’), seeking
relief for the discontinuance of power to the Park. A separate T6 application and/or T2 application was brought by each of the fifteen Park Tenants, seeking relief
for the Landlords’ actions and inactions pertaining to the Park’s water supply,
the Park’s sewage system and the effective closure of the Park. This
application under file NOT-35706-19 is one of those applications.




 
The hearing of issues common to
all of the applications, meaning common to the application under file number NOT-33990-18 and the fifteen
individual applications, proceeded
to completion on July 22,
2022 in Passcode 215 965 491 VC 75 following a number of earlier appearances.
The hearing of the Tenant’s individual issues under file number NOT-35706-19 proceeded on June 2,
2019. The procedural history is set out in the Base Order.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     As noted in the Base Order, these applications concern
issues leading up to and following the closure of the Park on October 30, 2018. The Landlords notified the Tenants at the end of July 2018 that the power would be cut off and that the Park would
effectively be closed on October 30, 2018.
 
2.    
Unlike the other Park Tenants, all of whom had lived in the Park for years, the Tenant did not take up residence at the Park
until July 2018, very shortly before the Landlords provided the Park Tenants
with notice that the Park would be closing at the end of October 2018.
 
3.     The Tenant moved to the Park to be close to her
grandmother, who was one of the Park Tenants.
The Tenant testified that she was not aware,
at the time she moved
to the Park, that there had been various notices pertaining to
problems with the sewage and water systems. She
was aware there had been issues with the water but thought nothing of it.
 
4.    
I questioned whether the Tenant
ever entered into a tenancy agreement with the Landlords when she came to live at the Park. I find the following facts pertaining to that
question, based on the uncontroverted testimony of the Tenant:
 
a)    
The Tenant put a down payment on a
trailer at the Park in July 2018, before she spoke with any of the Landlords
or with anyone who might have acted as agent for the Landlords;
 
b)    
On the day that the Tenant moved
into the trailer at the Park, having already purchased the trailer, she spoke
to the Park’s Superintendent. The
Superintendent phoned one of the Landlords. The two spoke in a
language which the Tenant did not
understand. Following that conversation, the Superintendent told the Tenant
that she could live at the Park and asked that she pay first and last
month’s rent;
 
c)     
The conversation with the
Superintendent took place on a Friday. The following Monday, the Tenant spoke
again with the Superintendent. He told her not to worry
about rent and indicated that she could just stay at the Park;
 
d)    
The Tenant proceeded to pay the balance owing on the
trailer;
 
e)    
The Landlord never took any rent deposit and never accepted
any payment of rent;
and
 
f)      
The Tenant continued to live
at the Park until June 2020.




 
5.    
The Act defines a “tenant”
as a
person who pays rent in return for the right to occupy a
rental unit and defines a “tenancy agreement” as a written, oral or implied
agreement between a tenant and a landlord for occupancy of a rental unit.
 
6.     I find that
the Tenant and the Landlord never
entered into an agreement for the Tenant
to pay rent in return for the right to occupy a trailer at the Park. I find that there was no “tenancy agreement” between the Tenant
and the Landlords and find that the Tenant
was not a “tenant” for the purposes of the Act.
 
7.    
The Act does not apply to the relationship between the Tenant
and the Landlords and the Tenants’ application must be
dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant’s application is dismissed.
