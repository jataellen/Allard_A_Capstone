Tenants




 
 
 
17a Properties (2484899 Ontario
Ltd) (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Michael Mendat and Donna Morrison (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants
pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the
Board on September 2, 2021 with respect to application SOL-12058-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenants have not met the following condition specified in the order: On or about November 21, 2021 the Tenant
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential unit for another
Tenant. This was a breach of the prior agreement.
 
3.       
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,200.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
4.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from September
1, 2016 to January 17, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move
out of the rental
unit on or before
January 28, 2022 (standard 11 days from the
issuance date of this order).




File Number: SOL-26559-21
 
2.       
As of the date of this order, the
Tenants owe no money to the Landlord because the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit
exceeds the that the Landlord is entitled to under this order by
$1,288.87.
 
3.       
Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenants: $42.04 per day for
compensation for the use of the unit starting January 18, 2022 to the date the
Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.       
The Landlord or the Tenants shall pay
to the other any sum of money that is owed as a
result of this order.
 
5.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 29, 2022, then starting January
30, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 30, 2022.
 
 
January 17, 2022

The tenant has until January 28, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 28, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.
