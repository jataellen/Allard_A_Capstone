Order under Section 79
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24928-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


2, 258
SOUTH DRIVE SIMCOE ON N3Y1G8


 




Between:


Joseph Zimba


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jeremiah Green


Tenant



 
 
Joseph Zimba (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
terminating the tenancy
of Jeremiah Green (the 'Tenant') and evicting the
Tenant because he has abandoned the rental unit.
 
This application was heard via video conference on January 5, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord and the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Eduarda
Tereso attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     I find on a balance
of probabilities that the Tenant has abandoned the rental unit.
 
2.     The Landlord discovered on or about July 15, 2021 that
the Tenant appeared to have abandoned the rental unit. The rental unit was inspected at that time by the Landlord who
found the rental unlocked, mailbox to be overfilled, rotten food in the fridge
and the unit was empty. The keys to the rental unit were left in the rental unit. The Landlord
has no reason to believe that this state of affairs had changed as at
the hearing date.
 
3.    
The Landlord has made reasonable
efforts to contact the Tenant. The
Tenant left no forwarding address, and the Landlord
has been unable
to contact the Tenant to confirm
that the unit has been abandoned.
 
4.     The rent is in arrears.
Evidence at the hearing
indicated that the Tenant was in arrears
in the amount of $5,150.00 as at July 1, 2021 and no payments have been
noted since May, 2021.
 
5.     This order contains
all of the reasons in this matter and no further reasons
will be issued.
