Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-25318-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


LOWER,
  52 LOUIS STREET PORT COLBORNE ON L3K1C5


 




Between:


Bashkim Lekaj
  Robert Harper


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Claude Mercier Tammy Siddall-Mercier


Tenants



 
 
Bashkim Lekaj and Robert Harper
(the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Claude Mercier
and Tammy Siddall-Mercier (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 1, 2022. The Landlord, Bashkim Lekaj and the Tenants attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September 15, 2021 to
February 14, 2022. Because of the
arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective October 6,
2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January
15, 2022, the monthly rent is $885.50.
 
4.     The Landlords are not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants paid $2,625.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on
the parties and whether the Landlords attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenants, and find that it would not be unfair to postpone
the eviction until March 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 31, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $1,573.64*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 7, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $29.11 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 8, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full amount
owing* on or before March 31, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from April 1, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before March 31, 2022, then starting April 1, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after April 1, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenants
wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlords or to the Board in trust:
i)          
$1,946.50 if the payment is made on or before February 14, 2022, or
ii)         
$3,717.50 if the payment is made on or before
March 31, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not make full
payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline,
then the Landlords
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after
April 1, 2022 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenants are only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlords.
