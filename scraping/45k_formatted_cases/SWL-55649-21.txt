Homestead Land Holdings Limited
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Matthew Rideout
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 20, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Crystal Sankey attended the hearing. As of 2:28 p.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
July 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
2, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
November 19, 2021. The Tenant
was in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,399.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $229.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from December 18, 2020
to September 2, 2021.

represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to November
19, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.

The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
