Maria Pardo Sergio Meza


Tenants




 
 
 
Hi-Lo Investments Ltd (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sergio Meza and Maria
Pardo (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 31, 2022. The
Landlord's Legal Representative, Sharon Harris
and the Tenant
Mario Pardo assisted
by her translator Kathrine Meza.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the
period from September 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 24, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     As of January
31, 2022, the monthly rent for the unit
is $1,924.72.
 
4.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,900.66 from the Tenants
and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
1, 2021 to January 1, 2022.
 
6.     The Tenants paid $7,628.62 after the application was filed.




 
7.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
including the impact
of COVID- 19 on the parties
and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the
Tenants and, find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction
subject to the condition(s) set out
in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $1,187.80, which represents the arrears of rent
$1,001.80, and costs $186.00
outstanding for the period ending
January 31, 2022.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenants
is denied on the condition
that:
 
(a)

(b)  
The Tenants shall also pay the Landlord the rent for the months of
