Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-25636-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


705, 2067 PROSPECT STREET BURLINGTON ON L7R1Z3


 




Between:


Imh Pool
Vi-a C/o Kipling Res Mgmt


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jordan Teixeira
  Rachel Elston


Tenants



 
 
Imh Pool Vi-a C/o Kipling Res Mgmt (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Rachel Elston and Jordan Teixeira (the
'Tenants') and for an
order to have the Tenants pay the
rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the
order issued by the Board on July 19, 2021 with respect to application
SOL-19463-21.
 
This application was scheduled by videoconference on January 14, 2022 at 9:00am.
 
Only the first-named Tenant
attended the hearing when the matter was called at 9:21am. Neither the Landlord, its agent or its
representative was present at this time. I proceeded to hear the matter
uncontested.
 
I note the Landlord’s representative,
Frank Calcagni, joined the videoconference line at approximately 9:26am, after
the matter had been disposed
of and the Tenant had left the
hearing room. FC disrupted the proceedings, after
being told the matter had been disposed
of, and began to argue with the Board about why he was late, indicating
his son had COVID and concluded by thanking the Board for its accommodation in
a sarcastic tone.
 
The Board’s Rules of Procedure A5.1 indicates a party, representative, witness or support
person is entitled to accommodation of Human Rights Code - Related Needs
by the tribunal and should notify the tribunal as soon as possible if
accommodation is required. Attending the hearing late, after it has concluded
and the opposing
party has left, to seek an accommodation (although there was no
formal request for an accommodation before me) does not align with the Board’s
rules.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    This application was filed pursuant to section 78 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). Applications of this nature
normally result in the Board issuing an eviction order without a hearing. However, this
application was sent to a hearing because the alleged breaches were unclear.




File Number: SOL-25636-21
 
2.   
Since the Landlord did not appear at the hearing to support their application, I find that this
application has been abandoned.
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s L4 application is dismissed.
