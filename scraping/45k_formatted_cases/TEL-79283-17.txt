Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-79283-17
 










 
 
 

M.A.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict J.H.
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.  This
is an L1 application.
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for the
purpose of residential occupation.  This is an L2 application.
 
This
application was heard in Cobourg on April 25, 2017.  The
Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.  H.H. has been removed as
a party to this application.  She is listed in the tenancy agreement as an
occupant and she is not a Tenant.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent he was required to pay for
the period from March 1, 2017 to April 30, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective April 5, 2017.
2.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,300.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
3.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period
from September 2, 2016 to April 5, 2017.
4.    
The Tenant requested a payment plan to pay the arrears of rent. 
The proposal by the Tenant was not reasonable.  Based on his financial
situation, if he was given the plan he requested, he would be left with
approximately $30.00 per month to support his family.  This is not a reasonable
possibility based on the fact he has three children.  Therefore, the request
for a payment plan was denied. 
5.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance
with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until May
31, 2017 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.  The Tenant has
young children.  He is working full time.  This amount of time should enable
him to secure funding to pay the arrears of rent or find suitable
accommodations.
6.    
The L2 application will be dismissed.  The Notice of Termination
served and filed by the Landlord does not comply with the requirements of
section 48 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006.  The termination date
on a Notice of Termination under that section is required to be the last day of
the rental period.  In this matter the rental period runs from the first day of
the month to the last day of the month.  Therefore for the month of July the
last day would be July 31, 2017.  The Landlord listed a termination date of
July 30, 2017. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of
the rental unit on or before May 31, 2017.
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,142.45*, which represents
the amount of rent owing and compensation up to April 27, 2017, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $42.74 per day for
compensation for the use of the unit starting April 28, 2017 to the date they
move out of the unit.
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of
filing the application.
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on
or before May 31, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be
simple interest calculated from June 1, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.    
If the unit is not vacated on or before May 31, 2017, then
starting June 1, 2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
June 1, 2017.
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy,
he must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)       $2,790.00 if the payment is made on or before April 30, 2017, or
ii)      $4,090.00 if the payment is made on or before May 31, 2017**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if he pays the amount required under that
subsection on or after June 1, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession
to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during
the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
10. 
The Landlord’s L2 application is dismissed without prejudice to
the Landlord.
