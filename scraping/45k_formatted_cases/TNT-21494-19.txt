Order under Section 31 and 135
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNT-21494-19
 
 
 
 
 
GM (the 'Tenant') applied for an
order determining that HM (the 'Landlord') harassed, obstructed, coerced,
threatened or interfered with the Tenant and substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenant
or by a member of the Tenant's household (T2 application).
 
Th Tenant also applied
for an order that the Landlord
has collected or retained money illegally (T1 application) and has failed to meet
the Landlord's maintenance obligations under the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act') or failed to comply with health, safety, housing or
maintenance standards (T6 application).
 
These applications were heard
by videoconference on May 5, 2021.
 
The Tenant, the Tenant's
Legal Representative, RB, and the Landlord attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Preliminary Issues
 
Costs
1.    This matter was originally scheduled to be heard on
November 20, 2020 but was adjourned on the day of the hearing at the Landlord’s
request due to the passing of a family member. The Landlord was to provide
proof of the family member’s passing to the Landlord and Board no later than 5 days prior to today’s
hearing; no evidence was received.
 
2.    The Landlord testified that he did not have sufficient time to get evidence of his Uncle’s passing as the service was in Iran
the day prior to the last hearing and he attended virtually.




 
3.   
The Tenant's Legal Representative advised that he was contacted
by the Landlord's Legal
Representative, G. B on May 3, 2021, and was told he was withdrawing from the file as the Landlord had not provided the
requisite proof.
 
4.    The Tenant's Legal Representative submitted that costs in the
amount of $700.00
should be awarded; the Landlord not only delayed the proceedings but
disregarded the Board’s direction to submit evidence corroborating the reason
for the initial adjournment.
 
5.    The Tenant's Legal Representative requested the maximum costs of $700.00. Rule 23 of the Board’s Rules of Practice says:
 
A member may exercise
discretion to order
a party to pay another
party’s:
 
a)     Representation/preparation fees; and
b)     Other out-of-pocket expenses.
 
Where the LTB orders
a party to pay
the representation/preparation fees incurred
by another party, these fees shall not exceed $100 per hour for the services of
a paid representative to a maximum of $700.
6.   
There is no dispute that that the
Landlord did not submit the proof as directed by the Board, therefore, I find
cost are warranted due to the Landlord’s non-compliance; the Landlord had more than sufficient time from November
20, 2020 to today’s date to obtain some form of proof as required.
 
7.    However, the Tenant's
Legal Representative did not
testify as to the amount of time spent preparing for the November
20, 2020 hearing therefore the amount will be restricted to the time spent at
that hearing; one-hour from the 12:30 p.m. sign-in time to 1:30 p.m., when the
adjournment was requested, for a total of $100.00. An order will issue for
same.
 
Amendments
 
8.    On July 29, 2020 the Tenant's Legal Representative
requested to amend the T1 application. As the amendment request
was received prior to the hearing, the request is granted.
 
9.    On January 26, 2021 the Tenant's Legal Representative
requested to amend the T1 application. As the amendment request
was received prior to the hearing, the request is granted.
 
Merits
 
10. For the reasons that follow I find that the Landlord
did not harass the Tenant or substantially interfere with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenant or by a
member of the Tenant's household. (T2 application)




 
11. I also find that the Landlord collected rent in excess
of the amount allowed by the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2016 (the
‘Act’) and did not pay the Tenant the interest
owing on the last month rent deposit contrary to the Act. (T1
application)
 
12. I further find I find that the Landlord failed to meet
the Landlord's obligations under subsection 20(1) {or section
161} of the Act to {repair OR maintain} the rental
unit {and}
{failed to comply with { health OR safety OR housing OR maintenance } standards} . (T6 application)
 
T2 application
 
Substantial Interference and Harassment
 
13. The Tenant testified that on May 29, 2019, the Landlord
served him with a N12 notice of termination because the property had sold, and
the purchaser was moving in. The notice had a number of errors: the termination
date was not the last day of the rental period; the Tenant’s given name was wrong; and, the Landlord’s
surname was incorrectly spelled. He sent the Landlord a letter on June 15, 2019
pointing out the problems and said that a notice needed to be done properly
or they could negotiate terms re vacating.
The Tenant’s letter was
entered into evidence.
 
14. The Tenant also testified that he had a new place for
August 15, 2019, and that the Landlord transferred ownership of the property on
August 8 or 9, 2019. The new owner told
him that the Landlord would have to pay substantial fines if the sale did not
close as per the sales agreement. The new Landlord
also said he was anxious
to get possession so he could
do any necessary repairs and move his family in.
 
15. The Tenant further testified
that he met with the Landlord
to discuss terms of vacating, and they agreed o the following: the Landlord would waive the
last 3 weeks of rent; the Landlord would pay the packing and moving charges;
and the Landlord would pay the Tenant’s new Landlord
the per-diem rent from August 6, 2019 to when the lease started on August 15, 2019. The Landlord only paid
half of the moving, did not pay for the packing because he said it was too
expensive because the Tenant had too much stuff, and did not pay the Tenant’s
new Landlord.
 
16. The Tenant submitted that all of this substantially
interfered with the his reasonable enjoyment because they were inconvenienced
by moving out earlier in order to accommodate the closing date even though the
notice was invalid; they came to a reasonable
arrangement then the Landlord backed
out. This also constitutes harassment because the Landlord backed
out of their deal. The entire time was very stressful nd particularly hard on
his wife who was seriously ill at the time.
 
17. The Landlord testified that the Tenant was given 2
months notice to vacate, this should have been sufficient, but the Tenant wanted to negotiate terms.
In their meeting
he said he would pay for moving costs,
then the Tenant added the pro-rated rent to the new Landlord. Then the Tenant added that the
packing costs should also be paid; the Landlord said that he felt taken
advantage of.




 
18. The Landlord disputed that he agreed to the packing
costs, he agreed to pay for the moving costs and arranged his mover, Ali, to do
the job. The emails between him and the Tenant
on July 31, 2019 prove
that he did not agree to the packing, the Tenant
just added this.
 
Analysis
 
19. This application is based on the rights
and obligations set out in section 22 and 23 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act) which
say:
 
22.  A landlord shall not at any time during a tenant’s occupancy
of a rental unit and before the day on which an order
evicting the tenant is executed substantially interfere with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or the residential complex in which it is located for all usual
purposes by a tenant or members of his or her household.
 
23. 
A landlord
shall not harass,
obstruct, coerce, threaten
or interfere with a
tenant.
 
20. The Act does
not provide a definition of harassment. The Ontario Human Rights Code,
R.S.O. 1990, c. H.19, defines
harassment as “engaging
in a course of vexatious
comment or conduct that is known or ought reasonably to be known to be
unwelcome”.
 
21. Black’s Law Dictionary defines harassment as “a
course of conduct directed at a specific person that causes substantial emotional distress in such person
and serves no legitimate
purpose”.
 
22. Harassment in the landlord and tenant context
is normally considered to be a course of conduct toward a party that a
reasonable person would consider unwelcome and inappropriate.
 
23. The behaviour the Tenant refers to as substantial
interference and harassment is the Landlord reneging on their terms for vacating
August 6, 2019;
the Landlord should
be held to these terms because
the N12 notice was invalid, which meant the Tenant did not have to vacate when
he did.
 
24. The difficulty with this argument
is that the “agreement” between
the Tenant and Landlord
is not part of the Landlord and Tenant relationship. Whatever terms were
arrived at, constitute a separate contract; as such, it is not within the
Board’s jurisdiction to enforce the terms. Therefore, the Tenant’s T2
application must be dismissed.
 
T1 application Illegal Rent
25. The Tenant testified
that the following
were illegal rent increases because
the Landlord did not follow the rules under the Act and
give proper notice:




 
 
 
May 15, 2015 to May 14, 2016 $2,900.00
May 15, 2016 to May 14, 2017 $2,950.00
May 15, 2017 to May 14, 2018 $2,998.25
May 15, 2018 to August 6, 2019* $3,048.00 (*when the Tenant vacated)
 
26. The Landlord testified that he did not recall any
communication with the Tenant about raising the rent, therefore the Tenant must have taken it upon himself to raise the rent; he just accepted the fact that the Tenant
was paying a different amount.
 
Analysis
 
27. I find on a balance of probabilities that the Landlord requested the higher rents; it is highly
unlikely that after paying the same rent since 2013 that the Tenant would suddenly decide a year after this Landlord took
over to start paying more each year. Further, even if the Tenant decided to pay
more, it is still an illegal rent increase if not done pursuant to the Act, and
the Landlord should not have accepted it.
 
28. Section 116 of the Act says:
 
(1)    
A landlord shall not increase the
rent charged to a tenant for a rental unit without first giving the tenant at least 90 days written notice of the
landlord’s intention to do so.
(2)    
Subsection (1) applies even if the
rent charged is increased in accordance with an order under section 126.
(3)    
The notice shall be in a form approved
by the Board and shall set out the landlord’s intention to increase the rent
and the amount of the new rent.
(4)    
An increase in
rent is void if the landlord has not given the notice required by this section, and the landlord must give a new notice
before the landlord
can take the increase.
[Emphasis added]
 
29. Therefore, pursuant to section 116(4) as no N1 notice
of rent increase was given, the increases from May 16, 2016 are illegal
rent increases. Further
section 134(c) of the Act forbids Landlords from charging more
than the lawful rent.
 
30. However, section 136 says rent is deemed lawful unless
an application is filed challenging it within one-year
from when it was charged.
Similarly, s.135.1 says an
increase is deemed valid unless it is challenged within one year after the
date of the increase.
 
31. Therefore, as the Tenant filed the application on September 19, 2019 he is entitled
to go back one year, to
September 19, 2018; as such he is entitled to the illegal rent charged from
September 19, 2018 to August 6, 2019 in the amount of $450.06, calculated as
follows. An order will issue for same.
 
September 19, 2018 to August 6, 2019 = 9 months
and 17 days
•        
From $2,998.25 up to $3,048.00 = $49.75




 
•        
9
months X $49.75 = $447.75
•        
$49.75 ÷ 365 days per year = $0.136
per diem
•        
$0.136 X 17 =
$2.31
•        
$447.75 + $2.31 = $450.06
 
Last month rent deposit
interest
 
32. The Tenant testified
that when he signed the lease on April 4, 2013, he gave the Landlord
a last month rent deposit
in the amount of $2,900.00; the lease was entered into evidence
and showed the Tenant paid this amount as a deposit. The Tenant’s
acknowledgement dated January 14, 2015, that was drawn up when the property
sold, corroborates the lease.
 
33. The Tenant also testified that he was never paid any interest
on his deposit and that it was not used until the last month of his
tenancy, July 15 to August 14, 2019.
 
34. The Landlord testified
that he did not own the property
when the Tenant signed the original
lease, therefore he is not responsible for paying the interest, and when he
bought in 2015, he did not get a deposit from the Tenant. Further, he believes
the Tenant used the deposit when he went month to month.
 
Analysis
 
35. I accept the Tenant’s testimony and evidence and find
that that the Tenant paid a last month rent deposit
of $2,900.00 on April 4, 2013 and this deposit
was not used until the last month of his tenancy.
 
36. Section 18 of the Act sets out that covenants run with
the land, therefore, when the Landlord purchased the property the last month rent deposit
should have been transferred
as part of the sale. If this did not happen, then that issue is between the
previous landlord and the present Landlord; the Tenant is still entitled to the
interest on the deposit.
 
37. However, the Tenant’s
entitlement to interest
on the last month's rent deposit
also raises the issue of the
limitation period.
 
38. Subsection 135(4) of the Act says no order shall be
made with respect to an application filed more than one year after the person
“collected or retained money” in contravention of this Act.
 
39. The meaning of the phrase “collected or retained” has
been considered by a number of Divisional Court decisions including Dollimore
v. Azuria Group Inc., [2001] O.J. No. 4408. That decision states, in essence, that the one-year
limitation does not commence until the
act of retention of the funds at issue ceases.
 
40. Here, the Landlord continued to retain the money to
the date of the hearing
and, as such, I find the limitation period
is not applicable and the Landlord owes the Tenant
the interest for the period
April 4, 2013 to August 6, 2019, when the Tenant vacated.




 
41. With respect to the Tenant vacating, the one-year
limitation period would run from that date, therefore to August 6, 2020. As the Tenant filed the application September
19, 2019, he is well within
the one-year limitation period.
 
42. Therefore, based on the above,
interest is calculated as follows:
 
For the period April
4, 2013 to May 14, 2014 - $2,900.00 x 0.8% = $23.20;
For the period May 15, 2014 to May 14, 2015 - $2,900.00
x 1.6% = $46.40;
For the period May 15, 2015 to
May 14, 2016 - $2,900.00 x 2.0% = $58.00;
For the period May 15, 2016 to May 14, 2017 - $2,900.00 x 1.5% =
$43.50;
For the period May 15, 2017 to May 14, 2018 - $2,900.00
X 1.8% = $52.20;
For the period May 15, 2018 to May 14, 2019 - $2,900.00
X 1.8% = $52.20;
For the period May 15, 2019 to
August 6, 2019 = 83 days, $52.20 ÷ 365 days
= $0.143 X 83 = $11.87.
 
43. The last month rent deposit
interest amount the Landlord owes totals $287.37.
An order will issue for same.
 
T6 application
 
44. The Tenant testified
that in late July 2018 a
large tree fell in the backyard.;
he emailed the Landlord on July 31, 2018 about it falling. When the Landlord
came, he only cut a few branches a moved some branches
to the corner of the lo. The Tenant’s email
and pictures of the fallen
tree from August 2018 through
to June/July 2019 were entered into evidence. The bulk of the tree remained across the lawn and was
still there when the Tenant vacated.
 
45. The Tenant also testified that in October 201 he emailed the Landlord about stones
falling out from the retaining wall. On March 21, 2019, the retaining fall fell
over, he phoned the Landlord right away. The Tenant could not move the bricks
therefore part of the driveway was blocked by the stones.
The Landlord’s only response was to move a few of the stones
closer to the side to give a bit more room on the driveway; he did not repair
the problem. The Tenant entered the picture of the fallen wall from March 21,
2019 into evidence; this was the same state the wall was in when he vacated
August 6, 2019.
 
46. The Tenant further
testified that in October/November 2018 he noticed
some dripping from the ceiling in the living room, by
April 26, 2019 the problem had worsened. Pictures taken March 29, 2019 and July 4, 2019 of the damage
done to the ceiling because of the leaking were
entered into evidence. The Landlord
came late April/early May 2019
and went on the roof; he said the
roof was too far gone to patch; it
will need replaced, which would have to be done down the road. The Landlord did
not do anything to repair the leak or fix the ceiling damage.
 
47. With respect to the tree, the Landlord testified that
it fell at the back of the backyard. He does
not recall exactly
when, but he remembers chopping
branches and moving
them to the side of the house because people use for firewood; the house
had a fire pit.




 
48. As for the
retaining wall, the Landlord testified that he moved
some of the stones
out of the way; the driveway
was long and wide so leaving it as is was not a safety issue and did not
interfere with the Tenant using the driveway. Further, it was only a short wall so it could not have fallen on anyone.
 
49. In regard to the roof, the Landlord testified that he
did not see any water on the floor and there was only small bulging on the ceiling. When he went on
the roof, he saw one shingle was bent, so he fixed it. He told the Tenant the
roof was old and would need fixed in the future. He did not want to replace the roof prior to the closing because
the purchaser would not reimburse him the monies.
 
Analysis
 
50. This application is based on the rights and obligations set out in s. 20(1) of the Act which says:
A landlord is responsible for
providing and maintaining a residential complex, including the rental units in it, in a good state of repair and fit for habitation and for complying with
health, safety, housing and maintenance standards.
 
51. In general, a landlord will not be found liable for
breaching its maintenance obligations under subsection 20(1) of the Act where the landlord responds reasonably to
a maintenance problem (see Onyskiw v. CJM Property
Management Ltd., 2016 ONCA 477).
 
52. I am satisfied on a balance
of probabilities that the rental
unit was not maintained in a good state of repair. The evidence and
testimony of the Tenant demonstrates that the Landlord did not address the fallen tree,
the fallen retaining, or the sagging
ceiling due to the leaking roof. The Landlord’s testimony
came across as excuses for why he only did what he did, for example moving a
few branches and stones but leaving the fallen tree and retaining wall. As for
the bulging ceiling, the Landlord seemed to consider this only minor, and
ultimately did nothing
to address the issue. He also testified that he did not replace
the roof because of the
expense that would not be reimbursed to him by the purchaser.
 
53. Therefore, based on the above, I find the Landlord is
in breach of his maintenance and repair obligations under section 20 of the Act and the Tenant
is entitled to some remedy,
the quantum of which will be discussed under “Remedy”.
 
Remedy
 
54. The Tenant is requesting a total rent abatement of
$4,862.57 for all three issues. This amount is comprised
of $3,553.97 for the fallen
tree from July 2018 to August 6, 2019;
$149.40 for the fallen retaining wall from March 2019 to August 6, 2019; and $1,159.20 for the ceiling from November 2019 to
August 6, 2019.
 
55. Here, any abatement ordered is subject
to the one-year limitation period,
therefore remedy can only be granted
from September 19, 2018 onward.
 
56. With respect to the abatement of the rent, an
abatement is designed to address the idea that
a tenant is paying for a bundle of goods and services
and if the tenant is not receiving




 
the full bundle then the rent should be abated proportionate to the difference between what is being
paid for and what is being received.
 
57. The Tenant testified that due to the fallen tree they
did not have full use of the back yard it also hindered being able to properly mow
the lawn. With respect to the fallen retaining
wall, this was a safety hazard if it fell on someone, plus it interfered
with being able to use the entire driveway. The rent includes being able
to use the entire rental property, and they could not do this because of the fallen tree and retaining wall. As for the ceiling,
the leaking was a safety issue
because it dripped through the electrical outlet. When it rained hard the
Tenant had to put pots underneath to catch the water, and to avoid damage to belongings
he had to rearrange the living room so things would not get wet. The bulging
and hole in the ceiling were also an eye-sore; he should not have had to live
with the ceiling in disrepair.
 
58.
Based on the
Tenant’s testimony, I find he was not receiving the full bundle of
goods that he had been paying
for; therefore, he is entitled to an abatement of rent. As there was
insufficient evid3nce to establish any safety issues, I find a reasonable
amount of abatement to be 5% for all issues,
for a total of $1,232.46, calculated as follows.
An order will issue for same.
 
Rent: $3048.00
X 12 months/year = $36,576.00 ÷ 365 days/year = $100.21 per day
Abatement percentage: $100.21 X 5% = $5.01
Tree: September
19, 2018 to August 6, 2019 = 321 days X $5.01 = $1,608.21 Wall: March
21, 2019, when the wall fell, to August 6, 2019 = 138 days X $5.01
=
$691.38
Ceiling: November
1, 2018 to August 6, 2019 = 279 days X $5.01 = $1397.79 Average: $1,608.21 + $691.38 +
$1,397.79 = $3,697.38 ÷ 3 = $1,232.46
 
59. This order contains
all the reasons for the decision within
it. No further reasons shall be
issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.      
The Tenant’s T2 application is dismissed.
 
2.    
For the T1 application, the

3.    
For the T6 application, the Landlord shall
pay to the Tenant a rent abatement
of
$1,232.46.
 
4.    
The Landlord shall also pay the Tenant $50.00
for the cost of filing the applications.
 
5.    
The Landlord shall also pay the Tenant
costs in the amount of $100.00.




 
6.    
The total amount the Landlord owes
the Tenant from all applications, including the application filing fee and costs awarded
is $2,119.89. The Landlord shall pay this amount
in full by February 11 2022.

calculated from February 12, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
 
8.    
The Tenant has the right, at any time,
to collect the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
