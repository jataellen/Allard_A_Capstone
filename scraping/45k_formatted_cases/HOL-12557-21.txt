In the matter of:      41 GERANIUM CRESCENT

Cindy Silvera Claudio Silvera


Tenants




 
 
 
Jiangnan Li (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Cindy
Silvera and Claudio Silvera (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not
pay the rent that they owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 17, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord and the Landlord's Legal Representative, Alvin Chan, attended
the hearing. As of 10:17
a.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from March 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective November 10, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly rent is $3,900.00 as of February 1,
2022. The rental unit is exempt from rent control
rules pursuant to section 6.1(2)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
because the rental unit is a brand new build that was first occupied for
residential purposes in February 2019.
 
4.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $2,900.00
from the Tenants and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.




File Number: HOL-12557-21
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from February
1, 2019 to February 2, 2022.
 
6.     The Tenants have made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 8, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $15,598.81*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 25, 2022,
less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$128.22 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 26, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before March 8, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from March 9,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 8, 2022, then starting
March 9, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 9, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)     $19,446.00 if the payment is made on or before
February 28, 2022,
or
ii)    $23,346.00 if the payment is made on or before
March 8, 2022**.
If the Tenants
do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline,
then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that
subsection on or after March 9, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are




File Number: HOL-12557-21
 
only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
