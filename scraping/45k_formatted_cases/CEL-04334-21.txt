In the matter
of:

FREDERICA DRIVE MISSISSAUGA
  ON L4Y3A6


 




Between:


3125 Queen Frederica Holdings Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Charmaine Allen


Tenant



 
 
 
3125 Queen Frederica Holdings
Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Charmaine Allen (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant
pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on July 7, 2021 with respect to
application CEL-98326-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could
apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order: the Tenant did not pay the lawful
rent for December on or before December 1, 2021.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $7,611.66 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
CEL-98326-21. The amount
that is still owing from that
order is $2,086.44 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order CEL-98326-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from December 1, 2021 to December 30, 2021.
 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,150.38 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.




File Number: CEL-04334-21
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from November 1, 2015
to January 14, 2022.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The previous
order CEL-98326-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 25, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,065.42*. This amount represents the rent owing up to December 31, 2021 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $40.69
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January
25, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January
25, 2022, then starting January
26, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 26, 2022.

The tenant has until January 24, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 24, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
