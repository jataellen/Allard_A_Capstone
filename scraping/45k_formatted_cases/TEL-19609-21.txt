In the matter
of:


2, 31 BOYCE
AVENUE AVENUE SCARBOROUGH ON
  M1J1K4


 




Between:


Arjuna Sarathchandran


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Shanell Sampson


Tenant



 
 
 
Arjuna Sarathchandran (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Shanell Sampson (the 'Tenant) because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
way of video conference on January 5, 2022. The Landlord’s
Agent Pran Ganesh and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
On September 2, 2021 the Landlord served a Notice
of Termination (N4 notice)
with a termination date of
September 17, 2021. The N4 notice claims that the Tenant owes
$5,661.59 for the period from May 1,2021 to September 30, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s N4 notice of termination is defective as it does not
correctly set out the lawful rent
charged for the period of May 1, 2021 to July 31, 2021. The N4 notice indicates that for this period,
the Tenant has been charged
$6,350.00 in rent, has paid
$3,788.41 and owes $2,561.59. However, the lawful
monthly rent during
this period was
$1,550.00. Therefore, the total
rent owing for this 3-month
period is $4,650.00, not
$6,350.00. Once the Tenant’s
payment of $3,788.41 is applied, the Tenant
owes $861.59 in arrears of
rent for this period, and not $2,561.59 as claimed in the N4 notice.
 
3.    
As the Landlord’s N4 notice does not set out the correct amount charged and is requiring the Tenant to pay more than the
Landlord is lawfully entitled to, the notice does not comply with section 59(2)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act).
As the N4 notice is defective the
Board does not have the authority to terminate the tenancy.
 
4.    
The Landlord’s Agent was explained
the options available
as a result of the defective N4 including; withdrawing the L1
application, serving a new N4 notice and filing a new

application or proceeding with the current
application to collect
arrears of rent only
pursuant to Section 87 (1) (a) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
Act).
 
5.    
The Landlord’s
Agent was advised that the option to proceed with arrears of rent only would
not result in a termination of tenancy should the Tenant breach, but rather would
have to be enforced in another jurisdiction such as small claims court
for collection of any
outstanding funds owing.
The Landlord’s Agent was also advised that the Landlord
would not be permitted to claim these arrears on a new N4 if the option
to proceed with arrears only was selected.
 
6.    
The Landlord’s Agent requested that the matter
proceed with claiming arrears
of rent only and confirmed that he understood the
remedies available should the Tenant not comply with the terms of the order.
Arrears of rent:
 
7.    
The parties
do not dispute that the amount of rent arrears
owing from May 1, 2021 to
January 31, 2022 are $10,161.59.
 
8.    
The Tenant
testified that she is currently not working and not in a position
to pay the rent arrears
owing. The Landlord is willing to
allow the Tenant 3-months to pay the outstanding arrears.
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $10,161.59, which represents the amount of rent
owing up to January 31, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before April 26, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from April 27, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
