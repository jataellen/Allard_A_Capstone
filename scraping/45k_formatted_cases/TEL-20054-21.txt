Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-20054-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


494 STEVENSON ROAD
N OSHAWA ON L1J5N6


 




Between:


Luisa Longo


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jeff Harris Kaytlyn
Poppel


Tenants



 
 
 
Luisa Longo (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kaytlyn Poppel and Jeff
Harris (the 'Tenants') because they have been persistently late in paying their
rent. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained
in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 18, 2022.
 
Luciella Longo, on behalf
of the Landlord, the Landlord's Legal Representative, Brett
Lockwood, and the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
The Tenants spoke with Duty Counsel
prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     Based on the particulars contained in the N8 Notice of
Eviction served to the Tenants on September
21,2021, I find that from January 2020 to July 21, 2021,
the Tenants were late
paying their rent 11 months out of the 21-month period.
 
2.     The termination date on the notice is November 30, 2021.
 
3.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,800.00
from the Tenants and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
4.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from June 23, 2019 to
November 30, 2021.
 
5.     The Landlord’s Agent
testified that the Landlord
is 82 years old and struggling
with health issues. She relies on the
rent to pay her bills; the rent being late or not paid has been very stressful
and affected her physically and financially. The rent was usually paid in




 
cash to the Landlord, but since November
2021 a property manager has been
hired. The Agent also testified that
she believes the property manager reached out to the Tenants shortly after
being hired with respect to their intention of paying rent, but there was no
response. The Tenants have not paid any rent since September 2021 and now owe
approximately $9,000.00 in rent arrears.
 
6.     Kaytlyn Poppel (KP) testified that because the
Landlord is elderly, she requested cash; the Landlord would come to the rental
unit to pick up the rent money. The late payments are mostly to do with the
Landlord picking up the rent payments late. They have spoken to or left a
message monthly with the new property manager about their financial situation. Things
have been difficult because Jeff Harris
lost his job due to COVID-19 and she is waiting
for her OSAP to come in; the property manager
is aware of all this. KP
also testified that if a pay-on-time is granted, $4,500.00 could be paid
towards the arrears within 2 days, her mother will give the money, and the rest
can be paid when OSAP comes in; if the tenancy is terminated then the money
would have to go to moving.
 
7.    
The Landlord's Legal
Representative submitted that he understands that the Board’s policy is to
grant pay-on-time conditional orders when the circumstances warrant such;
however, here the circumstances do not. There is no evidence that the Tenants
can afford to stay, and no evidence submitted with respect to OSAP. Further,
there has been no show of good faith; nothing has
been paid since September 2021. The Landlord is suffering financially due to
the late payments; eviction is necessary. The Landlord is seeking the standard
11-days and the application filing fee.
 
8.      I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 28, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b)
of the Act. I accept that the
Landlord has suffered financial difficulties due to the persistently late
payment of rent, however allowing the Tenants to stay until February 28, 2022
does not prejudice the Landlord any further as the last month rent deposit will
go toward February rent. As this is not a rent arrears application, I cannot
consider the Tenants’ repayment plan.
 
9.     This order contains
all the reasons
for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated, as of
February 28, 2022. The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before February 28, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $1,530.97, which represents compensation for the use of the
unit from December 1, 2021 to January 26, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $59.18
per day for compensation for the use of the unit from January 27, 2022 to
the date they move out of the unit.




 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February 28, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 1,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 28, 2022, then starting
March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 1, 2022.
