Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-18048-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


62, 595 RYMAL
ROAD E HAMILTON ON L8W3V6


 




Between:


Hamilton East Kiwanis Np Homes Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Sheri Konkle


Tenant



 
 
 
Hamilton East Kiwanis Np Homes
Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sheri Konkle (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
695 7516 4596#
on June 8, 2021.
 
{The Landlord
and the Tenant attended the
hearing.}
 
OR Only {the Landlord
OR the Tenant} attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
April 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective November
16, 2020.
 
2.     The Tenant paid $1,860.00 after the application was filed.
 
3.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until March 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
4.     This is a rent geared to income unit. The Tenant
indicated she obtain her documentation notarized as requested by the Landlord
last week but didn’t have
technology or means to get it to the Landlord before
the hearing. The Landlord was opposed to giving the Tenant
additional time to provide the information since this application has been
ongoing since November 17, 2020 and the matter was previously adjournment at
the June 2021 hearing. The Tenant has had ample time to obtain and provide
information to the Landlord to reassess her subsidy. The Landlord is not opposed to postponing termination date to
March 31, 2022.

at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before

If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
