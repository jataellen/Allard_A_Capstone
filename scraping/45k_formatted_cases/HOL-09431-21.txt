Order under Section 69

File Number: HOL-09431-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1421, 135
VILLAGE GREEN SQUARE TORONTO ON M1S0G4


 




Between:


Catarina Terra
  Mathew Burr


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Jada Wright


Tenant



 
 
Catarina Terra and Mathew
Burr (the 'Landlords') applied for an order requiring Jada Wright (the 'Tenant') to pay compensation for the
damages caused to the rental unit.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 7, 2022.
 
Only the Landlords attended the
hearing.   And were represented by Roxanne McLeod. The Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this
hearing by the Board. There was no record of a request to adjourn the hearing.
As a result, the hearing proceeded with only the Landlords’ evidence.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant was still in possession of the rental
unit as of the date the application was filed. However, the Tenant vacated
the rental unit on August 20, 2021, in accordance with an interim order made on
July 30, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlords purported to serve
third (non-voidable) N5 notice on the Tenant at the rental unit after the
Tenant had vacated the unit. Based on
that N5, the Landlords requested that this application be amended to increase
the amount of compensation sought from the Tenant to $10,858.74 based on damages
that the Landlord
asserts the Tenant caused to
the rental unit.
 
3.    
The interim order made on July 30,
2021, contemplated that the parties would appear before the Board to determine whether
the Tenant is responsible for the damages
alleged in this application. The
interim order did not, in my view complete that the Landlords would amend their
application subsequent to the Tenant vacating the rental unit to claim
additional compensation from the Tenant. The
request to amend the application is denied.

4.    
The Tenant did not attend to defend the application or dispute that she was responsible
for the damages alleged in the application. I
have considered the Landlords’ evidence,
including invoices, and find that: (a) the Tenant has wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the rental unit, and (b) Landlords have incurred costs
of $2,159.00 to repair the damage.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlords’ request
to amend their application is refused.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $2,159.00, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00
for the cost of filing this application.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlords the full amount owing on or before
March 2, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 3, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
