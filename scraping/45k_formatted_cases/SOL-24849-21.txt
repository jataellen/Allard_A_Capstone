Tenants



 
 
 
8800 Willoughby
Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Jennifer Wheeler and Scott Ellis (the 'Tenants') because they have been
persistently late in paying their rent. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
It is undisputed that the Tenant,
J. Wheeler, has now legally
changed her name to J. Ellis, and the application was amended
accordingly.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 5, 2022.
The Landlord’s agent, K. Aspros,
and the Tenants attended the hearing.
Determinations:
1.    
The Landlord
alleges that the Tenants have persistently failed
to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
2.    
The Tenants dispute the
application because they always communicated with the property manager
about when the rent would be
late. They said that they had
very good reasons for the rent being late,
the Landlord was aware it would be late, and the Tenants always stuck to their payment
arrangement. They said that they
always try to pay on time.
 
3.    
The Tenants
said that if the Landlord’s application is successful, they would require
3 months to pay the filing fee.
 
4.     It was undisputed that the monthly rent is
due on the first day of the month. It
is the Tenant’s obligation to pay the rent on time. It is undisputed that the Tenants
paid the rent late at least five times in 2021. Merely because a Landlord consents to accept
rent

payments late
does not mean that a Landlord waives their right to receive the rent payment on time. Consequently, I find that it was within the Landlord’s rights
to file an L2
application for persistent late payment of rent.
 
5.    
The Landlord
is seeking an order to have the Tenants pay the rent on
time.
 
6.    
Considering the undisputed persistent late payment of rent, I find that an order to pay the
rent on time is appropriate.
 
7.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances above in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from
eviction subject to the conditions
set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Commencing February,
2022, and continuing each month for a twelve month period, up to, and including,
January, 2023, the Tenants shall pay the full monthly
rent no later than the first
day of each of those months, respectively.
 
2.     The Tenants shall also pay to
the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing the application
as follows:
 
(a) 
$62.00 on or before
February 1, 2022, (b)$62.00 on or before March 1,
2022,
(c) $62.00
on or before April 1, 2022.
 
3.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing pursuant to paragraph
2 on or before April 1,
2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from April 2, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.    
Section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 applies to paragraph 1 of this order. If the Tenants
fail to make any payment, the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenants,
apply to the Board for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenants. The Landlord must make this application no later than 30 days after the Tenants fail to make a
payment.
