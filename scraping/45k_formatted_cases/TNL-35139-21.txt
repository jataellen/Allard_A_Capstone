Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: TNL-35139-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1801, 18 ERSKINE AVENUE TORONTO ON M4P1Y2


 




Between:


18 Erskine Holdings Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Ivan Ramirez


Tenant



 
 
 
 
18 Erskine Holdings Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Ivan Ramirez (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
24, 2022. The Landlord's Legal Representative, Leo Corsetti, and
the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October
1, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $2,400.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,400.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and
find that it would not be unfair to delay the eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act. The Tenant proposed a payment plan which would see the
arrears paid off in approximately 15 months, however, he does not have enough
income to fulfill the payment plan.
The Tenant said his parents will provide him with enough
funds to fulfil the payment plan. The Landlord was opposed to the
payment plan. I did not find it




 
 
 
 
appropriate to grant the Tenant's
request for relief from eviction in the form of a payment plan because the
Tenant is unable to sustain the payment plan on his own (which decreases the
probability that he will be able to adhere to the payment plan), and because no
payments have been made since the application was filed (which indicates a lack
of commitment to paying off the arrears). The Tenant did say that he has sought
assistance from the rent bank and that they have indicated they might be able
to assist him if he comes up with some of the arrears on his own. He also said that he may be able to access some other funds in
February. I find it appropriate under these circumstances to delay the eviction
date to February 28, 2022 to give the Tenant additional opportunity to
void the order and continue the tenancy.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$9,704.70*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 31, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $78.90 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$12,186.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022,
or
ii)             
$14,586.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.




 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after March
1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
