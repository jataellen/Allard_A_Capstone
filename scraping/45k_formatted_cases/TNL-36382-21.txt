919
  MEMORIAL CIRCLE NEWMARKET ON L3X0B6


 




Between:


Denise Chan

Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Jason Smith Mary
Butcher


Tenants



 
 
 
Denise Chan and Huaifeng Xu (the
'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jason
Smith and Mary Butcher (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord has entered into an
agreement of purchase and sale of the rental unit and the purchaser requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation. The Landlords also claimed
compensation for each day the
Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 20, 2022 at 3:29 PM.
 
The Landlords, Denise Chan and Huaifeng
Xu, and the Tenant,
Mary Butcher, attended
the hearing. The Landlords
were represented by Barrington Lue Sang. Roger
Feng provided testimony for the Landlords.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
For the reasons set out below, I
find that Roger Feng has an agreement with the Landlords to purchase the residential
complex and he in good faith requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
Therefore, the tenancy is terminated effective April 15, 2022.
 
2.     On October 20, 2021, the Landlords served
the Tenants with an N12 notice of termination
seeking termination of the tenancy for the purpose of residential occupation by
a purchaser. The termination date set out in the N12 notice is January 3, 2022. The tenancy is month-to-month with rent
payable on the fourth day of each month, therefore the termination date was at
the end of a rental period.
 
3.    
The Landlord paid the Tenant compensation equal to one month's rent prior to the termination
date on the Notice of Termination.




 
4.    
The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $2,370.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from September 4, 2019 to January 3, 2022.
 
Good Faith
 
6.    
The N12 was served pursuant to section 49 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act). Section 49(1) requires that, in
order to be successful in this application, the Landlords must establish that
at the time of the service of the N12 Notice, a purchaser required, in good
faith, the unit for residential use.
 
7.     In Feeney v. Noble, 1994 CanLII 10538 (ON SC),
the Court held that the test of good faith is genuine intention to occupy the
premises and not the reasonableness of the Landlord’s proposal. This principle was upheld in Salter v.
Beljinac 2001 CanLII 40231 (ON SCDC) where
the Court held that the “good faith”
requirement simply means that the
Landlord sincerely intends to occupy the rental unit. The Landlord may also
have additional motives for selecting a particular rental unit, but this does
not affect the good
faith of the Landlord’s notice.”
 
8.     The Landlord entered into an agreement of purchase and
sale dated October 17, 2021, with Roger Feng as the purchaser. At the date of the hearing, the
transaction had a closing date of March 21, 2022, although
Mr. Feng testified
that there is some flexibility to extend the transaction. Mr.
Feng swore an affidavit which was filed with the application confirming that he
required the rental unit for his residential use. In his testimony at the hearing, Mr. Feng indicated that he
currently lives in Aurora not far from the rental unit. The new property is
larger than his existing house, and represents an upgrade of his existing
housing. He intends to sell his
current house once the transaction closes, and move his family of five into the
rental unit.
 
9.     The Tenant alluded to some evidence of her past relationship
with the current Landlords as possibly pointing to bad faith, but as noted at
the hearing, the test for good faith in an L2/N12 for purchaser’s own use is the genuineness of the purchaser’s intention to occupy the rental unit. While bast tempestuous relationships
between a landlord and tenant might inform an inference of bad faith on an
application for owner’s own use, such past issues would not in themselves be pertinent to my consideration in a purchaser’s own use application.
 
10.  I therefore find that the purchaser
in good faith requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of
residential occupation
 
Relief from eviction
 
11.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until April 15, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.




 
 
 
12.  The purchaser testified, and introduced redacted
medical documents, that she has had recent severe health problems. While there was no third-party testimony
to corroborate these assertions, I accept on the aggregate of the evidence
before me, coupled with my observations of the Tenant’s health during the
hearing, that there are compromising factors impacting the Tenant, and that a
standard enforcement order of 11 days would prejudice the Tenant. In addition, her son and grandson also live with her. While she has had some time to find a new rental
unit, I take note that her search for a similar unit has been unsuccessful, and
her current state of health would preclude a quick move. Se has asked for as long a delay in the eviction as possible, of
the order of six months.
 
13.  The transaction is currently scheduled to close March
21, 2022, although as previously noted the purchaser has some flexibility. The Landlords of course have carrying and
potential extension costs to worry about, although in the context of a sales
agreement well in excess of $1.5 million,
and such financial inconvenience does not in my view rise to the level of unfairness. I am not satisfied that a termination date in April will be fatal to
their contract closing.
 
14.  It is altogether unfortunate that in this instance the
real estate agents of vendor and purchaser did not turn their minds to the
contingency of the Tenant successfully sustaining an argument that eviction
should be delayed.
In addressing the tenancy, the purchase agreement contains only the provisions, “The Seller agrees and warrants that The Buyer
shall have vacant
possession of The Property on the Closing
Date” and “The
buyer agrees to cooperate
with the seller in applying
to the Landlord and Tenant Board
to evict the tenant.” The
conveyancing contract does not address proactively the rights of the vendor and
purchaser – termination, extension, or assumption of the tenancy – if vacant
possession is not available on the closing date. Conveyancing contracts drafted in ignorance of this contingency
in my view ought not to be set up to substantially constrain an exercise of discretion under
section 83 of the Act, particularly when it is clear
that there is flexibility as to the closing date between the parties to the
agreement of purchase and sale.
 
15.  In the overall circumstances, I feel that the date of
April 15, 2022 represents an appropriate and fair balance of the interests
of all parties, as it affords
a reasonable time for the Tenant to find alternate
accommodations. I have regard to the
fact that both Landlords and purchaser have alternate shelter arrangements in
the interim, and the Tenant does not. I
am also satisfied that the parties to the purchase agreement have sufficient flexibility to extend to this period
without causing inconvenience that would rise to the level of unfairness.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated, as of
April 15, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
April 15, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords
$302.57, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from January 4, 2022
to February 7, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on
the rent deposit.




 
 
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords
$77.92 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from February 8, 2022 to
the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.     Any amounts that the Tenants
have paid to rent due in January
and/or February 2022 shall be offset against the foregoing
amounts.
 
5.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing on or before February 18, 2022,
they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
April 15, 2022, then starting
April 16, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after April 16, 2022.
