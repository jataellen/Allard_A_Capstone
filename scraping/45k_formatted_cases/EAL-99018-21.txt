In the
  matter of:


3, 1670 KILBORN
AVENUE OTTAWA ON K1H6M9


 




Between:


Ottawa Community Housing


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Houssein Nsengiyumva
  Mariam Kabwari


Tenants



 
On November 30, 2021, Ottawa
Community Housing (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Mariam
Kabwari and Houssein
Nsengiyumva (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe
because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on June
29, 2021 with respect to application EAL-92484-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I
find that the Tenants have not met the following
condition(s) specified in the order:
 
The Tenants failed
to pay to the Landlord
$300.00 on or before November
1, 2021 towards arrears of
rent.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $8,712.00 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order EAL-92484-20. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $6,913.00 and that amount
is included in this order. As a result, the previous order EAL-92484-20 is
cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenants
have also failed
to pay the full rent that
became owing for the period from November 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.

It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Order EAL-92484-20 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 30, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlord $8,014.00*. This amount represents the rent owing up to November 30, 2021 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$36.20 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting December 1, 2021
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
30, 2022, the Tenants will start
to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from
January 31, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 30, 2022, then starting January
31, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 31, 2022.

The tenant has until January 29, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under
s.
78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 29, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In
