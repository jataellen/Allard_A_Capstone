In the matter
of:


UPPER, 251 DOURO
STREET STRATFORD ON N5A3S4


 




Between:


Purnima Kataria


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Robert Kinnear


Tenant



 
 
 
Purnima
Kataria (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Robert Kinnear (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another
tenant. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit
after the termination date.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on January 10, 2022. The
Landlord’s legal agent,
R. Kataria, the Landlord’s legal representative, D. Jasper, the Tenant’s legal representative, J. Hilderbrand, and the Tenant attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     On June 14, 2021, the Landlord served the Tenant with
an N5 Notice to terminate the tenancy (the ‘N5 Notice’) pursuant to section 64
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).
 
2.    
On an attachment to the N5, it states as follows:
 
Please note that I should receive
soon from the police an itemized list of dates
and times they have been called for noise and other
complaints.
 
3.    
An email is attached
from a person named ‘Gary Muma’ listing
dates and times.
However, the email does not list what occurred during these dates and
times, whether there was noise or “other complaints” or described what the
“other complaints” entail.
 
4.    
I
find that the N5 Notice is unduly vague as it lacks necessary references to specific details including dates and times for the
Tenant’s noise or described what “other complaints” entails. While the Landlord
submitted the Tenant was aware of the prohibited conduct before the notice, and intended to lead direct
evidence of the Tenant’s alleged
misconduct at the hearing,
the problem lies in the actual text of the originating document
– the N5




File Number: SWL-52584-21
 
Notice – which is the document
against which the respondent Tenant
must craft his answer.
I find on the balance of probabilities that
the vague allegations contained in the N5 Notice frustrated his ability to
fully and properly respond to the application.
If the Tenant is deprived of the ability to know the precise dates and substance
of various allegations prior to the hearing, the missing information necessarily
compromises his defence.
 
5.     According to the Ontario Divisional Court’s decisions
in both Kuzyk v. S.K. Properties1 and
Ball v. Metro Capital Property and Lockhurst,2 if a notice of termination
issued by a landlord is confusing to the degree that a reasonable person could
not understand the precise actions or omissions that caused the landlord to pursue
eviction, a Member would find it defective. Specifically, the Court in Ball stated that “particulars should
include dates and times of the
alleged offensive conduct, together with a detailed description of the alleged
conduct engaged in by the tenant.”3 A defect in a notice of termination cannot be cured
through direct evidence or clarifications offered at the subsequent merits
hearing.
 
6.     In the present case, I find that the N5 Notice is
defective as it is excessively vague and devoid of necessary details with
respect to the allegations that provide the basis for the application. The Landlord may not rely upon this notice
to terminate the tenancy.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord's application is dismissed.
