Order
under Sections 69 and 35
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: CEL-64051-17











 
 

TN (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict MPH (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes (L1 Application).
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation (L2
Application). 
 
The Landlord also applied for an order
determining whether the Tenant altered the locking system without the
Landlord's consent (L8 Application).
 
This application was heard in Mississauga
on March 16, 2017.
 
The Landlord,
Landlord's Legal Representative, BG and the Tenant attended the hearing.  AK
was witness for the Landlord.
 
Determinations and
Reasons:
 
Regarding L1 rent
arrears application
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the
Tenant was required to pay for the period from December 1, 2016 to March 31,
2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective January 23, 2017.
2.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $799.00
from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenant for the period from June 13, 2015 to January 23, 2017.
Regarding L2 Landlord own use application
4.     
The Landlord served the Tenant with an N12
notice of termination effective February 28, 2017 claiming the Landlord
intended to move into the rental unit.
5.     
Subsection 43(1)(a) of the Residential
Tenancies Act 2006 (the 'Act') specifies that a notice of termination shall
identify the rental unit for which the notice is given.
6.     
The N12 notice specifies the street number and
name.  The rental unit, which is the basement unit of a house is not indicated
in the notice.
7.     
The Landlord's Legal Representative argued that
the street address satisfies the requirement of subsection 43(1)(a) of the Act.
8.     
Respectfully, I disagree.   This interpretation
would lead to an absurd result if the unit identifier of a rental unit is not
indicated.  An example would be a rental unit located in a complex consisting
of many units.  Merely indicating the street number and address would suggest
that the notice of termination applies to the entire building.  In this
circumstance, the notice of termination would apply to the entire house which
the tenant is not renting.
9.     
The N12 notice is defective because it fails to
identify the rental unit.  As this notice forms the basis of the L2
Application, the Board does not have jurisdiction to terminate the tenancy
under this application.
Regarding L8 lock changed application
10.  
Section 35 of the Act specifies that a tenant
shall not alter the locking system on a door giving entry to a rental unit or
rental complex without the consent of the Landlord.
11.  
AK testified that she was unable to access the
rental complex or unit on January 20th.  She said that none of her
keys worked and that they worked the day before. 
12.  
The Tenant denies changing the locks and
believes that AK had the wrong keys because AK previously gave him copies of
keys that did not work.  
13.  
I am not satisfied that the Tenant changed the
keys to the rental unit.  The Tenant offered a reasonable explanation why the
keys worked on January 19th and then did not work on January 20th. 
AK testified that all three keys to the unit did not work.  There were three
keys provided to the Tenant, two for the side entry door and one to the entry
door.  It is implausible how AK would know that none of the keys worked when
she was unable to access the side door to test the keys to the rental unit.  AK
admitted that the keys looked alike when asked by the Tenant if the keys she
used to attempt entry on January 20th looked the same as his keys. 
AK did not provide any evidence of any visible change to the side entry door
lock in her testimony.
Relief from eviction
14.  
The Landlord seeks eviction as soon as possible
because no payments have been received from the Tenant since December, there is
substantial prejudice to the Landlord who is experiencing financial
difficulties with mortgage payments and the Tenant’s evidence is contradictory.
15.  
The Tenant seeks six weeks to repay arrears.  He
said he is seeking assistance through the homelessness prevention program and
requires the Board order to access this type of funding.  The Tenant testified
that he recently started working again and is hoping for stability at his
workplace.  He lives with his 5 year old son in a shared custody arrangement.
16.  
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction
until April 20, 2017 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.  This is 12
days longer than the 11 day standard order requested by the Landlord, a short
delay to reduce the prejudice to the Landlord.
It is ordered that:
 
L1 rent arrears
application
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out
below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The
Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before April 20, 2017.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,262.05*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to March 28,
2017, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $26.27
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting March 29, 2017 to the
date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00
for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before April 8, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe
interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from April 9, 2017 at 2.00%
annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated on or before April
20, 2017, then starting April 21, 2017, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord, on or after April 21, 2017.
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void this order and
continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $3,386.00 if the payment is made on or before March 31, 2017, or
ii)       $4,185.00 if the payment is made on or before April 20, 2017**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after April 21, 2017 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to
make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.

use application
10.  
The Landlord’s L2 application is dismissed.
