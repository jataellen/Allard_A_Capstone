Review Order
 
Hongfei Wang (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Yoojeong Kim and Byoungmoon Kim (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was resolved
by order TNL-27494-20 issued on October
21, 2021.
 
On November 17, 2021, the Tenants
requested a review
of the order alleging the order contained serious errors with respect to
the calculations of arrears of rent.
 
On November 22, 2021, the Board issued interim
order TNL-27494-20-RV-IN staying
the order issued on October
21, 2021 until the request is resolved.
 
The Tenants’ request was heard by
way of video conference on January 28, 2022.
The Landlord’s Representative, Robert
Au (husband-authorization on
file), the Tenant, Byoungmoon Kim (‘BK’) and the Tenants’
daughter, Keon Hee Kim (‘KK’) attended the hearing. The Tenant, Yoojeong Kim’s interested were represented by BK who is
her husband. The Tenants’ daughter assisted BK as an interpreter
and Representative.
 
Determinations:
 
Tenants’ Request for Review
 
1.       
KK submitted that the arrears of
rent as calculated in the order issued on October 21, 2021 are incorrect. KK
agrees that the Tenants owe arrears of rent, but in the lower amount of $6,186.00 because the Landlord gave the Tenants an abatement of rent for the
months April 2020 and
June 2020. KK submitted that the abatement of rent stems




 
from a large plumbing
project that was completed on the rental
unit in November and
December 2019.
 
2.       
The Landlord’s Representative
submitted that the Tenants brought this issue before the Board in a T6 application which was dismissed. The Landlord’s Representative entered in evidence a
copy of the Board order for the Tenants’ application. This Board order is
TNT-29934-21 issued
on November 1, 2021. In this order,
the Member found no merits to the Tenants’ allegation that the
Landlord failed to meet their maintenance obligation with respect to the
plumbing project. The Member
dismissed the Tenants’ application and no rent abatement was order.
 
3.       
I am satisfied that the issue of
abatement of rent for the plumbing project has been already adjudicated by the
Board in order TNT-29934-21. The Member who heard the Tenants’ application on
this issue, dismissed the application. Because
this issue has already been determined by the Board, I am precluded to make
another finding on the same issue because of the principles of res judicata.        If
the Tenants were not satisfied with the outcome
in the Board order TNT-29934-21, they should have sought appropriate remedies (file a request to
review order TNT-29934-21 or file an appeal of that order), and not try to
reargue the merits on this review request.
 
4.       
Despite my finding, the Landlord’s
Representative conceded that there was in fact an error in the calculations of
arrears of rent in the order because the order did not include the deduction
for the last month’s rent deposit. As
such, the Tenant’s request to review the order is granted on the basis that the
order failed to deduct from the arrears of rent the last month’s rent deposit being held by the Landlord, and any interest
incurred on the last month’s rent deposit.
 
New Hearing of the Landlord’s L1 Application
 
5.       
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from April 5, 2020 to February 4,
2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective May 6, 2020.
 
6.       
The Tenants were in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
7.       
The lawful monthly rent was $2,100.00.
 
8.       
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,100.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
9.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenants for the period from June 2, 2019 to May 6, 2020.
 
10.    The Tenants paid $5,500.00 after the application was filed.
 
11.   
The arrears of rent owed to the Landlord
is $10,528.12, less the last month’s rent deposit
and the interest owing on the last month’s rent deposit.




 
12.   
KK submitted that the Tenants require
until January 2024 to repay the Landlord
the arrears of rent.
 
13.    I have considered the Tenants’ request for additional
time to pay the arrears of rent before interest starts to incur, and given the
amount owed, I find it reasonable to delay the date interest starts incurring
by 6 months. I do not find it
reasonable to expect the Landlord to
wait 2 years. This would
not be just, or fair given the fact the Tenants
have had since April 2020, the date arrears of rent started to accumulate, to start paying the
amount owed to the Landlord.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The Tenants’ request to review is granted.
 
2.       
Order TNL-27494-20 issued on October 21, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the
following:
 
3.       
The tenancy is terminated as of February
4, 2021, the date the Tenants gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
4.       
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $8,384.00*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 4, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit.
 
5.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.       
If the Tenants do not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing on or before July 7, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from July 8, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
