Properties LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Nguyen Huu Thang (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay
the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 20, 2022. Only

1.     
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to November
30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 24, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on November
2, 2021. The Tenant was in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.      The lawful monthly
rent was $1,073.10.
 
4.      The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,076.92 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021
to September 24, 2021.
