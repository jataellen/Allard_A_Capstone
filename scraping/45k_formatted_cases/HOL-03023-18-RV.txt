Review
Order
 
Q.C. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict M.P. and P.S. (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe. At
the hearing pursuant to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act') the Tenants applied for an order determining that the Landlord or the
Landlord’s agent substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the
rental unit or residential complex by the Tenants or by a member of the Tenants
household and for an order determining that the Landlord failed to meet the
Landlord's maintenance obligations or failed to comply with health, safety,
housing or maintenance standards.
 
This application was resolved by order
HOL-03023-18 issued on July 23, 2018.
 
On August 30, 2018, the Landlord requested
a review of the order.
 
The request was heard in Whitby on
September 26, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s agent, M.Y.,
and the second-named Tenant above attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
THE REVIEW
REQUEST
1.     
The Tenants consent to the
Landlord’s request for review. They agree that the original order contains a
material error of fact with respect to the amount of rent arrears owing. As a
result, order HOL-03023-18 issued on July 23, 2018
shall be cancelled.


THE APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF
RENT
2.     
There is no dispute between
the parties that the Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to
pay for the period from March 10, 2018 to October 9, 2018.  Because of the
arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective June 22, 2018.
3.     
The Tenants paid $7,000.00
after the application was filed. As a result, the arrears of rent owing as of
the date of the review hearing total $3,700.00 for the period ending October 9,
2018.
4.     
The Landlord incurred costs
of $175.00 for filing the application and is entitled to reimbursement of those
costs.
5.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $2,100.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from June 12, 2018 to June 22, 2018
totaling $1.24.
THE TENANTS’
SECTION 82 CLAIMS
7.     
The Tenants assert two
claims by way of section 82. They allege:
•       
The Landlord has
substantially interfered with their reasonable enjoyment by storing possessions
in the rental unit without consent; and
•       
The exhaust fan in the
kitchen is in a state of disrepair. 
8.     
This tenancy began in June
of 2017. The rental unit is the entirety of a single family home. 
9.     
When the Tenants moved in
they found a number of items on the property that were left behind by the
Landlord. The Tenant who attended the hearing says a washing machine was left
at the interior entrance to the garage; about 45% of the basement was locked so
the Tenants did not have access; in the basement there was a table and two
chairs and old items by the furnace; and in the garage there were logs, a lawn
mower trimmer, and boxes on the shelving. 
10.   On June 20, 2017 the Tenants sent a text saying:
We requested
the washer on the main floor to be removed on day we came to sign the paperwork
on site. Also there are sandles (sic) and cleaning stuffs left in the main
floor what would you like to do with this?
11.   The Landlord’s Agent says that there was an oral
agreement at the beginning of the tenancy that the Landlord could use a storage
room in the basement. The Tenant present at the hearing says that is not true. 
12.   But the texts exchanged immediately after the
Tenants’ June 20, 2017 text quoted above say:
Landlord’s
Agent: Will you mover able to help the landlord to move it to the basement? If
not. I will ask landlord to send someone to move it.
Tenant(s): I
will ask the movers but if they ask me extra money?
Landlord’s
Agent: Let me know how much. And landlord will decide
…
Landlord’s
Agent: She say she will come to move it next month when she comeback from
Quebec. And for everything else. Please pack it and leave in the bsmt. 
13.   In subsequent texts the parties agree to dates
and times when the Landlord can attend the rental unit to collect toys from the
basement. 
14.   The texts in June of 2017 with their discussion
about the Tenants moving the Landlord’s possessions into the basement, support
the assertion of the Landlord’s Agent that there was an oral agreement between
the parties that a portion of the basement could be used by the Landlord for
storage. So I am satisfied that the tenancy agreement includes an agreement the
Landlord can use the locked room in the basement for storage. 
15.   That being said, the washing machine was never
moved and no evidence was led that indicates the Tenants agreed to have only
partial use of the garage.
16.   As a result, I am satisfied that the Landlord
has been storing personal items in the rental unit (namely, the washing
machine) and in the garage without the Tenants’ consent. 
17.   Because of the items in the garage, the Tenant
says he can only park one car instead of two cars and the second has to be
parked outside in the driveway. The washing machine sits in the interior of the
house near the inner entrance to the garage so it is not available for the
Tenants to use for common items like shoes. Because the basement is partially
in use for storage for the Landlord’s belongings, the Tenants are using the
garage for their own items. This testimony by the Tenant was not rebutted in
any way. 
18.   Therefore, I am satisfied that the Landlord’s
failure to remove the washing machine and the personal items in the garage
substantially interfered with the Tenants’ reasonable enjoyment. 
19.   The Tenants seek abatement of the rent in the
amount of $150.00 per month since June of 2017. The Tenant at the hearing
stated that this amount represents the approximate cost of a small storage
unit. That assertion was also not rebutted by the Landlord and seems to me to
be a reasonable estimate of the value of a small storage unit commercially
available. 
20.   This application was filed with the Board on
June 24, 2018 which means the limit of the Board’s jurisdiction with respect to
the Tenants’ claims begins on June 24, 2018. As a result, an order will issue
granting abatement of the rent in the amount of $150.00 per month from the
period starting June 24, 2017 and ongoing until the Landlord removes all of her
personal items from the rental unit including the garage save and except for
the locked storage room in the basement. 
21.   For the period June 24, 2017 to September 24,
2018 the abatement owing is $150.00 x 15 months = $2,250.00. The Landlord will
also be ordered to pay $4.93 per day for each day the possessions remain in the
rental unit. That means for the period ending the day of the hearing of the
review before me the amount owing is $2,259.86. This amount shall be offset against
the rent arrears owing. 
22.   The Tenant says the exhaust fan over the oven
does not vent properly to the outside. He says he complained about it to the
Landlord in November of 2017 but nothing was done. The issue was raised again
at the previous hearing of this application on July 16, 2018. Instead of
addressing the issue, the Landlord instructed the Tenant to contact an
appliance company which the Tenants did. They told the Tenants they do not
service the exhaust fan. 
23.   The Tenant also says this has impacted them with
respect to their “cooking style” meaning the timing of when cooking is done.
For example, it will be done in the morning with the windows open and the fan
in the bathroom on. 
24.   As the Landlord does not dispute any the
Tenants’ evidence with respect to the exhaust fan in the kitchen, I accept the
Tenants’ evidence in its entirety and find that the Landlord is in breach of
her obligations under s. 20(1) of the Act. The exhaust fan is not in a good
state of repair. 
25.   The Tenants seek as remedies an order requiring
the Landlord to effect repair and authorisation to do repairs themselves and deduct
the cost from the rent if the Landlord does not repair the exhaust fan in a
timely manner. In response to my question, the Tenant present stated the Tenants
are not seeking abatement of the rent with respect to the exhaust fan. 
26.   The Tenants’ requests with respect to remedy are
reasonable and an order shall issue accordingly. 
27.   Finally, at the hearing of the review the Tenant
present mentioned another issue that could be the subject of a claim pursuant
to s. 82 of the Act involving the roof. In response to my questions, the Tenant
present conceded the Landlord had no notice that any claim would be made
pursuant to s. 82 with respect to the roof. The Landlord’s Agent was not
prepared to proceed with the hearing of that issue so the Tenant was offered
the choice of an adjournment or proceeding by way of a separate application
filed by the Tenants at another time. The Tenant present elected not to include
the roof issue in the Tenants’ section 82 claims. 


RELIEF FROM
EVICTION
28.   I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
the Act beyond the Board’s standard voidable eleven day pay and stay order. Initially
the Tenants requested a repayment plan but after asking the Tenant present for
a repayment plan he stated the entirety of the rent arrears could be paid by
e-transfers within eight days of the hearing. In other words, the Tenants can
pay the outstanding rent within the Board’s standard eleven day voiding period and
do not need further relief. 
29.   I would also observe for the sake of
completeness that the breaches of the Act found above do not constitute a “serious
breach” of the Landlord’s obligations as that term is used in s. 83(3)(a) of
the Act. Mandatory relief from eviction is not warranted. The Landlord is
entitled to the order sought. 
30.   This order contains all of the reasons for the
decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued. 
It is ordered that:
1.     
Order HOL-03023-18 issued on
July 23, 2018 is cancelled and replaced by the following: 
2.     
Unless the Tenants void the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before November
4, 2018.
3.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $397.39* less any amount paid to the Landlord by the Tenants after
September 26, 2018. This amount represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to October 24, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit and less the amount of the abatement the
Landlord owes the Tenants for the period ending September 26, 2018.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $69.04 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting October 25, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
5.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
6.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before November 4, 2018, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
November 5, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
7.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before November 4, 2018, then starting November 5, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
8.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after November 5, 2018.
9.     
If, on or before November 4,
2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $3,715.14** (less any amount paid to the
Landlord by the Tenants after September 26, 2018) to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
10.   The Tenants are entitled to deduct from the
amount owing under paragraph 3 or 9 of this order $4.93 per day starting
September 27, 2018 until the Landlord removes her personal items from the
rental unit including the garage save and except for the locked storage room in
the basement. 
11.   The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after November 5, 2018 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
12.   The Landlord shall forthwith repair the exhaust
fan in the kitchen. 
13.   If the Landlord does not comply with paragraph
11 of this order by October 31, 2018 then the Tenants are authorised to hire a
contractor to repair the exhaust fan and may deduct the cost of doing so from
the rent provided the Tenants give to the Landlord proof of payment and the
contact information for the contractor in question.
