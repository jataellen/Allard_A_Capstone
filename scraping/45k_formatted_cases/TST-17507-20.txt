Order under Section

Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TST-17507-20
 
 



In the
  matter of:


2, 471 QUEEN
STREET E TORONTO ON M5A1T9


 




Between:


Simon Ioia Laura
Fremont


Tenants




 


 
and


 




 


Brad J. Lamb Realty Inc. Brad Lamb


Landlords



 
 
Simon Ioia and Laura Fremont (the 'Tenants') applied
for an order determining that Brad Lamb and Brad J. Lamb Realty Inc. (the 'Landlords') substantially interfered with
the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the
Tenants or by a member of their household.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on October 26, 2021.
 
Only the Tenants attended
the hearing. The Landlord was not present
or represented at the
hearing although properly notified of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants
filed this application alleging that the Landlord substantially interfered with the
Tenant’s reasonable enjoyment by failing to secure the residential complex and
permitting squatter’s unimpeded access.
 
2.    
It was uncontested that
the Tenants had notified the Landlords representative Chris Howcroft of the
presence of squatters in the residential complex and advised of a prior fire
caused by the squatters. The Tenants
also advised Krystal Bedard of the squatters and expressed how unsafe
they felt particularly given that they had a 10-month-old child and due to the inaction of the Landlord.
 
3.    
The Tenants
left the unit on March
26, 2020. They arranged for their possessions to be packed and
removed on April 25, 2020.
 
4.     The residential complex
was subsequently consumed
by fire on June 2, 2020.
 
5.     The Tenants are seeking their last months
rent deposit and moving expenses.




File Number: TST-17507-20
 
6.    
I am satisfied by the
uncontested evidence that the Landlord failed to investigate and resolve the
Tenant’s complaints about security and the presence of squatters in the
building. Therefore, I find that the
Landlords substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental
unit or residential complex by the Tenants
or by a member of their
household.
 
7.    
I find that the Tenants moved out of the rental
unit because of the Landlords' in-actions.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord shall pay to the Tenant
$2,900.00 which is the last months rent deposit.
 
2.    
The Landlords
shall pay to the Tenants
$1,017.00 which is the reasonable out of pocket expenses the Tenants have incurred
for moving expenses.
 
3.     The Landlords shall also pay to the Tenants $48.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.     The total amount
the Landlords owe is $3,965.00.
 
5.     The Landlords shall pay the Tenants the full amount owing by January 16,
2022.
 
6.    
If the Landlords do not pay the Tenants
the full amount
owing by January
16, 2022, they will owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
