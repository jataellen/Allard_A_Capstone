Kristen McNeill Shane McNeill


Tenants




 
On November 22, 2021, Khanna Holdings
Inc (the 'Landlord') applied in this L4 application for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Kristen McNeill and Shane McNeill (the
'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because
the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified
in the consent order
issued by the Board on November 17, 2021
with respect to L1
application TEL-19966-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The previous consent order
provided that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants did not meet
certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenants have not met the following condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenants failed
to pay to the Landlord
$1,200.00 on or before November
1, 2021 towards rent. This
was a breach of paragraph 2 of the consent order. This L4 application was filed
within 30 days of the breach.
 
3.       
The previous L1 application included a request
for an order for the payment
of arrears of rent.
The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or
some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, in this L4
application the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenants agreed to pay
$2,986.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's L1
application fee in the previous consent order TEL-19966-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $1,236.00 and that amount
is included in this order. As
a result, the previous order TEL-19966-21 is cancelled.
 
5.       
On October 15, 2021 the Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,200.00 from the
Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.




 
6.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenants for the period from October 15, 2021
to January 11, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The previous consent order
TEL-19966-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move
out of the rental unit on or before January
22, 2022 (standard 11 days from the
issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $1,235.57*. This amount represents the rent owing up to November 30, 2021 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous L1 application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$39.45 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting December 1, 2021 to the date the
Tenants actually move out of the rental unit or gets evicted.
 
5.       
If the Tenants do not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing*
on or before January 22, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest.
This will be simple
interest calculated from January 23, 2022 at 2.00% annually
on the balance outstanding.
 
6.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 22, 2022, then starting January
23, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after January 23, 2022.

The tenant has until January 21, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 21, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating

has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
