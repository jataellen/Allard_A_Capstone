Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24569-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


3, 78 GENEVA
STREET
ST. CATHARINES ON L2R4M8


 




Between:


1546921 Ontario Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Michael
Calder


Tenant



 
 
 
1546921 Ontario
Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Michael Calder (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or a person
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has seriously impaired the
safety of any person. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 956 0593 7653#
on January 5, 2022.
 
Only the
Landlord’s Representative, Anthony Corso and the Landlord, Alex Genzer attended
the hearing. Mary Nichols (MN), Disclosure Clerk for Niagara Regional Police
Services, as witness also attended the hearing. The Board properly
serviced the Tenant
with Notice and the Landlord’s
Representative stated he disclosed evidence via email to the Tenant on December
28, 2021 that included the date and time of the hearing. I am satisfied the
Tenant received adequate Notice of this hearing.
T
Determinations:
 
1.    
On September 1, 2021,
the Tenant assaulted another person in the residential complex with a knife. MN
confirmed police charged the Tenant with aggravated assault and possession of illegal weapon.
I find the Tenant has seriously impaired the safety
of other persons and this act
or omission occurred in the residential complex.
 
2.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
January 16, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 16, 2022.




File Number: SOL-24569-21
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January
17, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.    
Upon receipt of this
order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 17, 2022. The Sheriff is requested to expedite the enforcement
of this order.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act,

with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction
where the rental unit is located.
