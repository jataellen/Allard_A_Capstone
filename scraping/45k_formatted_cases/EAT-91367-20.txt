Tenants

Navinder Khurana


Landlord



 
 
 
Jekaterina Roslakova and Togzhan
Askarova (the 'Tenants') applied
for an order determining that Navinder Khurana (the 'Landlord')
has collected or retained money illegally.
 
This application
was heard by video conference on January 12, 2022. The Tenant, Togzhan Askarova,
and the Landlord
attended the hearing. Determinations:
1.     The Landlord collected $1,000.00 from the Tenants for
a key deposit and retained a portion following termination of the tenancy. The Tenants seek its return.
For the reasons set out below, the Landlord must return the portion key
deposit he retained to the Tenants.
 
2.    
Section 105 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”) provides that the only security deposit
a landlord may collect is a
rent deposit collected in accordance with s.
106. Section 134 prohibits
landlords from collecting a key deposit. However, pursuant to s. 17.3 of O. reg 516/06, it is not illegal for landlords to collect key deposits, provided the deposit is refundable and no
more than the actual replacement cost of the keys.
 
3.     The Landlord acknowledges the Tenants paid $1000.00 for a key deposit. When the
tenancy came to an end the Landlord did not refund the entire key deposit.
 
4.     Instead, the Landlord came to an agreement with the
Tenant, Jekaterina Roslakova, to use portion of the money to offset damages the
Tenants may have caused to the rental unit.
The Landlord retained
$855 and returned
$145 to Ms. Roslakova by e-mail transfer. In support of the Landlord’s
position a signed agreement by the Landlord and Ms. Roslakova was entered into
evidence. I accept the Landlord’s evidence in this regard. I find the Landlord
returned the $145.00 to Ms. Roslakova.

5.     However, the remaining $855.00 retained by the
Landlord must be returned to the Tenants. A refundable key deposit, as set out in O. reg 516/06 is
permitted under the Act,
however by its terms it must be refunded upon return of the keys. Even where
keys are not returned, the Landlord may only retain the actual replacement cost
of the keys. On the other hand, a “damage deposit” is not allowed under the
Act. By purporting to hold key deposit as a damage deposit, the Landlord
illegally retained money.
 
6.     If the Landlord
wants compensation for damage caused
by the Tenants, he must bring
an applciation on that basis.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord shall
pay to the Tenants the sum of $855.00 This amount represents
$1,000.00 collected as a refundable key deposit, less $145.00 already
returned to the Tenants.
 
2.     The Landlord shall also pay to the Tenants $53.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     The total amount
the Landlord owes to the Tenants is $908.00
 
4.     If the Landlord
does not pay the Tenants
the full amount
owing by February
28, 2022, the Landlord will owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
outstanding balance.
 
5.     The Tenants have the right, at any time, to collect the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
