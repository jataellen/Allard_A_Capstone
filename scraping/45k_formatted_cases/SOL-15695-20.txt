Strategic Growth Realty Group
Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Kyla Sutton (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex
has wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 3, 2021.
Only the Landlord’s representative, J. Ricci, attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant was still in possession of the rental
unit as of the date the application was filed.
 
2.    
The Tenant, an occupant of the
rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the Tenant
has wilfully or negligently caused undue
damage to the rental unit and residential complex
by clogging the toilet with objects like combs, causing
the toilet to leak into the rental unit below.
 
3.     The Landlord has incurred
costs of $1,125.56 to repair the damage.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$1,125.56, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage.
 
2.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
