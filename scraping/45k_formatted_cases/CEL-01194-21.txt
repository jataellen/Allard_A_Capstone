Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-01194-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


8 HARTHILL COURT BRAMPTON ON L7A2N9


 




Between:


Affan Khalid Hassan
Khalid


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Jillian Blake Tanishea Dennis


Tenants



 
 
 
Affan Khalid and Hassan Khalid (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Tanishea
Dennis and Jillian Blake (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
919 0500 4258# on October
14, 2021. The Landlord
Affan Khalid and the Tenant Tanishea Dennis, attended the hearing.
 
Preliminary Matters:
 
At the hearing I informed the parties that I believed
that the served
the N12 notice
in good faith. Having reviewed the evidence
and upon further
reflection, I do not find the notice
was served in good faith for the reasons stated
below.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant claims she did not receive the compensation
that the Landlord is required pay
until after the termination date on the notice. The Tenant points to a Canada Post tracker as evidence showing
that the cheque
was not delivered until September 20, 2021. The
termination date on the notice was August 31, 2021.
 
2.     The Landlord’s evidence
shows the cheque is dated August 15, 2021 and that the cheque was sent by express post on
August 18, 2021.
 
3.     The Residential Tenancies Act requires a
landlord to pay the compensation before the termination date, which the
Landlord did in this case. A landlord
cannot control how long it takes for
the delivery of the cheque, sent by express post, to arrive at its destination. I find the Landlord
made a good faith effort to pay the compensation before the termination




 
date on the notice and that the payment
complies with the requirement and intent of the
Act.
 
4.     The Tenant questions the good faith of the notice and
the Landlord’s intent to move into the unit.
The Tenant introduced several text messages showing that the Landlord
had enquired about the Tenant’s interest in purchasing the house. The Tenant also introduced other text
messages dated June 24, 2021, from the Landlord as evidence dated June 24,
2021. These were five days before the
N12 notice was served. The messages ask the Tenant how the move is
going, and that his real estate
agent will pick up the keys on June 30, 2021. The Tenant responded saying they were not moving
and were still interested in purchasing the house.
 
5.    
Another text from the Landlord tells the Tenant that the lease agreement
ends on June 30, 2021.
 
6.     On June 25, 2021 there is a text from the Landlord
telling the Tenant that they are not interested in a private
sale, that their real estate
agent will contact
her, that the house will go on MLS, and she needs to move out
as soon as possible.
 
7.     The Tenant introduced a text from the Landlord’s real
estate agent, also dated June 25, 2021, informing the Tenant that he is the Landlords’ real estate agent and that the house will be listed on MLS next month.
 
8.     The Landlord’s position is that he and his brother
were going to sell the house, but
when his brother moved to Calgary, his brother purchased a house there and they
no longer needed to sell the house. The
Landlord also testified that he was
required to be present at his place of employment until recently and now that he can work from home and he no longer needs to live close to where he
works. This in the four-day period
between his agent telling the Tenant the house was going on MLS and the notice
being served.
 
9.     Based on the evidence before me, I am not satisfied the Landlord, in good faith, required
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation at the
time the notice was served on the Tenant.
 
10.  The test messages show that the Landlord wanted the
tenancy to end on the date that the tenancy agreement
ended. The Act provides that a tenancy
agreement continues as a month to month tenancy after the term
agreement has expired. Section 37 of
the Act provides that a tenancy can only be terminated in accordance with the
Act and that include a notice that complies with the Act or an agreement to
terminate the tenancy.
 
11.  In this case, it is clear that there was no notice or agreement to terminate the tenancy on June 30, 2021. The Landlord had expected the Tenant to vacate the unit and was
intending to sell the home. The Landlord’s
real estate agent was actively involved in the attempted sale of the home up until four days before
the N12 notice was signed
on June 29, 2021.




 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlords’ application is dismissed.
