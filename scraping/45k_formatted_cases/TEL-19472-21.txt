Order under Section

Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19472-21



In the matter
of:


5, 39 WEST
STREET EAST TRENTON ON
  K8V2L7


 




Between:


Hammad Arif


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Leonard
Ibbotson Valerie Ibbotson


Tenants



 
 
Hammad Arif (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Leonard
Ibbotson and Valerie Ibbotson (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants entered
into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
The matter was sent to a hearing to clarify the conditions contained in the agreement
to terminate.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 8, 2021.
Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants
did not attend
the hearing scheduled for 1 p.m. I waited
until 1:20 p.m.,
and then I proceeded to hear the matter on an uncontested basis.
 
2.    
The Landlord
and the Tenants
signed an agreement to terminate the tenancy as of
October 7, 2021. The Landlord
applied for an ex parte eviction order
based on the agreement.
 
3.    
The Landlord
said that the Tenants moved out on October 7, 2021, and the tenancy terminated on that date. Consequently, the Landlord’s application
is moot.
 
It
is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants terminated on October 7, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
