31, 130 and 135
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNT-12509-19
 
 
 
 
MQ and KF (the
'Tenants') applied for an order
determining that PL and RL (the 'Landlords') have
collected or retained money illegally. T1 Application
 
The Tenants also
applied for an order determining that the Landlords have reduced or
discontinued a service provided in respect of the rental
unit or the residential complex.
T3 Application
 
The Tenants also
applied for an order determining that the Landlords entered their rental unit
illegally, substantially interfered with their reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit, harassed them, and failed to provide them with a
written tenancy agreement for their care home unit. T2 Application
 
The hearing
was held by videoconference on December 9, 2021. One Tenant, MQ, was
present at the hearing. The Landlords
and the Landlords’ representative, RWY, were also present at the hearing.
 
Determinations - T1 Application
 
1.    
On January 11, 2019 the
Tenants applied to the Board, pursuant to s. 135(1) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), with a T1 application (T1) alleging that the
Landlords charged an illegal rent and an illegal fee, and that the Landlords
owe the Tenants interest on the rent deposit and interest on the amount of rent
paid illegally.
 
2.    
The Landlords
allegedly started charging
the illegal rent in April 2018, charged
the illegal deposit on April 10,
2018, and collected the rent deposit of $1600.00 on February 24, 2018. The Tenants filed this application within
one-year of the date that the money was allegedly retained illegally pursuant
to s. 135(4) of the Act.




 
3.    
The Tenants
submitted a written
tenancy application to the Landlord
on March 31, 2018.
An oral tenancy agreement between the Tenants and the Landlord was
established on February 24, 2018. A
written tenancy agreement was never produced or signed for this tenancy. The Tenants paid the Landlords a rent
deposit of $1600.00 on February 24, 2018, and moved into the rental unit on
April 1, 2018. The Tenants vacated
the rental unit 16 months later on July 31, 2019.
 
Illegal Rent
 
4.    
The Tenant testified that the legal
rent for her rental unit over her period
of tenancy was
$1600.00 per
month. The Tenant testified further
that the Landlords charged her an additional
$35.00 in rent for the month
of April 2018, $100.00 extra
in monthly rent for the months of May, June, July and October 2018, an additional $250.00
in rent for the month
of August 2018, and an additional $200.00
in rent for the month of September
2018. The Tenant stated that
these additional charges were the result of added utility expenses incurred by
the Landlords when the Tenant had additional occupants living in the rental
unit. The Tenant stated further that
utilities were included in the $1600.00 monthly rent as per her oral tenancy
agreement with the Landlords.
 
5.    
The Landlords’
representative submitted that the Landlords acknowledge that they charged the Tenants an illegal rent in the amount of $885.00 over the period
of April to October 2018. The Landlords agreed to refund the $885.00 to the Tenants.
 
6.    
Section 134(1)
of the Act states:
 
Unless otherwise
prescribed, no landlord
shall, directly or indirectly, with respect to any rental unit,
 
(a)  
collect or require or
attempt to collect or require from a tenant, prospective tenant or former
tenant of the rental unit a fee, premium, commission, bonus, penalty, key deposit or other like amount of money whether
or not the money is refundable;
 
7.    
On the basis of the
evidence provided, I am satisfied that over the period of April to October 2018 the Landlords
collected from the Tenants an additional fee of $885.00
for utility expenses even though these utility expenses
were included in the monthly
rent of
$1600.00. Therefore, I find that the Landlords’
collection of this $885.00 fee was contrary
to s. 134(1)(a) of the Act and does not fall within any of the exceptions contained in s. 17 of Ontario Regulation
516/06.
 
Illegal Rent Deposit
 
8.    
The Tenant
testified that on April 10, 2018 the Landlords required
her to pay an extra
$100.00 for a rent deposit even though she had already
paid a rent deposit of $1600.00
on February 24, 2018 that was equivalent to one month’s rent.
 
9.    
The Landlords’
representative submitted that the Landlords acknowledge that they charged the Tenants an illegal rent deposit of $100.00 more than the monthly rent of
$1600.00. The Landlords agreed
to refund the $100.00 to the Tenants.




 
10. 
Section 106(2)
of the Act states:
 
The amount of a rent deposit
shall not be more than the lesser of the amount of rent
for one rent period and the amount of rent for one month. 2006, c. 17, s. 106 (2).
 
11.  On the basis
of the evidence provided, I am satisfied
that on April 10, 2018 the Landlords
collected from the Tenants a $100.00 rent deposit, in additional to the
$1600.00 rent deposit that the Landlords collected from the Tenants on February
24, 2018. The
$1700.00 rent
deposit exceeds the $1600.00 monthly rent. Therefore,
I find that the Landlords’ collection of an additional $100.00 rent deposit
from the Tenants
was contrary to s. 106(2) of
the Act.
 
Rent Deposit Interest
and Illegal Rent Interest
 
12.  The Tenant testified that the Landlords owed her interest
in the amount of $170.67
on the rent deposit. She stated that she calculated this interest
using a rent deposit of $1600.00
for the 16-month period of her tenancy at a market adjusted interest rate of
8.0%. The Tenant testified further
that the Landlords also owe her interest on the illegal rent and deposit they charged
her. The Tenant requested interest
be paid to her on the illegal
rent and deposit for a 12-month period at a market adjusted interest
rate of 8.0% - for a total of $254.66.
 
13.  The Landlords’ representative submitted that the Landlords acknowledge that interest is owing on the $1600.00 rent deposit for
the 16-month tenancy; however, the representative added that the interest rate
should be 1.8% pursuant to s. 106(6) of the Act. The Landlord’s representative noted that there is no provision
in the Act for the Tenant to be paid interest on the illegal rent at a market
adjusted interest rate.
 
14.  Section 106(6) of the Act states:
 
A landlord of a
rental unit shall pay interest to the tenant annually on the amount of the rent deposit at a rate equal to the guideline
determined under section
120 that is in effect at the time payment becomes
due. 2006, c. 17, s. 106 (6).
 
15.  The guideline interest rate in 2018 and
2019 pursuant to s. 120 of the Act was 1.8%. Therefore, it is this interest
rate, not a market adjusted interest rate, that must be used when calculating
the interest owed to the Tenants on their rent deposit.                                                                                                                   On the basis of the evidence provided, I am satisfied that the Landlords retained a rent deposit from the Tenants of $1600.00 from
February 24, 2018 to April 9, 2018 – generating interest of
$3.55 using
an interest rate of 1.8%. I am also satisfied that the Landlords retained a rent deposit from the Tenants of $1700.00
from April 10, 2018 to July 31, 2019 – generating interest of $39.99 using an
interest rate of 1.8%. Therefore, I
find that the Landlords owe the Tenants a total of $43.54 in rent deposit
interest pursuant to s. 106(6) of the Act.
 
16.  I accept that there is no provision in s.
135(1) the Act for the Landlords to pay the Tenants interest, at a market
adjusted rate, for any money collected and retained in contravention of the
Act. As such, I find that the
Tenants’ request to receive 8.0% interest on the illegal rent of $885.00
charged over the period of April to October 2018 is
not pursuant to s. 135(1). The
Tenants’ request is therefore denied.




 
Determinations – T3 Application
 
17.  On January 11, 2019 the Tenants applied to
the Board, pursuant to s. 130(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), with a T3 application (T3)
alleging that the Landlords discontinued internet service and reduced driveway
snow removal services.
 
18. 
Section 130(1)
of the Act states:
 
A tenant of a rental
unit may apply to the Board for an order for a reduction of the
rent charged for the rental unit due to a reduction or discontinuance in services or facilities provided in respect of the rental unit or the
residential complex. 2006, c. 17, s.
130(1).
 
19.  The Landlords allegedly discontinued
internet service on June 10, 2018, and reduced snow removal services in April 2018. The Tenants
filed this application within one-year of the date that these services were
allegedly discontinued and reduced pursuant to s. 130(5).
 
Internet Service
 
20.  The Tenant testified that the provision of
internet service by the Landlords was included in their oral tenancy agreement
on February 24, 2018; however, the internet service for the rental unit stopped
on June 10, 2018. The Tenant
testified further that after attempting to resolve the service interruption
herself, she advised the Landlords of the problem on June 12, 2018. The Landlords responded to the Tenant the
same day, and attended the unit on June 13, 2018
in an attempt to resolve
the issue – without success. The
Tenant stated that on the advice of the Landlord, and her own requirement for
immediate internet access, she arranged and paid for her own internet service
on June 14, 2018. The Tenant
submitted a text message, dated June 14, 2018, advising the Landlord that the Landlord
may cancel the Landlords’ provided
internet service when the
contract ends, and that the Tenant will pay for her own internet service. The Tenant stated further that the Landlords’
internet service never resumed operation. The
original username and password did not work after the repairs to the router.
 
21.  The Landlords acknowledged that the
provision of internet service to the rental unit was their responsibility in
accordance with the oral tenancy agreement. The
Landlords testified that they received a call from the Tenant on June 12, 2018
regarding internet problems, and they attended the unit on June 13, 2018 to
investigate the problem. The
Landlords stated that the internet router required repair, and after its
repair, the internet service for the rental unit was once again operational by
mid-June 2018. The Landlords noted that they never disconnected the internet service,
never refused to provide internet service to the Tenants, and never
changed the username and password for internet access after the router was
repaired.
 
22.  On the basis of the evidence provided, I am
satisfied that the internet service for the rental unit stopped on June 10,
2018, and that the Landlords responded promptly by attending the unit on June 13, 2018, a day after being contacted by the Tenant.
I am also satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the
Landlords’ internet service resumed operation in mid-June 2018. I accept that internet service was vital
for the Tenant, and




 
the Tenant
therefore secured her own internet service on June 14, 2018 before the
Landlords were able to repair their internet router. Although the Landlords’ internet service was unavailable for several days, their response
and ultimate resolution of the problem was
timely and reasonable.
 
23.  I find that the Tenant did not provide the
Landlords with sufficient time to rectify the discontinued service before she
elected to purchase her own internet service.
I accept that the Tenant
had problems logging onto the Landlords’ internet service, after
the router was repaired in
mid-June 2018; however, no evidence was provided that the Tenant pursued the
Landlord to rectify her log-in issues. I
find that the Tenant elected to continue using, and paying for, her own internet service for the remainder of
her tenancy, despite the availability of the Landlords’ internet service by
mid-June 2018. Therefore, the Tenant’s
request for a reduction of rent due to discontinued internet services pursuant to s. 130(1) of the Act is
denied.
 
Snow Removal Services
 
24.  The Tenant testified that the provision of
snow removal services was a Landlord responsibility in accordance with the oral
tenancy agreement she established with the Landlords. She testified further that she first noticed a reduction in snow
removal services in mid-April
2018; however, she never advised
the Landlords about her concerns for the remainder of 2018. The Tenant stated
that she first
advised the Landlords about a
reduction in snow removal services on January 1, 2019, and that the Landlords
responded positively, saying they would check; however, the snow removal
services never improved. The Tenant
testified that she never advised the Landlords again about her snow removal
concerns.
 
25.  The Landlords testified that they maintained a contract for snow removal
services for the residential complex. The Landlords stated that they only
received one complaint about the service from the Tenant, and that they
immediately spoke to the snow removal company about this complaint. The Landlords noted that they never
received another complaint from the Tenant on this issue, and therefore
believed that the snow removal services were acceptable for the Tenant.
 
26.  On the basis of the evidence provided, I am
satisfied that the Landlords provided snow removal services for the residential complex;
however, this service
was not acceptable to the Tenant. I am
also satisfied that the Tenant only complained to the Landlords once about the
level of snow removal services, and that the Landlords responded immediately to
this complaint. I find that without further
complaints from the Tenant about snow removal, it was reasonable for the
Landlords to believe that the service was adequate and satisfactory to the
Tenant. No specific evidence was
provided that the degree of snow removal services provided by the Landlords was
in breach of their oral tenancy agreement with the Tenants. Therefore, the Tenant’s request for a
reduction of rent due to reduced snow removal services pursuant to s. 130(1) of
the Act is denied.
 
Determinations - T2 Application
 
27.  On January 11, 2019, the Tenants filed a T2 application (T2) pursuant to s. 29(1)
of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') alleging
the Landlords illegally entered the




 
rental unit,
substantially interfered with their reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit,
harassed them, and provided no written tenancy agreement for their care-home. I am satisfied that the allegations of illegal entry, substantial interference and harassment can be considered as they occurred less
than one year before the application was filed, pursuant to s. 29(2) of the
Act.
 
28.  The Tenants rental unit is not a care home;
therefore, the Tenants’ allegation of not having a written tenancy
agreement for their
care-home, pursuant to s. 139(1)
of the Act, will not be considered.
 
29.  The residential complex at XX EA in North
York is a single detached bungalow with two rental units – a lower level unit in the basement, and an upper
level unit on the main floor. The
Tenants rented the upper level unit.
 
Illegal Entry
 
30. 
The Tenant testified
that the Landlords entered her rental unit illegally on the following dates in 2018 - in April,
May 7, August 15, September
26, November 1, and December 20.
 
31.  Section 25 of the Act states:
 
A landlord
may enter a rental unit only in accordance with section 26 or 27.
 
April 2018
 
32.  The Tenant testified that the Landlord
entered her rental unit illegally in April 2018. The Tenant noted that the Landlord asked her about an air
mattress in the living room that was being used by the Tenant’s visiting
mother. The Tenant
contended that the only way the
Landlord would have this information is if she had entered
the rental unit. The Tenant did not provide witness,
photographic or video evidence of the Landlord’s alleged illegal entry.
 
33.  The Landlord testified that the Tenant
advised her via text message on March 4, 2018 about her visiting mother who would need an extra bed. The Landlord
submitted this text message. The
Landlord added that it was through this text message that she became informed about
the Tenant’s mother’s
bed in the rental unit. The Landlord
added that she often asks tenants about the status
of visitors and new occupants in rental units for insurance and fire code
compliance purposes of the residential complex. The Landlord testified that she never attended the property in
April 2018.
 
34.  On the basis
of the evidence provided, I am
satisfied that the Landlord’s knowledge of the Tenant’s
mother’s bed in the rental unit was not derived as a result of an illegal entry
into the rental unit. I therefore
find that the Tenants have not established that the Landlords breached
the Tenants’ privacy through an illegal entry of the rental unit in
contravention of s. 25 of the Act.




 
May 7, 2018
 
35.  The Tenant testified that the Landlords entered
the rental unit illegally on May 7, 2018. The
Tenant submitted text messages from May 7, 2018 from the Landlord
inquiring about a bag of
garbage that was left on the front porch of the residential complex. The Tenant contended that the only way the
Landlord would have this information is if the Landlord had entered the rental
unit illegally. The Tenant
acknowledged that the Landlords routinely attended the residential complex to
perform exterior maintenance and lawn cutting.
 
36.  The Landlords stated that they performed
routine maintenance, to include lawn care, on the outside of the rental unit. This routine
service provided to the Tenants
was accepted by the Tenants
and never deemed to require a notice of entry.
The Landlords testified further that the Tenants never advised that the
Landlords’ maintenance work on the outside property of the rental unit required
a notice of entry.
 
37.  The Landlord testified
that a neighbour of the residential complex
had called her on May 7, 2018 about a bag of garbage on the
front porch of the residential complex. The
Landlord stated that she and her husband attended the residential complex on
May 7, 2018, without notice to the Tenants, to remove the garbage, but they
never entered the rental unit.
 
38.  On the basis of the evidence provided, I am
satisfied that the Landlords entered the residential complex on May 7,
2018 to remove a bag of garbage from the front porch of the property; however,
the Landlords did not enter the upper level rental unit at the residential
complex. I am also satisfied that the
Tenants accepted the Landlords’ routine presence at the residential complex to
perform maintenance and lawn care tasks, and that the Tenants did not, on or before
May 7, 2018, advise the Landlords of their objection to the performance of these
maintenance tasks. Without a written
tenancy agreement to dictate otherwise, I am satisfied that the front porch of
the property is a portion of the residential complex, similar to the lawn and
driveway, and thus within the scope of the Landlords’ mutually accepted
responsibilities for the maintenance of the residential complex. I am also satisfied that the Landlords
acted reasonably, given their duties
at the residential complex, to
remove the garbage from the front porch of the property. I therefore find that the Tenants have not established
that the Landlords breached the
Tenants’ privacy
through an illegal
entry of the rental unit in
contravention of s. 25 of the
Act.
 
August 15, 2018
 
39.  The Tenant testified
that the Landlord entered the rental unit illegally on August 15, 2018. The Tenant
submitted a text message from the Landlord from August 15, 2018. In the message the Landlord asks the
Tenant about a white powder substance in front of the porch next to the plant. The Tenant contended that the only way the
Landlord would have this information is if the Landlord had entered the rental
unit illegally. She added that this
white powder could not be seen from the sidewalk in front of the property.
 
40.  The Landlords testified that on August 15,
2018 they attended the property to cut the lawn. When they removed
the lawn mower
from the front porch they then noticed
the




 
white powder
substance in front of the porch – prompting their communication to the Tenant. The Landlords testified
that they did not enter the rental
unit on August
15, 2018.
 
41.  On the basis of the evidence provided, I am
satisfied that the Landlords entered the residential complex on August 15, 2018 to mow the lawn; however, the Landlords did not
enter the upper level rental unit at the residential complex. I am also satisfied that the
Tenants accepted
the Landlords’ routine lawn maintenance at the property and did not, on or
before August 15, 2018, object to the Landlords about this lawn cutting. I am satisfied that the front porch
of the property is a portion of the residential complex, similar to the lawn and driveway, and thus within the
scope of the Landlords’ mutually accepted responsibilities for the maintenance
of the residential complex. I am also
satisfied that the Landlords acted reasonably, given their duties at the
residential complex, to remove the lawn mower
from the front porch
of the property to mow the lawn. I therefore find that
the Tenants have not established that the Landlords breached the Tenants’
privacy through an illegal entry of the rental unit in contravention of s. 25
of the Act.
 
September 26, 2018
 
42.  The Tenant testified that the Landlord
entered the rental unit illegally on September 26, 2018. The Tenant submitted a text message from the Landlord from
September 26, 2018. In the message
the Landlord asks the Tenant about the status of the smoke and carbon monoxide
detector in the bedroom hallway. The
Tenant stated that she had disabled the smoke and carbon monoxide detector a
few days earlier as a result of smoke in the kitchen; however, she noted that
the only way the Landlord would have been aware of this is if the Landlord had entered the rental unit illegally
– without notice. The Tenant did not provide witness, photographic or video
evidence of the Landlord’s alleged illegal entry.
 
43.  The Landlord testified that she did not
enter the rental unit on September 26, 2018, but rather, she entered the rental
unit legally, with notice to the Tenant, on September 17, 2018. The Landlord submitted a text message sent
to the Tenant on September 16, 2018 providing 24-hour notice to the Tenant to
enter the rental unit on September 17, 2018 to repair the bathroom toilet. This repair was based on a text message
maintenance request from the Tenant
dated September 15, 2018. The Landlord testified that it was on September 17,
2018 that she noticed the disabled smoke and carbon monoxide detector, but she
did not advise the Tenant about this issue until September 26, 2018 – via text
message. The Tenant acknowledged that
the Landlord’s entry into the rental unit on September 17, 2018 was approved by
her.
 
44.  On the basis of the evidence provided,
I am satisfied that the Landlord’s knowledge
of the disabled smoke and
carbon monoxide detector was not derived as a result of an illegal entry into the rental
unit on September 26, 2018, but rather as a result
of a legal entry into the unit on September 17, 2018. I therefore find that the Tenants have not
established that the Landlords
breached the Tenants’ privacy through
an illegal entry of the rental unit in contravention of s. 25 of the
Act.




 
November 1, 2018
 
45.  The Tenant testified that the Landlord
entered her rental unit illegally on November 1, 2018. The Tenant noted that the Landlord asked her, in a text message dated
November 1, 2018, about a pile of sand on the property that was
attracting ants. The Tenant submitted
this text message. The Tenant stated
that the only way the Landlord would have this information about the sand is if
she had entered the rental unit illegally. The
Tenant did not provide witness, photographic or video evidence of the
Landlord’s alleged illegal entry.
 
46.  The Landlord testified that she was not at
the residential complex or in the rental unit on November 1, 2018. The Landlord stated
that her text to the Tenant on November 1, 2018 was in
relation to the white powder that she discovered near the front porch on August 15, 2018, and was only prompted to advise
the Tenants as a result of complaints from neighbours that the white powder /
sand was now attracting ants on both properties.
 
47.  On the basis
of the evidence provided, I am satisfied
that the Landlord’s knowledge of the white powder / sand was not derived
as a result of an illegal entry into the rental unit on November 1, 2018, but
rather from a lawn mowing visit to the residential complex on August 15, 2018. I therefore find that the Tenants have not
established that the Landlords breached the Tenants’ privacy through an illegal
entry of the rental unit in contravention of s. 25 of the Act.
 
December 20, 2018
 
48.  The Tenant testified that the Landlord
entered her rental unit illegally on December 20, 2018 by arriving at her front
door, without notice,
to talk about an N11 Agreement to End the Tenancy. The Tenant stated that the Landlord never
advised her, in advance of the visit, that the Landlord would be visiting the
rental unit on December 20, 2018. The
Tenant also disputes having a telephone conversation with the Landlord about
the visit, or the tenancy, on December 19, 2018.
 
49.  The Landlord testified that the Tenant
called her on December 19, 2018 requesting rent receipts, and the Landlord
then advised the Tenant that she would be at the rental
unit on the evening of
December 20, 2018 to talk about rent payments.
The Landlord submitted a text message from the Tenant dated December 20,
2018 at 8:11 am. In the message that
Tenant suggests to the Landlord that they talk face-to-face to talk about the
rent receipts and a copy of the rental agreement. The Landlord testified further that she accepted this text
message from the Tenant as the Tenant’s consent to attend to the rental unit.
 
50.  The Landlord stated that she arrived at the
rental unit at 7:50 pm on December 20, 2018 and had a discussion with the
Tenant at the front door, and at no time did she enter the rental unit. The Landlord noted that the Tenant did not
want to talk about the N11, and requested that it be left in the mailbox. The Landlord stated further that she left
the N11 in the mailbox as instructed, departed the residential complex, and then texted the Tenant
at 8:15 pm on December 20, 2018 that the N11 was in her mailbox. The Landlord testified that it was her
belief, based on her December 19, 2018 telephone conversation




 
with the Tenant, that the Tenant wanted to move, and that was the reason she provided the N11.
 
51.  On the basis of the evidence provided, and
on a balance of probabilities, I am satisfied that the Landlord believed that
the Tenant was receptive to a face-to-face meeting as soon as possible. I am also satisfied that the Tenant was
not aware of the Landlord’s specific meeting date and time; however, when the Landlord
did arrive at the rental
unit, the Tenant willingly engaged in discussion with the Landlord at
the front door. I am satisfied that
the Landlord never did enter the rental unit on December 20, 2018 – respecting
the Tenant’s wishes to leave the N11
in the mailbox. I therefore find that the Tenants have not established that the Landlords breached the Tenants’
privacy through an illegal
entry of the rental unit in contravention of s. 25 of the Act.
 
Substantial Interference
 
52.  The Tenant testified
that the Landlords
substantially interfered with her reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit
by:
 
a)    
Requesting extra rent to pay for additional occupants;
b)    
Requesting extra money for pest control
fees;
c)     
Requesting a market adjusted
rent increase;
d)    
Requesting reductions in unit heat;
and
e)    
Requesting information about the number
of occupants in the unit.
 
53.  Section 22 of the Act states:
 
A landlord shall not at any time during a tenant’s occupancy of a
rental unit and before the day on which an order evicting the tenant is
executed substantially interfere with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental
unit or the residential complex in which it is located for all
usual purposes by a tenant or members of his or her household.
 
Requesting Extra Rent
 
54.  The Tenant testified
that from the start of the tenancy
on April 1, 2018 through
to the end of 2018, the Landlord continually badgered her for extra rent
based on the number of occupants in the rental unit. The Tenant submitted several text messages from the Landlord
requesting additional rent for additional occupants. The Tenant stated that she paid
this extra rent until the end of 2018, but refused to pay starting in 2019.
 
55.  The Landlords’ representative submitted
that the Landlords acknowledge these requests for extra rent, and as agreed
during the T1 application portion of this hearing, have agreed to refund the additional rent to the Tenants. The Landlords testified
that it was not
their intent to badger the Tenant.
 
56. 
I accept
that on numerous occasions the Landlords asked the Tenants
for additional rent contrary to s. 134(1)(a)
of the Act. I also accept that the Tenants
paid this additional rent for the first nine months of their
tenancy – perpetuating the requests from
the Landlords. I am satisfied that the extra rent requests from the Landlords
were annoying, at times




 
aggravating, and did interfere with the Tenants’
reasonable enjoyment of their rental unit.
However, there is no evidence to indicate that these requests significantly
effected the
Tenants’
enjoyment of the rental unit. On the
basis of the evidence provided, I am satisfied
that this interference was not substantial, and therefore, I find that the Landlords did not breach their
responsibilities pursuant to s. 22 of the Act.
 
Requesting Pest Control Fees
 
57.  The Tenant testified that on November 11,
2018, via text message, the Landlord
asked the Tenant for $500.00 in pest control
fees to control
the infestation of ants that allegedly
was a result of the sand deposited in front of the porch by a Sub-Tenant on
August 15, 2018. The Tenant submitted
this text message. The Tenant stated
that the Landlord badgered her for seven days with a couple of text messages
each day to resolve the issue. At the
end of the week, the Tenants relented and agreed to pay for the pest control
fee.
 
58.  The Landlords’ representative submitted
that the Landlords’ discussion with the Tenants regarding payment of the required pest control services
represented a normal negotiation between a landlord and a tenant for the
resolution of damages. He added that
the Landlords were merely seeking the Tenants to hold the Sub-Tenant
financially accountable for the ant issue. The Landlords testified that it was not their intent
to badger the Tenants.
 
59.  I accept that over a seven-day period the
Landlords asked the Tenants, on multiple occasions, to pay for pest control
fees. I also accept that, as a result of negotiations with the Landlords, the Tenants paid these
fees. I am satisfied that these
requests from the Landlords were demanding, and over a short seven-day period,
did interfere with the
Tenants’
reasonable enjoyment of their rental unit. However,
there is no evidence to indicate that these requests significantly degraded the
Tenants’ enjoyment of the rental unit. On the basis of the evidence
provided, I am satisfied that this interference was not substantial,
and therefore, I find that the Landlords did not breach their responsibilities
pursuant to s. 22 of the Act.
 
Requesting A Market Adjusted
Rent Increase
 
60.  The Tenant testified that for a period of
one week, starting December 4, 2018, every two days the Landlord asked the
Tenant for a rent increase adjusted to market conditions. The Tenant stated
that she agreed to increase the rent, via a text message to the Landlord on
December 12, 2018, only if they had additional occupants in the rental unit.
The Tenant stated that the Landlord did not accept
this offer, and the rent did not change.
 
61.  The Landlords’ representative submitted that there
was no change to the legal rent of
$1600.00 from November 2018 to the end of the tenancy
on July 31, 2019.
 
62.  I accept that over a one-week period the
Landlords asked the Tenants, every couple of days, for a market adjusted rent
increase; however, this increase was never implemented. I am satisfied that these requests from the Landlords were
aggravating, and over the period of one week, did interfere
with the Tenants’
reasonable enjoyment of their rental unit. However, there is no evidence to indicate
that these requests




 
significantly
degraded the Tenants’ enjoyment of the rental unit. On the basis of the evidence provided, I am satisfied
that this interference was not substantial, and therefore,
I find that the Landlords did not breach their responsibilities pursuant to s.
22 of the Act.
 
Requesting Reductions In Unit Heat
 
63.  The Tenant testified that on December 9,
2018, the Landlord advised her that unit heat would be reduced to 20 degrees
Celsius. The Tenant submitted a text message
from the Landlord on this
issue. The Tenant contended that the
Landlord made this statement as a result of the Tenant’s text message on
December 4, 2018 reminding the Landlord that 90 day written notices to tenants
are required for any rent increases.
 
64.  The Landlord testified that she is unable
to control the temperature in the rental unit. She noted that 23 degrees
Celsius is the standard temperature in the winter in the residential complex
– two degrees higher than the municipal
standard. The Landlord
stated further that the intent of
her text message to the Tenant on December 9, 2018
was to point out that two degrees more heat was being provided than required,
and the message was not intended to threaten a reduction of heat below municipal standards that would reduce the Tenants’ reasonable enjoyment of the
rental unit.
 
65.  I am satisfied that the Landlord’s text
message to the Tenant on December 9, 2018 was not a declaration by the Landlord
that the unit heat would be reduced to 20 degrees Celsius. I accept that no evidence
was provided that the unit heat was reduced below the
municipal standard of 21 degrees Celsius at anytime during the tenancy. I am satisfied that neither the December
9, 2018 text message, nor the level of heat in the rental unit, degraded the
Tenants’ enjoyment of their rental unit. On
the basis of the evidence provided, I am satisfied
that this interference was not substantial,
and therefore, I find that the Landlords did not breach their
responsibilities pursuant to s. 22 of the Act.
 
Requesting Information About Occupants
 
66.  The Tenant testified
that during the course of the tenancy
the Landlord asked on multiple occasions about the number,
names, and phone numbers of the occupants in the rental unit. The Tenant submitted numerous text
messages with these requests. The
Tenant stated that she provided this information to the Landlord from April 1,
2018 until December 20, 2018 – the day the Landlord provided her with an N11. The Tenant testified that providing this
information to the Landlord substantially interfered with her reasonable
enjoyment of the rental unit.
 
67.  The Landlord testified
that she tried to keep track of the occupants
living in the rental unit to satisfy the requirements of her
home insurance; however, this task was difficult because she believed that the
Tenant was misrepresenting who was an occupant in the unit. The Landlord’s representative submitted
that the Tenants provided this information freely for nine months, until
December 20, 2018, after which providing this information became an issue for the
Tenants.
 
68.  I accept that the Landlord
sought unit occupant
information from the Tenant for insurance
purposes, and the Tenant provided this information to the Landlord for nine
months. While I accept that these Landlord requests may have been annoying, the
Tenant




 
willingly
complied with these requests for nine months, before not furnishing the
information. I am not satisfied that
these requests significantly degraded the Tenants’ reasonable enjoyment of
their rental unit. On the basis of the
evidence provided, I am satisfied that this interference was not substantial, and therefore, I find that the Landlords did not breach their
responsibilities pursuant to s. 22 of the Act.
 
Landlord’s Ongoing
Conduct
 
69.  In addition to considering whether
the five individual incidents raised by the
Tenants, as listed in paragraph 52 above, constitute substantial interference, I have also considered
whether they, in totality, constitute substantial interference as a result of
the Landlord’s ongoing conduct.
 
70.  I am satisfied that the Landlord’s conduct
during the five incidents was over-bearing, resulting in numerous requests to
the Tenant. Over the nine-month
period in question from April 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018, I accept that two
of the five request incidents occurred over a short duration
of one week, and one incident occurred on a single day. I
also accept that the requests from the Landlord were usually in the form of a
text message to the Tenant, and that the Tenant freely and actively responded
to the Landlord via text message, and on many occasions also submitted requests
to the Landlord via text message. I
find that the text message dialogue between the Landlord and the Tenant was
reciprocal, and employed to resolve tenancy issues to the benefit of both
parties. On the basis of the evidence
provided, I am satisfied that the Landlord’s interference of the Tenants
through numerous requests, in their totality, was not substantial. I therefore find that the Landlords did
not breach their responsibilities pursuant to s. 22 of the Act.
 
Harassment – Receipt
of an N11
 
71.  Section 23 of the Act states: “A landlord
shall not harass, obstruct, coerce, threaten or interfere with a tenant”. While there is no definition of
“harassment” in the Act, it is generally held that “harassment” is a course
of conduct that a reasonable person knows or ought
to know would be unwelcome.
 
72.  The Tenant testified that she felt harassed
by the Landlord when the Landlord provided her with an N11 Agreement to End the
Tenancy (N11) on December 20, 2018 at the rental unit. The Tenant testified further that the Landlord did not
physically harm her or threaten to harm her, but that the harassment was
verbal. The Tenant did not offer any specific dialogue from the Landlord
that was deemed as harassment. The
Tenant claimed that the Landlord was trying to evict her through the use of an
N11, and she felt harassed by
this action. The Tenant did not
provide witness, photographic or video evidence of the Landlord’s alleged
harassment conduct.
 
73.  The Landlord testified that her short
meeting with the Tenant at the front
door of the rental
unit on December 20, 2018 was peaceful. The
Landlord stated that when the Tenant advised
her that she did not want to talk about the N11, and requested that it be left
in the mailbox, she deposited the
N11 in the mailbox and departed the property.
The Landlord testified that it was her belief, based on her December 19,
2018 telephone conversation with the Tenant, that the Tenant wanted to move,
and that was the reason she provided




 
the N11. The Landlord stated that it was not her
intent to harass or threaten the Tenant to sign the N11. She did not believe that her behaviour would be considered unwelcome by the Tenant, nor did the Tenant at the time advise
her that her conduct was unwelcome.
 
74.  I accept that the Landlord and the Tenant
had a short discussion at the front door of the rental unit regarding the
tenancy and an N11. I also accept
that when the Tenant did not want to discuss the particulars of the N11, and
requested that the Landlord leave it in the mailbox – that is what the Landlord
did. Without specific evidence from
the Tenant demonstrating otherwise, on a balance of probabilities, I am
satisfied that the Landlord’s conduct at the rental unit on December 20, 2018
was not threatening, and would not be considered unwelcome by a reasonable
person. I am also satisfied that the
action of the Landlord arriving with, and then depositing the N11 in the Tenant’s
mailbox, as instructed, is not an act of harassment. The N11 is an agreement that the Tenant
can freely choose to sign or not – it is not a notice of eviction.
 
75.  On the basis of the evidence
provided by both parties, I am satisfied
that the Landlord
did not harass the Tenant during her visit to the rental unit on
December 20, 2018 to discuss the N11. Given
the circumstances, a reasonable person would not find the Landlord’s actions to
be unwelcome. I therefore find that
the Landlords did not breach their obligations pursuant to s. 23 of the Act.
 
Summary – T2 Application
 
76.  As the Tenants
have not established that the Landlords
illegally entered their
rental unit, substantially
interfered with their reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit, and harassed
them, the Tenants’ application must be dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
With respect
to the Tenants’ T1 application, the Landlords shall pay to the Tenants
the sum of $1038.54. This
amount represents $885.00 collected for illegal rent, $100.00 collected for an
illegal rent deposit, and $43.54 for rent deposit interest.
 
2.    
If the Landlords do not
pay the Tenants the full amount owing by January 16, 2022, the Landlords will owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 17, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
 
3.    
The Tenants’
T3 application is dismissed.
 
4.    
The Tenants’
T2 application is dismissed.
