Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-06460-18










 

KI (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict LH (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on July 31,
2018.
 
The Landlord’s property manager,
SG and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
The Landlord’s application was
amended to indicate the correct monthly rent.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from May 1, 2018 to
July 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective May 24, 2018.
2.     
The monthly rent as of the
date of the hearing is $1,261.74.
3.     
The Tenant has made no
payments after the application was filed.
4.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,261.74 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2018 to May 24, 2018.
6.     
There was no dispute that
the Tenant owes the Landlord the amount of $3,960.22, which represents the
arrears to July 31, 2018, and the application filing fee.
7.     
The Tenant says that she has
not paid the rent because she only worked fifteen days in May and received
approximately $900.00. She also receives a monthly child tax benefit of
$550.00. She has not worked in June and July. In May 2018, she received $600.00
from her mother who lives in California to purchase groceries. She expects to
return to employment in August 2018 and says she will have a monthly income of
$2,400.00. 
8.     
The Tenant proposed to pay
the rent when due and an additional $300.00 towards the arrears until the
arrears are paid in full. It would take the Tenant over a year to pay the
arrears. 
9.     
The Landlord requested a
standard order and submitted that in the past the Tenant promised to pay and
did not do so. Furthermore the Landlord submitted that the Tenant has many
cheques returned for non- sufficient funds. This was not disputed by the
Tenant. The Landlord says that the parties were recently at the Board in March
on an L1 application and the Tenant voided the order. 
10.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.  I considered the
Tenant’s payment plan and find the length to be unreasonable. The Landlord
should not have to wait for over a year for the arrears to be paid. I also
considered that the Tenant had funds available and did not pay even a token
amount toward the arrears. The Tenant was recently before the Board on arrears
in March 2018, and it seems to me that the Tenant is having financial
difficulties sustaining this tenancy.
11.  
The Tenant requested until
December 2018 to move out of the unit. I considered that the Tenant has lived
in the unit since 2013. However, the Tenant is substantial arrears and now owes
the Landlord over $5,000.00. The Tenant is in arrears of rent since May (over
three months), and any delay in eviction will prejudice the Landlord as arrears
will continue to accrue. As such, there will be no delay in terminating the
tenancy.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before August
14, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $2,669.94*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to August 3, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $41.48 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
August 4, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before August 14, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
August 15, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before August 14, 2018, then starting August 15, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after August 15, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before August 14,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $5,221.96** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after August 15, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
