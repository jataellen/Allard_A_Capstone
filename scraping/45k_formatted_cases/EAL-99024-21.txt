Rita Weinbrand (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Amanda Fraser (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified in the order
issued by the Board on September 10, 2021 with respect to application
HOL-10973-21.

The Landlord
has applied under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act to terminate the tenancy earlier than
stipulated in order HOL-10973-21.
 
2.    
In this application this type of application is not permissible as the parties did not agree to
the inclusion of section 78 in the order and the order makes no mention of
section 78.
 
3.    
This application is dismissed, however
the existing order HOL-10973-21 still remains in full force and effect.
 
It is ordered that:
