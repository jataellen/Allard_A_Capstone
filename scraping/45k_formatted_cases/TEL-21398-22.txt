MAIN FL UPSTAIRS, 1267 WARDEN AVENUE SCARBOROUGH ON M1R2R4


 




Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Cassandra Symons
  Joanne Gibbons


 
Tenants



 
 
On February 1, 2022, Muhammad
Arif (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Joanne Gibbons and Cassandra Symons (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on December 15, 2021
with respect to application TEL-16269- 21-RV.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenants
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the
Tenants did not meet certain conditions specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants
have not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The
Tenants failed to pay January 2022’s lawful monthly rent in full, on or before
January 3, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $12,000.00 for rent arrears
in Order TEL-16269-21-RV. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $3,540.00 and that amount is included in this order.
As a result, the previous order TEL-16269-21-RV is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.
 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,700.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.




File Number: TEL-21398-22
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from July 1, 2016 to
February 11, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order TEL-16269-21-RV is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants
must move out of the rental unit on or before February 22, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $3,587.32*. This amount represents the rent owing up to February 11, 2022, less the
rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $65.75
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 12,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
22, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 23, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 22, 2022, then starting
February 23, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 23, 2022.
