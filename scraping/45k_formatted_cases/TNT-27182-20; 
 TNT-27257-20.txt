Azadeh
Azarnia, Alireza Ghorbanzadeh (the 'Tenants') applied for an order determining
that Khushnaz & Suhail Karim (the 'Landlords') or the Landlords'
superintendent/agent harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered
with them, entered the rental unit illegally and altered the locking system on
a door giving entry to the rental unit or residential complex without giving
them replacement keys, and an order determining that Landlords have collected
or retained money illegally.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 12, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s Representative D. Carr and the Tenants attended
the hearing.
 
Matters # TNT-27182-20 and # TNT-27257-20 relate to the same property
and parties and on consent they were heard together.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    The Tenants brought a T2 Application pursuant to
s.29(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the “Act”), which alleges the Landlords or the Landlords' superintendent/agent harassed, obstructed,
coerced, threatened or interfered with them, entered the rental unit illegally
and altered the locking system on a door giving entry to the rental unit or
residential complex without giving them replacement keys.
 
2.    In addition to the T2 Application, the Tenants brought
a T1 Application, which alleges the Landlords
charged the Tenants
an illegal rent. This application was brought pursuant
to




 
Section 135(1) of the Act which
provides a tenant may apply to the Board for an order that the landlord pay to
the tenant any money collected or retained in contravention of the Act.
 
3.    The Tenants signed a one-year lease (the “Lease”),
with the term commencing on September 15, 2019 and ending on September 14,
2020. The monthly rent was $2,700.
 
4.    The Tenants paid one year’s worth of rent in two lump
sums at the commencement of the tenancy. In
addition, the Tenants paid to the Landlords $200 for a key deposit.
 
T1 Application
 
Illegal Rent
 
5.    The Tenant Alireza Ghorbanzadeh (“AG”) testified that
the Tenants discussed with the Landlords the possibility of ending the tenancy
early and in this regard, were provided with a Form N9 to fill out.
 
6.    AG testified that the Landlords agreed they could
move out two months early and that they would be reimbursed a total
of $4,600.00, being two months rent $5,400.00 plus the key deposit of $200.00,
but less an agreed upon amount of $1,000.00 for leakage caused in the unit.
 
7.    The Tenants produced a form N9, containing a notice of
termination date of July 5, 2020. While the Form N9 is dated May 5, 2020, AG
acknowledged that “May 5” was a mistake and that the document was emailed to
the Landlord’s agent at the end of June 2020. Regardless, AG testified that the
Landlords agreed the Tenants would “get back” the balance of rent.
 
8.   
The Tenants’ T1 Application
alleges “based on verbal agreement, email, and text messages we partially
moved out on 03/JUL/2020”. At the hearing, no text or email messages were
produced from any point in time prior to vacating the unit to substantiate the
terms of the verbal agreement, or its existence.   AG’s testimony lacked particulars of the alleged verbal agreement, including the date it was
supposedly made or the motivation for the Landlords in accepting such an
arrangement.
 
9.    While there may have been some discussion with the
Landlords about vacating the rental unit early, I do not find on a balance of
probabilities that there was any such agreement or meeting of the minds. This portion of the Tenant’s application
is denied.
 
Key Deposit
 
10. Section 105 of the Act provides that the only security
deposit that a landlord may collect is a rent deposit. A key deposit was paid to the Landlord at the commencement of
the tenancy in the amount of $200.00. I find that this deposit was not returned
to the Tenants and was collected contrary to section 105 of the Act.




 
 
 
 
T2 Application
 
Illegal entry / Changing
of the locks / Interference
 
11. AG says the Tenants moved out on July 3, 2020 and a
meeting with the Landlord was planned for July 5, 2020 so that keys could be
exchange and the balance of the Tenants’ items could be retrieved. AG tendered a text message exchange with
the Landlord’s agent, Sandy Bhutani,
from Friday July 3, 2020 which confirms the original meeting date of July
5, 2020: “Just wanna make sure we are set for Sunday?”
 
12. AG testified that the July 5 meeting was postponed at
the request of the Landlords to July 10, but ultimately the Landlords did not
show up. AG further testified that he
returned to the residential complex on July 12 and was denied entry. A video was tendered as evidence whereby
the Landlords’ superintendent advised the Tenants that they are not allowed in
the unit, and that there were only “2 empty luggage bags” in the unit at
the time the locks were changed.
 
13. At the hearing, AG testified there was approximately
$500 worth of the Tenants’ insulin medication left behind in the fridge and
luggage. AG further added that he
pleaded with the Landlord to access the Tenant’s belonging, without success.
 
14. While it is reasonable for a Landlord to enter a unit
and change locks once a tenant has vacated or abandoned a unit, in this case
the Tenants still had items at the rental unit, had paid rent for this period
of time and had been in communications with the Landlords’ agent about
returning to the rental unit.
 
15. I find the Landlords interfered with the Tenants and
acted unreasonably by denying them access to their belongings. The Landlord’s superintendent references
only “2 empty luggage bags” as being left behind in the video evidence
from July 12, 2020. I find AG’s
evidence, which was subject to cross-examination, more believable that there
were belongings left behind for a total value of $500.00. The Tenants should be compensated for this
loss.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlords shall pay to the Tenants the sum of $700.00. This amount represents
$500.00 for the value of items left behind and $200.00 for the key deposit.
 
2.    
The Landlords shall also pay to the Tenants
$101.00 for the cost of filing the applications.
 
3.    
The total amount the Landlords owe to the Tenants is $801.00.
 
4.    
If the Landlords do not pay the Tenants
the full amount
owing by February 11, 2022, the Landlords will owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 11, 2022at 2.00% annually on the
outstanding balance.




 
5.    
The Tenants have the right, at any time, to collect
the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
