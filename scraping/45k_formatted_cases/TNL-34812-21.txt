Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-34812-21



In the matter
of:


196
  CEDAR STREET KESWICK ON L4P2J5


 




Between:


Jinfei Huang


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Owen Davis


 
Tenant



 
 
Jinfei Huang (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Owen Davis
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 10, 2022.
 
Only the
Landlord's Legal Representative, Yun Tao Li, attended the hearing. As of 3:31
p.m. the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although properly
served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the total
rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from April 11, 2020 to January 10, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective September
18, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
3.    
The lawful monthly rent is $1,650.00.
4.    
The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed.
5.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,600.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenant for the period from December 12, 2017
to September 18, 2021.
 
7.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in
accordance with section 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord
attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 20, 2022.
 
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $10,001.85*, which represents the amount
of rent owing and
compensation up to February 9, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$54.25 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 10, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
20, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 21, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 20, 2022, then starting February
21, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 21, 2022.
 
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)              
$13,536.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 10, 2022,
or
ii)             
$15,186.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 20, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 21, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
