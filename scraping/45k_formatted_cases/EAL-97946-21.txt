Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number: EAL-97946-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
410, 1800 BASELINE ROAD OTTAWA ON K2C3N1


 




Between:


Minto Multi-res Income Prtnrs 1, GP


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Lin Yuan


Tenant



 
 
 
Minto Multi-res Income Prtnrs 1, GP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Lin Yuan (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that
the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 18, 2022. Only the Landlord’s representative, Anne Skelly,
attended the hearing. As of 2:15 p.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
June 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective July 28,
2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,784.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,784.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021 to July 28, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $5,094.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the
parties and whether the Landlord
attempted to negotiate
a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.

2.

per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 29, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the

$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.

vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 9, 2022.

i)               
$4,325.25 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$6,109.25 if the payment
is made on or before
February 8, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 9, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
