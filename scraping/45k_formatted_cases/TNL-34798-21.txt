Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-34798-21



In the matter
of:


20 GOODWILL AVENUE NORTH YORK ON M3H1V6


 




Between:


Veronica Douse


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Marciano Csaba Fenyvesi


 
Tenant



 
 
Veronica Douse (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Marciano Csaba Fenyvesi (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
video conference on January
10, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Stanley Fienberg, attended the hearing.
As of 3:21 p.m. the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the
Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
11, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
3.    
The lawful monthly rent is $4,500.00.
4.    
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
5.    
The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed.
6.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with section 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord
attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 20, 2022.




File Number: TNL-34798-21
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $28,467.85*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 9, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $147.95
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 10,
2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
20, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 21, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 20, 2022, then starting
February 21, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 21, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 20, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $31,686.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction
will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and
the Tenant could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 21, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
