Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-24136-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


504, 375 KING
STREET W TORONTO ON M5V1K1


 




Between:


Subodh Verma


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 


Tenant




 


Devaughn
Stephenson


 



 
 
 
Subodh Verma (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Devaughn Stephenson (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021. The Landlord's Legal Representative, Dan
Schofield and the Tenant attended the hearing. The Tenant spoke with Duty
Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Preliminary Issue:
 
The Tenant stated
that he received the Notice
to End your Tenancy Early for Non-payment of Rent (N4) by
email. The Landlord responded that it was sent by mail on August 16, 2021 and was also attached to
an email sent to the Tenant.
 
I am satisfied by the Landlord’s evidence and
Certificate of Service that the N4 was sent to the Tenant by mail. As the notice
was sent on August 16, 2021, the Tenant is deemed to have received it on August 21, 2021 pursuant
to section 191 (3) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 which states that a notice or document
given by mail shall be deemed to have been given on the fifth day
after mailing.
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from July 15, 2021 to January 14, 2022.
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 6, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,900.00.




File Number: TSL-24136-21
 
4.     
The Tenant
paid $3,000.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.     
The Tenant, who moved
into the rental unit in April 2021, testified that he is self employed and made
approximately $12,000.00 in November
2021. The Tenant has a young daughter
and her mother fell ill from the Covid-19 virus.
The Tenant proposed
a plan to pay $500.00 towards
the arrears each month in addition to ongoing rent. Given
the length of the tenancy and the Tenant’s failure to pay any rent since
October 2021 despite his income, I am not satisfied that the Tenant will comply
with a conditional order.
 
6.     
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,900.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 15, 2021 to September 6, 2021.
 
8.     
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the
Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant and find
that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 4, 2022
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. Additional time given to the Tenant
to either secure
alternative accommodation or pay the outstanding amount.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before February 4, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $6,369.80*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 11, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay
to the Landlord $62.47 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 12, 2022 to the date the
Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 4, 2021, the
Tenant will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from February 5, 2021 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 4, 2022, then starting February
5, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
February 5, 2022.




File Number: TSL-24136-21
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$8,586.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 14, 2022,
or
ii)             
$10,486.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 4, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after
February 5, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
