Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12844-22
 
 



In the
  matter of:


UPPER, 98 CRUMLIN CRESCENT BRAMPTON ON L6X0Y4


 




Between:


Manvinder Kaur Maini Paramjit Singh Maini Prabhjot
  Singh Maini


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Courtney Antonio Jaddoo Tenia Jasmine Walters


Tenants



 
 
 
Manvinder Kaur Maini, Paramjit
Singh Maini and Prabhjot Singh Maini
(the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tenia
Jasmine Walters and Courtney Antonio Jaddoo
(the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued
by the Board on December 16, 2021
with respect to application HOL-11765-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlords could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenants have not
met the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenants failed
to pay $450.00 towards the arrears on or before
November 20, 2021. The
Tenants failed to pay the lawful monthly rent in full on or before December 1,
2021.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the
Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlords are entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $5,400.00 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
HOL-11765-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $2,250.00
and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous
order HOL-11765-21 is cancelled.




 
5.    
The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $2,700.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from April
25, 2021 to January 18, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order HOL-11765-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 29, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
pay to the Landlord $1,147.86*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 18, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$88.77 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 19, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
January 29, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
January 30, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 29, 2022, then starting January
30, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after January 30, 2022.

The tenant has until January 28, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 28, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on July 30, 2022 if
the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
