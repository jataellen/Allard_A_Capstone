Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
 
File Number: CEL-67109-17
 










 



 


 


 




 


 
 


 



 

C
P, V P and  OntInc (‘CP, ‘VP’ and ‘OntInc’, or collectively, the 'Landlords')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict C E (‘CE’ or the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.  (L1
Application)
 
This
application was heard in Mississauga on June 21, 2017 and July 21, 2017.
 
Two of the Landlords, CP and VP, and the Tenant attended the
hearing the hearing on June 21, 2017.    Only two of the Landlords, CP and VP, attended
the hearing on July 21, 2017.
 
Preliminary Issues
 
At the June 21, 2017 hearing, the Tenant raised the following
issues pursuant to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act'): illegal entry, substantial interference with reasonable enjoyment
and harassment.  Initially, the Tenant requested an adjournment so she could
better prepare her case, but I denied that request.  There were still 45
minutes left in the hearing block, and I directed the Tenant to itemize the
issues to be raised so that at the very least, the Landlords would be aware of
the issues they would need to defend against. 
 
Determinations:
 
June 21, 2017 Hearing
 
1.      The
Landlords submitted an L1 update sheet in order to update the payments and
arrears accounted for since the filing of the application on May 26, 2017.
2.      At
this hearing, there was not enough time in the hearing block to hear the
entirety of the section 82 issues raised by the Tenant.
3.      The
Tenant submitted 3 exhibits (TT#1 to TT#3) to itemize and support of part of
her claims, but she did not have the opportunity to complete her evidence.
4.      The
Landlords submitted 6 exhibits (LL#1 to LL#6) in response to the partial
claims.
5.      Having
clearly heard only a part of the Tenant’s intended case, and only being
effectively able to itemize the substantial issues to be heard, I made no
findings on June 21, 2017.  
6.      I
determined that another hearing would need to be scheduled to hear the balance
of the Tenant’s section 82 claims and the Landlords’ response to those claims,
and I informed the parties that I would be seized of the matter.
7.      There
are a sufficient amount of arrears under the L1 application and I issued
interim order CEL-67109-17-IN, calling for the disclosure of issues and
evidence between the parties, and ordering the Tenant to pay rents into the
Board on or before certain dates.
8.      Interim
orders, such as order CEL-67109-17-IN, are commonplace and fairly standard.
They are designed to ensure that the delay caused by the adjournment does not
cause additional prejudice to the landlord with respect to additional arrears
accruing, and to help prevent possible abuses of process.  For example, it is
an abuse of process for a tenant to raise section 82 issues for the sole purpose
of delaying the proceedings.  If a tenant complies with an order for payment
into the Board, they have the benefit of demonstrating that the tenant is
serious about their section 82 claims and not simply raising them to buy more
time before eviction.
July
21, 2017 Hearing
9.      I
confirmed with the Board that the Tenant made no payments into the Board as
called for under interim order CEL-67109-17-IN.
10.   The
Landlords submitted an L1 update sheet, and confirmed the Tenant made no rent
payments to the Landlords since the filing of the L1 application.
11.   As
well, the Landlords testified that the Tenant provided no documentation, issues
or evidence of any kind to them as called for under interim order
CEL-67109-17-IN.   Because of that, the Landlords confirmed they provided no
disclosure in return, and pointed out that on June 21, 2017, they have already
submitted a part of the evidence they intend to rely upon.
12.   Given
the non-compliance of the Tenant in respect of interim order CEL-67109-17-IN,
and given the fact that the Tenant is not present at this hearing, I indicated
that I was exercising my jurisdiction under subsection 195(4) of the Act and
would not consider the Tenant’s evidence and submissions with respect to any
section 82 claims, but would consider the Tenant’s circumstances under section
83 of the Act.
 
 
L1
Application
13.   The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from January 7, 2017 to August 6, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective April 18, 2017.
14.   The
Landlords affirmed that they are losing money daily and they simply want the
unit back if the rent owing is not paid.   Because of the delay in these
proceedings to date, and because the Tenant failed to comply with the interim order
and has not attended today’s hearing, the Landlords are requesting a seven-day
voidable order for eviction.
15.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.    Under the circumstances, a seven-day voidable
eviction order is warranted. 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before August 1, 2017.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $5,293.02*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to July 25, 2017 (which is the date of this
order).
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $26.30 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting July 26, 2017 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before
August 5, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from August 6, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before August 1, 2017, then starting August 2,
2017, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after August 2,
2017.
8.      If,
on or before August 1, 2017, the Tenant pays the amount of $5,790.00** to the
Landlords or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after August 2, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlords. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
