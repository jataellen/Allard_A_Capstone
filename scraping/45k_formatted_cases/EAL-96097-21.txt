Tenants



 
 
 
Nuala Lawler & Michael
Pawsey (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Adiza Mohammed and Farouk
Timbilla (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 11, 2021. Only the Landlord’s representative, Anne Skelly, attended
the hearing. As of 10:42am,
the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from March 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective June 10, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
vacated the rental
unit on November
13, 2021. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,664.60.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,600.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from September
25, 2018 to June 10, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenants paid $2,764.00 after
the application was filed.




File Number: EAL-96097-21

for the cost of filing the application.
