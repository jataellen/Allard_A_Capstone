Order under Section 100
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-19456-20
 
 



In the
  matter of:


1113, 155 BALLIOL STREET TORONTO ON M4S1C4


 




Between:


Amelin Property Management


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Ataollah Naseri


Tenant



 
 
Amelin Property Management (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy of Ataollah Naseri
(the 'Tenant'), because
the Tenant transferred occupancy without the Landlord’s
consent.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on February
15, 2022. The Landlord’s
representative Micheal Holzberg, and the Tenant, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
The Tenant’s
monthly rent is $942.54. The Landlord claims
the Tenant has a woman living in the
rental unit who is paying him $1,300.00 per month to occupy the unit. The Landlord submits that there have
maintenance requests for the unit from people other than the Tenant.
 
The Tenant testified that he has a roommate
who pays him $500.00 per month. He also testified that he informed the Landlord
on December 8, 2020 that he would have someone move in with him. The Tenants rent continues to be paid
directly to the Landlord.
 
The Landlord
travels between Toronto
and British Columbia
for work. This is a 14-year tenancy.
 
I am not satisfied
that the Tenant is no longer residing
in the rental unit and has transferred the tenancy without the Landlord’s consent.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord's application is dismissed.
