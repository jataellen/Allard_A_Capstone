Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-25443-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


243 WILSON STREET HAMILTON ON L8L1R9


 




Between:


Harpreet Bilkhu


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Ann Cadorette
  Micheal Snook


Tenants



 
 
 
Harpreet Bilkhu (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ann Cadorette and Micheal
Snook (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on February 1, 2022. The Landlord’s Legal
Representative, Adam Hamdani
and one of the Tenants,
Ann Cadorette, attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from June 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective September 5, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,850.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,850.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from April
1, 2021 to September 5, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenants paid $3,699.00 after
the application was filed.




 
Tenant Submissions S83
 
7.     The Tenant entered
into a lease agreement with her
common law partner Michael Snook (MS) and the Tenant submitted that
they agreed that AC will pay to thirds of the rent for her and her son, and MS
will pay one third for his portion of the rent.
 
8.     After 2 weeks of tenancy the Tenant
MS left the residence with no notice,
but submitted a letter to the Landlord that he would
honour his share of the lease agreement with Ann Cadorette (AC).
 
9.    
After missing the
first rent period the Tenant
AC tried to contact and find MS but
was unable to determine his whereabouts or contact MS through his family.
 
10.  AC is on a fixed
income and has been paying
her portion and her son’s portion of the rent
(two thirds) as agreed to with MS.
 
11. 
AC suffers
from various medical
ailments brought on by stress
and is on ODSP and can
only pay two thirds of the rent.
 
12.  AC submitted that she would need until March 31, 2022
in order to find housing appropriate to her income, but offered to continue to pay two thirds of the rent to the Landlord in good faith as she had been
doing since MS left the unit.
 
 
 
Findings and Analysis
 
13.  AC has continued to pay two thirds of the rent since
MS left the unit and has not been heard from
since, however AC is unable to afford the full rent for the unit and maintain the tenancy.
 
14.  I find the Tenant credible and accept her testimony
that she in good faith, was trying not to fall into arrears but due to the circumstances of MS leaving and not paying the portion of the rent that was agreed upon by AC and MS, the Tenant
AC is unable to maintain
the tenancy.
 
15.  I find the offer from AC to
pay two thirds of the rent for February 2022 and March 2022 to be in good faith to the
Landlord to allow an extended eviction to March 31, 2022.
 
16.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and therefore, I find that it
would not be unfair to postpone
the eviction until March 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b)
of the Act.




 
 
 
 
It is ordered
that:

$60.82 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 9, 2022
