Gina Osmond


Tenant



 
 
 
1535
Birchmount Investments Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Gina Osmond (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the
Tenant pay the rent she owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on June 30, 2021 with respect to
application TEL-13820-20.
 
The Landlord's
application was resolved by order TEL-20629-21, issued on November 26, 2021.
The Tenant filed a motion to set aside order TEL-20629-21.
 
This motion
was heard by video conference on January 28, 2022. The Landlord's Legal
Representative, N. Mizzi and the Tenant attended the hearing. The Tenant spoke
with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
Order TEL-13820-20 provided that the Landlord
could apply to the Board under section
78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and
evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain
conditions specified in the order.
 
2.    
The Landlord filed the application under
section 78 of the Act, alleging that the Tenant
failed to pay $450.00
in arrears respectively on July 4, 2021, August
4, 2021, September 4, 2021, and October
4, 2021, contrary to the order. This resulted in ex parte eviction order TEL-
20629-21 terminating the tenancy.
 
3.    
In support
of the motion to set aside the order, the Tenant testified that having paid the rent and $350.00 in arrears on the first
day of the month, she erroneously thought she was required to pay an additional
$350.00 on the 4th.
 
4.    
The Tenant requested an
opportunity to continue the tenancy
by making the payments as previously ordered. The Tenant is in
receipt of income from the Ontario
Disability Support Program and has resided in the unit for about 15 years.




 
5.    
The Landlord opposed the Tenant’s
motion, but the parties agreed that the outstanding arrears is $5,187.14.
 
6.    
Although the
Tenant breached the order, section 78(11)(b) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 provides that the Board shall set aside the eviction order if the Board is satisfied,
having regard to all the circumstances, that it would not be unfair to do so.
The evidence demonstrates that the Tenant who is on limited income from the Ontario Disability Support Program, has, in good faith, made several payments each
month in an attempt to comply with order TEL-13820-20. In these circumstances,
including the long term of the tenancy, it would not be unfair to set aside
order TEL-20629-21, which terminated
the tenancy.
 
7.    
Based on the Notice
of Rent Increase dated September 16, 2021, the monthly rent is
$1,080.32 starting January 1, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The motion to set aside Order TEL-20629-21, issued on
November 26, 2021, is granted. The order cannot be enforced by the Landlord.
 
2.     The order issued by the Board on June 30, 2021 with
respect to application TEL-13820- 20, is cancelled and replaced with this
order.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,187.14, which represents the amount outstanding.
 
4.    
The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant
is denied on the condition
that:
