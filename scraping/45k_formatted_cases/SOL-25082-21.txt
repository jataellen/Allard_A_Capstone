Order under Section
87(1)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-25082-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


404, 73 NORTH PARK
STREET BRANTFORD ON N3R4J8


 




Between:


Meddco Properties Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Heidi Morgenscheweis


Tenant



 
 
 
Meddco Properties Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Heidi Morgenscheweis (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 18, 2022.
Only the Landlord’s Agent,
Jessica Lapkowski, attended the hearing. As of 10:08 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 24, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent for the unit increased
to $889.22.
 
4.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $801.36
from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from December 1, 2013 to September
24, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $3,814.72 after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
