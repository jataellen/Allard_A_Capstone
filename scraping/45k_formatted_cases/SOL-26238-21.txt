Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: SOL-26238-21
 



In the matter
of:


1006, 82 MILLSIDE DRIVE MILTON ON L9T4A1


 




Between:


82 Millside Drive Limited c/o Realstar Management Partnership


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Kathleen Davignon
  Marc Davignon


Tenants



 
82 Millside Drive Limited c/o
Realstar Management Partnership (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kathleen
Davignon and Marc Davignon (the 'Tenants')
because they have been persistently late in paying their rent. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after
the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653#
on February 9, 2022.
Only the Landlord’s Representative, Anthony Kee Fung Ho and Isabelle McNelly
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants were in possession of the rental
unit when the application was filed on November 23, 2021. The Landlord’s
application for eviction is now moot since the Tenants have vacated the rental
unit.
 
2.     The Landlord had reasonable cause to file the
application since the Tenants have persistently failed to pay the rent on the
date it was due at least 12 times in the twelve- month before the N8 Notice was given. As such, the Tenants owe the Landlord
the cost of the application
fee.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall pay the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
