of:


43 BARRINGTON CRESCENT BRAMPTON ON L6Z1N2


 




Between:


Joseph Arulnesan Mariampillai


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


James
Bedell Janice Bedell


Tenants



 
 
 
Joseph Arulnesan
Mariampillai (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Janice Bedell and James Bedell
(the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
The Landlord also applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants because the Landlord has
entered into an agreement of purchase and sale of the rental unit and the purchaser requires
possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential
occupation.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on September 23, 2021. The Landlord attended and was represented by Subajini Niranjan. The Tenant, Janice Bedell, attended
and declined to consult with Duty Counsel prior to the
hearing. The Tenant James Bedell did
not attend as he was sleeping due to night shift.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 Application
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from April
1, 2021 to September 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective June 9, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is
$2,300.00.
 
4.    
The arrears
of rent owing for the period ending September 30, 2021, as of the date of hearing, were $13,800.00.
 
5.    
The Landlord
incurred costs of $201.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.




 
 
 
6.    
There is no rent deposit.
 
7.    
The Tenant
does not dispute
the rent owing, stating that they stopped
paying rent when they received the Notice of Termination for Purchasers Use (form ‘N12) in order to save money for their new rental.
 
8.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
L2 Application
 
1.    
The Landlord
has an agreement with the Purchaser to sell the residential complex
and the purchaser, in good faith, requires possession of the rental unit
for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
2.    
The Landlord has filed
an affidavit sworn by the Purchaser who personally requires the rental unit certifying that the person
in good faith requires the rental unit for his or her own
personal use.
 
3.    
The Landlord
paid the Tenant compensation equal to one month's rent.
 
4.    
The Tenants
have secured alternate
accommodation and will vacate
the rental unit on or before October 1, 2021.
 
5.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before October 1, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $13,800.00* (less any payments made to the Landlord after September 23, 2021), the amount of rent owing to the Landlord from April
1, 2021 to October 1, 2021.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$75.16 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting October 2, 2021 to the
date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the
L1 application.




 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
16, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 17,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before October 1, 2021, then starting October
2, 2021, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after October 2, 2021.
