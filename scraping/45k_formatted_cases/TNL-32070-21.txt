In the
  matter of:


100 ELMWOOD AVENUE TORONTO ON M2N3M2


 




Between:


Yu-Hsin Kuo


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Dong Lee                                         


Tenant




 


and
 
Unauthorized Occupants (name
unknown)


 



 
Yu-Hsin Kuo (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy of Dong Lee (the
'Tenant'), for transferring occupancy of the rental unit to unknown occupants
and for compensation for the use of the rental unit.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 18, 2021.
 
The Landlord was represented by Samuel Eng and Nelson Wan. Jih-Shyan Fan (‘JSF’) appeared as a witness for the Landlord. The Tenant was not present or represented
despite being served with the notice of hearing. The unauthorized occupant also
did not attend.
 
At the onset of the hearing,
the Landlords representative requested to withdraw
the claim for daily
compensation from the unauthorized occupant.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant transferred the occupancy of the rental
unit to unknown persons (hereinafter called the 'Unauthorized
Occupants') in a manner that was not authorized by the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). The Landlord did not enter into a tenancy agreement
with this person or persons.
 
2.     JSF testified that they are the rental
agent for the Landlord. At the hearing
they testified that they
received a text from the Tenant that they were moving out and they further
indicated that the Tenant only paid partial rent for January. On or about February 27, 2021 JSF
discovered that there were still people in the house and that the Tenant had
vacated the rental unit and that they remained in the unit as of the hearing
date without authorization from the Landlord.

3.    
The Landlord filed their A2 application on March 11, 2021. This is within
the 60 days required by subsection 100(2) of the Act. The Unauthorized
Occupants were in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was
filed.
 
4.    
Based on the uncontested evidence
of the Landlord, I find that the Tenant transferred occupancy of the rental
unit on February
27, 2021. This is the date the Landlord became aware that the Tenant transferred
occupancy of the rental unit.
 
5.    
In determining the appropriate eviction date regarding
the unauthorized occupants, I have considered the fact that the tenancy
transferred unlawfully almost
one year ago. I am also
mindful that the Landlord has not received any compensation since that
occurred. Accordingly, I have decided to order eviction the day following the
date of this order.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated as of February
27, 2021.
 
2.     The Unauthorized Occupants
shall move out of the rental unit on or before February
1, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
4.     The Tenant shall pay the Landlord the full amount
owing by February
11, 2022.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing by February 11, 2022, they will owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from February 12, 2022 at 2.00% on the outstanding balance.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated by February 1, 2022, then starting February
2, 2022 the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (the Sheriff), so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord after February 2, 2022.
