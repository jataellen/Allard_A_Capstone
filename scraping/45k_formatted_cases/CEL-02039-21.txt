Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-02039-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


809, 1 ELM DRIVE WEST MISSISSAUGA ON L5B4M1


 




Between:


Xiaowei Zhang


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Gurpratap (aka Gary, Gurupratap) Randhawa


Tenant



 
 
Xiaowei Zhang (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Gurpratap (aka Gary, Gurupratap) Randhawa (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes and because the Landlord requires possession of
the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation by their daughter.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the
unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 4, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord’s Representative R. Yu and the Landlord’s daughter E. Zhang attended the hearing. The Tenant did not attend, although properly served.
 
Determinations:
 
N4/L1 Application
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
May 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.
 
2.    
Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination effective June 4, 2021.
 
3.    
The monthly
rent is $1950.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,950.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period
from January 12, 2019 to June 4, 2021.
 
5.    
Section 83 requires that I consider
all the circumstances, including the Tenant’s
and the Landlord’s situations to determine if it would be appropriate to grant section 83 relief
from eviction. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it




 
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act. There are substantial arrears as no rent
has been paid by the Tenant from May 1, 2021 onwards. The Landlord indicated
there are no children living at the residence.
The Tenant did not attend the hearing, and thus did not provide any
evidence that may be relevant to my determination under s. 83.
 
N12/L2 Application
 
1.   
The Landlord
served the Tenant with an N12 notice
of termination seeking termination of the tenancy for the purpose of
residential occupation by the Landlord’s daughter.
 
2.    The termination date in the notice (the
“N12 notice”) was July 31, 2021. The Landlord has met the 60 day notice requirement of s.48(2) of the Act, and I am satisfied
that the Landlord has met the
declaration requirement of s.72(1)(b) of the Act and the one month’s
compensation requirement of s. 48.1 of the Act.
 
3.    The issue to be determined in this
application is whether the Landlord has satisfied the “good faith” requirement
set out in subsection 48(1). In Salter v. Beljinac, 2001 CanLII 40231 (ON SCDC), the court clarified the Landlord’s good
faith requirement as follows:
 
In my view, [s. 48(1)] charges the finder of fact with the task of
determining whether the landlord’s professed intent to want to reclaim the unit
for a family member is genuine, that is, the notice to terminate the tenancy is
made in good faith. The alternative finding of fact would be that the landlord
does not have a genuine intent to reclaim the unit for the purpose of
residential occupation by a family member.
 
4.   
I am satisfied that, on
a balance of probabilities, the Landlord, in good faith, requires possession of
the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation by the Landlord’s child.
 
5.   
The rental property is
approximately 700 square feet and contains 1 bedroom and 1 den. The Landlord’s
daughter testified that she currently lives in Markham with her parents and
wishes to move into the rental property to obtain a more independent lifestyle. She is a second-year university student
and the location of the rental property is convenient for her studies. I find
her evidence to be credible.
 
6.   
I am satisfied with the
Landlord’s expressed intent and find, on a balance of probabilities, the
Landlord, in good faith, requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation by their daughter.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
N4/L1 Application
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 21, 2022.




 
 
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $14,315.05*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 10, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay
to the Landlord $64.11 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 11, 2022 to the date the
Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 21, 2022, the
Tenant will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 21, 2022, then starting January 22, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 22, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 21, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $17,751.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be
terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
22, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
N12/L2 Application
 
In the event the Tenant voids the order as set out above,
I order as follows:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated, as of
January 21, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 21, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 21, 2022, then starting
January 22, 2022, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
3.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 22, 2022.
