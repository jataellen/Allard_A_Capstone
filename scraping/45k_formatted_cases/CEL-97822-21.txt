File Number: CEL-97822-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


207, 1470 WILLIAMSPORT DRIVE MISSISSAUGA ON L4X1T5


 




Between:


1470 Williamsport Holdings Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Paul Corrigan


Tenant



 
 
 
1470 Williamsport Holdings Inc (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order requiring Paul Corrigan
(the 'Tenant') to pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Howard Levenson,
attended the hearing. As of 12:50 p.m., the Tenant was not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant did not pay the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
November 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant
vacated the rental
unit on November 30, 2020. The Tenant was in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.    
On October 6, 2020, the
Tenant provided to the Landlord a notice to terminate the tenancy as of November
30, 2020. This notice failed to provide
the proper sixty (60) day time frame as required by the
Residential Tenancies Act and as a result is invalid.
 
4.    
The Landlord attempted
to re-rent the unit for December 1, 2020 but was not able to locate a new Tenant
until January 1, 2021. As such the Tenant remains
responsible for the month of
December 2020.
 
5.    
The lawful
monthly rent was
$1,762.95.
 
6.    
The Tenant
has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
7.    
The Tenant paid
a last month’s rent deposit
of $1,725.00. This amount
is being held by
the Landlord and will be applied against any amount determined to be
outstanding.




File Number: CEL-97822-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$1,800.90, which represents the amount of rent
owing up to December 31, 2020, less the last month’s rent deposit.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before January
16, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
