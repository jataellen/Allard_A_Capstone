Order under Sections 69, 30, 31
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Numbers: TNL-03299-18
TNT-00589-17
 
 
GPMI.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict (‘CL’),
(‘DN’) and (‘KE’, the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
The
Tenants applied for an order determining that the Landlord failed to meet the
Landlord's maintenance obligations under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act') or failed to comply with health, safety, housing or maintenance
standards; and that the Landlord, or the Landlord’s agent or superintendent,
harassed, coerced, obstructed, threatened or interfered with the Tenant, or a
member of the Tenant’s household.
 
These
applications were heard in Toronto on April 17, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, LG, the Tenants and the Tenants’
representative, HS, attended the hearing.  The Landlord’s witness
(superintendent), (‘SR’), also attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
The Landlord’s Application
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from January 1, 2018 to April 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective February 1, 2018.
 
2.      At
the hearing, the Tenants agreed with the Landlord’s evidence of the Tenants’
rental arrears for the period ending April 30, 2018.
 
3.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,733.60 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
 
4.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from November 1,
2017 to February 1, 2018.
 
5.      The
Tenants paid $3,116.56 after the application was filed.
 
6.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
7.      At
the hearing, the Tenants testified that they were able to pay the amount that
they owe to the Landlord on or before April 20, 2018.  Because this order is
being issued on May 10, 2018, I find that it is not unfair to give the Tenants
11 days from the date of this order to pay the full amount they owe for the
period ending May 31, 2018.  
 
8.      The
Tenants shall be required to pay the amount they owe to the Landlord on or
before May 21, 2018.
The
Tenants’ Application
9.      The
Tenants did not prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the Landlord failed
to meet its maintenance obligations by failing to address the Tenants’
complaints of rodents, cockroaches and bed bugs.
 
10.   At
the hearing, the Tenants testified that they in fact did not complain to the
Landlord of the presence of rodents, cockroaches and bed bugs after September
2016, when the Landlord treated the rental unit for pests and vermin.  The
Tenant DN explained that a friend who is a lawyer advised the Tenants not to
complain to the Landlord about maintenance and repair issues at the rental
unit.
 
11.   Subsection
30(2) of the Act requires the Board to consider whether before filing an
application about maintenance and repairs the tenant advised the landlord of
the defects.  In McQuestion v. Schneider, 1975 CanLII 764 (ON CA), [1975] O.J. No. 2279
(C.A.), the Court of Appeal for Ontario determined that a landlord is not
liable for maintenance and repair defects, of which the landlord was not
reasonably aware.
 
12.   In
this case, the Tenants agreed at the hearing that, because of the curious
advice they received from a friend who is a lawyer, the Tenants did not inform
the Landlord of maintenance and repair issues at the rental unit before filing their
application with the Board.  Therefore, following subsection 30(2) of the Act
and the Court of Appeal for Ontario’s decision in McQuestion v. Schneider,
I find that the Tenants did not prove that the Landlord failed to meet its
maintenance obligations with respect to the presence of pests in the rental
unit.
 
13.   The
Tenants did not prove that the Landlord failed to address the Tenants’
complaints about a shower leak.  
 
14.   The
Tenants did not inform the Landlord of the leak until the Tenants filed their
application with the Board in late-December 2017.  The Tenant DN testified that
the Landlord repaired the leak in or about January 2018 or February 2018.
 
15.   The
Tenants did not adduce evidence, or make a submission, that the time it took
for the Landlord to repair the shower leak after receiving the Tenants’ T6
application was unreasonable.  I therefore find that the Landlord responded in
a timely manner when it learned of the leaking shower.  Accordingly, the
Landlord did not fail to meet its duty to maintain and repair the leaking
shower.
 
16.   DN
testified that the Landlord addressed an issue with the furnace on the same day
that the Tenants made their complaint to the Landlord.  The Landlord therefore
met its duty to maintain and repair the furnace.
 
17.   DN
similarly testified that the Landlord repaired a closet door after the Landlord
became aware of the issue.  DN could not, however, recall the dates when she
informed the Landlord of the issue, or when the Landlord did the repair work.
 
18.   The
Tenants did not prove that the Landlord failed to respond to the Tenants’
complaints of the possible presence of mould at the rental unit.  DN could not
recall at the hearing when, or if, the Tenants advised the Landlord of their
concerns about the possible presence of mould in the rental unit.  The
Landlord, therefore, was not reasonably aware of any potential mould issue at
the rental unit.
 
19.   The
Tenants did not prove that stovetop burners do not function.  DN agreed at the
hearing that the Tenants have not tried to use the burners since approximately
July 26, 2016, after the Landlord had performed maintenance work on the stove. 
The Tenants, therefore, do not know whether the burners function or not.
 
20.   The
Tenants did not prove that the Landlord failed to comply with a property
standard by failing to finish wall repairs by painting the affected areas in a
colour that is compatible with the rest of the walls.
 
21.   The
C of T Property Standards by-law requires repairs and maintenance work to be
done in a manner such that the materials used (including paint) reasonably
match adjoining decorative finishing materials.  I interpret this requirement
to include wall paint.  That is, I find that the C of T Property Standards
by-law requires landlords to paint walls in a matching colour, when it is
reasonably possible to do so.
 
22.   At
the hearing, the Tenants adduced evidence that the Landlord was required to put
holes in walls to resolve a leak.  Although the Landlord repaired the surface
of the walls, the Landlord did not paint the areas affected by the work in a
colour that matches the surrounding areas.  The Landlord finished its work on
the rental unit’s walls by leaving the affected areas white.  At some time
during the tenancy, however, the Tenants painted the rental unit’s walls
pink.   
 
23.   At
the hearing, the Tenants testified that a former superintendent, who is no
longer employed by the Landlord, gave verbal permission to the Tenants to paint
the rental unit pink.  Even if, however, the Tenants had the Landlord’s
superintendent’s permission to paint the walls pink, I find that it would be
unreasonable under the circumstances to order the Landlord to try to match the wall
colour.  
 
24.   I
therefore conclude that the Landlord did not fail to meet a property standard
when the Landlord did not finish its wall repairs in a shade of pink that
matches the rest of the rental unit.
 
25.   The
Tenants did not prove that the Landlord, or the Landlord’s agent or
superintendent,
harassed, coerced, obstructed, threatened or interfered with the Tenant, or a
member of the Tenant’s household, by asking the Tenants to remove empty beer
bottles from the Tenants’ yard.  
 
26.   DN’s
evidence of the superintendent SR’s attempts to communicate with the Tenants
via text message and telephone calls was vague.  DN was not able to reliably
recall the number of text messages and telephone calls SR made, and was also
not able to recall the approximate dates of the text messages and telephone
calls.  Furthermore, there was no evidence to determine that the content of the
text messages or telephone calls was inappropriate or unreasonable.  
 
27.   I
therefore find that the Tenants did not adduce reliable evidence of harassment,
coercion, obstruction, threats or interference from the Landlord’s
superintendent.
 
28.   Because
the Tenants did not prove that the Landlord failed to meet its maintenance
obligations under the Act, and also did not prove that the Landlord’s
superintendent harassed, coerced, obstructed, threatened or interfered
with the Tenant, or a member of the Tenant’s household, the Tenants’
application must be dismissed.
It is ordered that:
 
The Landlord’s Application
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before May 21, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $784.89*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to May 10, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $57.00 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting May 11, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May 21,
2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from May 22, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before May 21, 2018, then starting May 22, 2018,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 22, 2018.
 
8.      If,
on or before May 21, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $3,984.90** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after May 22, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
The
Tenants’ Application
10.   The
Tenants’ application is dismissed.
