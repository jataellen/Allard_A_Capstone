Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number: EAL-97199-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
1086 QUARRY ROAD OTTAWA ON K1K0S3


 




Between:


Manor Park
Estates/Manor Park Mgmt


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Richard Lamadeleine


Tenant



 
 
 
Manor Park Estates/Manor Park
Mgmt (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Richard
Lamadeleine (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 18, 2022. The Landlord’s Agent Nelson Lamoureux and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
January 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August
11, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
As of January 1, 2022,
the monthly rent for the unit is
$1,083.84.
 
4.    
The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,030.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 15, 2018 to January 1, 2022.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant and find that
it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 28, 2022
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.




File Number: EAL-97199-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $6,047.71*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
26, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $35.63
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 27, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 28, 2022, then starting
March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)  
$7,463.40 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022,
or
ii)  
$8,547.24 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after March
1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
