and


 




 


Najwa Jawhari
  Roy Ghosn


Tenants



 
 
 
10-12 St. Dennis Drive Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Najwa Jawhari and Roy Ghosn (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the
rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 12, 2022. The Landlord's Legal Representative,
Richard Hissey attended the hearing. The Tenants were not present or
represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from October 1, 2020 to September
30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective April 19, 2021.
 
2.     The application is amended to reflect the rent arrears
that is owed.
 
3.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
4.    
The lawful monthly rent is $1,008.72.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $987.01 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from October
1, 2019 to April 19, 2021.
 
7.     The Tenants paid $8,059.60 after the application was filed.




 
8.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of
the rental unit on or before
February 27, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $2,448.78*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
16, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$33.16 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 17,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
27, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 28, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 27, 2022, then starting
February 28, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 28, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before February 27,
2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $4,062.45** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 28, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
February 16, 2022
