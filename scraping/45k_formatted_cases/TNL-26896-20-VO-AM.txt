Amended Order under Subsection 74(14)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-26896-20-VO-AM
 
 



In the matter
of:


79 MORGAN AVENUE MARKHAM ON L3T1R5


 




Between:


Alleghe Mortgage Fund
  Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Ali Mansoor Zarmina Mansoor


Tenants



 
 
 
This order originally issued on January
5, 2021. It subsequently came to the attention of the Landlord and Tenant Board (the ‘Board’)
that the Landlord
had been incorrectly named. The order is
amended to correct this clerical error to provide greater clarity to the
parties. The amended portion is bolded
and underlined for ease of reference.
 
 
Ali Mansoor and Zarmina Mansoor (the 'Tenants') filed a motion to
set aside order TNL-26896-20 because, before the eviction order was enforced,
the Tenants paid the amount required under subsection 74(11) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') to void the order.
 
This motion was heard via videoconference on December 1, 2021. The
Landlord’s legal representative, D. Fenig, and the Tenant, Z. Mansoor, attended
the hearing. Z. Mansoor had an opportunity to speak with Tenant Duty Counsel
before the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants
have not previously made a motion
under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside an eviction order during the
period of the Tenants' tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
2.    
The Tenants
have paid $20,975.00 to the Board.
 
3.    
The Landlord’s legal
representative submitted that the amount required to void should be inclusive
of interest. As such, the Tenants may not have paid the amount required under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to void the eviction order by September 14, 2021.
 
4.    
Section 74(11)
states as follows:




 
A tenant may make a motion
to the Board, on notice
to the landlord, to set aside an eviction order referred to in subsection
(3)  if, after the
order becomes enforceable but before it is executed, the tenant pays an amount
to the landlord or to the Board and files an affidavit sworn by the tenant stating
that the amount,
together with any amounts previously paid to the landlord or to the Board, is at least
the sum of the following amounts:
 
1.   The amount
of rent that is in arrears under the tenancy
agreement.
2.    The
amount of additional rent that would have been due under the tenancy agreement
as at the date of payment by the tenant had notice of termination not been
given.
3.    The
amount of NSF cheque charges charged by financial institutions to the landlord
in respect of cheques tendered to the
landlord by or on behalf of the tenant, as allowed by the Board in an application by the landlord
under section 87.
4.   The amount
of administration charges
payable by the tenant for the NSF cheques, as allowed by the Board in
an application by the landlord under section 87.
5.   The costs ordered by the Board.
 
5.    
Section 74(11)
does not state
that the amount
to void is inclusive of interest. As such, I find
the Tenants have paid to the Landlord
the amount required
under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to void the
eviction order by September 14, 2021.
 
6.    
The Landlord
has not incurred
a fee under the Administration of Justice Act for the purpose
of enforcing the Landlord's eviction order.
 
7.    
The Tenants cannot make another motion under subsection
74(11) of the Act to set
aside an eviction order during the period of the Tenants' tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order TNL-26896-20 is void and cannot be enforced by the Landlord.
 
2.    
The amount of
$20,975.00 paid into the Board by the Tenants shall be paid out to the Landlord.
