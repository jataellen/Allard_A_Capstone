Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-07120-19
 










 
 
 

L1
Application 
 
M.B.M
G of C Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict J (J) M and K M (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent
that the Tenants owe. The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges and related
administration charges. 
 
L2
Application 
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenants because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they
permitted in the residential complex have:
•        
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant;
•        
wilfully
or negligently caused undue damage to the premises; and
•        
seriously impaired the safety of any person. 
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenants because they have been persistently late in
paying their rent.
 
The
Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenants to compensate the
Landlord for the damage. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date as well as NSF cheque charges and related administration
charges.
 
This
combined L1/L2 application was heard in Toronto on September 12, 2019.
 
The
Landlord’s representative, P S, and the Landlord’s legal representative, B L S,
attended the hearing. 
 
The
Tenants failed to attend despite the Board serving a Notice of Hearing on all
parties that indicated the time, place and purpose of the hearing. There was no
record before me of a request to adjourn. In spite of this, I waited 30
minutes. When the Tenants still failed to attend, I proceeded to determine the
application on the basis of the materials before me. 
 
Determinations:
 
L1
Application 
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the
period from February 20, 2019 to September 19, 2019.  Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective May 28, 2019.
 
2.      The
Landlord is entitled to $162.00 to reimburse the Landlord for charges the
Landlord incurred as a result of cheques tendered by or on behalf of the Tenants
which were returned NSF and related administration charges.
 
3.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $2,000.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
4.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from December 19,
2018 to May 28, 2019.
L2 Application 
Allegations
in the N8 Notice of Termination 
 
5.      The
tenancy started on December 20, 2018. The rent is due on the 20th
day of the month. The Tenants paid the rent for January 2019 on January 24,
2019. Since then, the Tenants have not paid the Landlord any rent. Therefore, I
am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Tenants have persistently
paid the rent late. 
 
Allegations
in the N5 Notice of Termination
 
6.      The
Landlord’s claim for substantial interference due to excessive noise is
dismissed because I am not satisfied that the Tenants failed to void this
portion of the N5 Notice pursuant to section 64(3) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”). The voiding period ran from May 15, 2019
to May 21, 2019. The Landlord’s representative testified that she believed that
the Landlord received a noise complaint about the Tenants during this period; however,
she had no specific information about this complaint, including the date it was
received.
 
7.      The
Landlord proved its claim for wilful or negligent damage. Based on the
Landlord’s uncontested evidence, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities
that the Tenants damaged the drywall behind the door leading from the second floor
to the third floor of the residential complex as well as the handle for that
door. This damage was caused when the Tenants threw the door open, slamming it into
the wall behind the door. The Landlord incurred $282.50 ($250.00 + HST) to fix
this damage. The Tenant did not void this portion of the N5 Notice pursuant to
section 62(3) of the Act by repairing/replacing this damaged property or paying
the Landlord’s reasonable cost of repairing/replacing the property.
 
Allegations
in the N7 Notice
 
8.      The
Landlord’s claim for serious impairment of safety is dismissed because the
description of the event from April 7, 2019, which is the basis for this claim,
does not accurately reflect what happened that day, as demonstrated in a video
of the event. The N7 Notice states that on April 7th the Tenants
forced two women into their premises. However, the video footage shows a fight
between the Tenants with two women involved to the extent that they enter and
exit the rental unit at different periods and bang and kick the unit door. The
Tenants are never seen forcing women into their unit. Since the N7 Notice does
not accurately describe the reasons and details respecting termination as
required by section 43 of the Act, this claim is dismissed.
 
9.      The
Landlord’s claim for wilful damage to the drywall and door handle is granted
for the reasons set out in paragraph 7 above. 
 
Compensation
for damage 
 
10.   In
accordance with section 89 of the Act, the Tenants are ordered to pay the
Landlord $282.50 for the reasonable costs of repairing or replacing the damage
drywall and door handle, which the Landlord has incurred.
 
Section
83 considerations 
 
11.   The
Tenants did not attend the hearing to present evidence or submissions in
support of granting relief from eviction. Accordingly, I have considered all of
the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Pursuant
to the L2 Application, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated, as of September 28, 2019. The Tenants must move out of the rental
unit on or before September 28, 2019.
 
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $12,101.81*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to September 17, 2019 and the total charges
related to NSF cheques tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenants,
less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $282.50 for the reasonable cost of
repairing or replacing the drywall and door handle, which the Landlord
incurred.
 
5.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $65.75 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting September 18, 2019 to the date the Tenants move out of
the unit.
 
6.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before
September 28, 2019, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be
simple interest calculated from September 29, 2019 at 3.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
7.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before September 28, 2019, then starting
September 29, 2019, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after September 29,
2019.
