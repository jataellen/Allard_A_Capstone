Order under Sections 30 and 31
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOT-35727-19
 
 
 
SD and (‘SS’) (the 'Tenants')
applied for an order determining that RVPI, HD and JD (the 'Landlords') failed
to meet the Landlords' maintenance obligations under the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
that the Landlords
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or
residential complex by them and that the Landlords withheld or deliberately
interfered with the reasonable supply of a vital service that the Landlords are
obligated to supply under the tenancy agreement.
 
This application was heard on June 16,
2021 in VC75 and
on July 22, 2021
in Passcode 215 965 491 VC 75. The Tenants and the Tenants’
representative, (‘AB-S’), attended the hearing on June 16, 2021 and only the
Tenants’ representative, AB-S, attended the hearing on July 22, 2021.
 
This application is one of 16
related tenant applications against the Landlords concerning the effective shut down of a mobile
home park and certain maintenance and repair issues
leading up to the time of the
effective shut down. The park was
known as RVP (the ‘Park’)
 
Refer to order NOT-33990-18-HR (the ‘Base Order’)
issued February 1, 2022, concurrently with this and the other 14 related individual Tenant
applications. That order sets out my determinations on the liability of the
Landlords pertaining to events leading up to the Park’s closure and the
availability of remedies related to the closure itself.
 
The application under file number NOT-33990-18 was a
multi-tenant T2 application brought
on behalf of fifteen
tenants identified in Schedule 1 to that order (‘Park
Tenants’), seeking relief for
the discontinuance of power to the Park. A
separate T6 application and/or T2 application was brought by each of the
fifteen Park Tenants, seeking relief for the Landlords’ actions and inactions
pertaining to the Park’s water supply, the Park’s sewage system and the
effective closure of the Park. This application under file NOT-35727-19 is one
of those applications.




 
 
 
The hearing of issues common to
all of the applications, meaning common to the application under file number NOT-33990-18 and the fifteen
individual applications, proceeded
to completion on July 22,
2022 in Passcode 215 965 491 VC 75 following a number of earlier appearances.
The hearing of the Tenant’s individual issues under file number NOT-35727-19 proceeded on June 16,
2019. The procedural history is set out in the Base Order.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
As set out in the Base Order, I find that that:
 
a)    
The Landlords withheld or interfered with the provision
of electricity, a vital service;
 
b)    
The Landlords failed to repair or maintain the Park’s sewage
system, allowing problems with sewage discharges and
significant odours over a period that extends back prior to one year prior to
the Tenant’s application filing in March 2019;
 
c)      The Landlords failed
to repair or maintain the Park’s water
system such that the supply of potable water was compromised
for roughly two weeks at the beginning of
March 2018 and throughout the period June through October 2018;
 
d)    
The Landlords’ failures substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
of the units and the Park by
the Tenants, both prior to and after October 2018; and
 
e)    
The above failures, combined with
the Landlords’ decision to cease providing all services at the Park as of October, 2018, attract various
remedies, some pertaining to events leading up to the October 2018 effective closure and
pertaining to events following that effective closure.
 
2.    The Tenants claim for two classes of remedies: first,
those attributable to the wrongdoing of the Landlords prior to the
Park’s effective closure in October 2018; and second; those attributable to the
closure.
 
3.   
I
find the following facts on the basis of the uncontroverted testimony of the Tenant
SS and, where indicated, my review of materials provided at Tab N of the
Tenants’ productions;
 
a)    
The Tenants had lived at the Park for many years before she vacated
near the end of October 2018,
further to the Landlords’ notice
of the impending power shut down and Park closure;
 
b)    
The Tenants paid rent of
$287.97 per month at the Park
until May 2018. They paid no
rent after May 2018;
 
c)     
The Tenants suffered anxiety
from the several
letters and notices
from Algoma Public Health because of the Landlords’ failure
to address the sewage system;




 
d)    
The Tenants were negatively affected by the water and sewage problems. They purchased their own water beginning in May 2018, at a cost
of $437.50;
 
e)     The Tenants contributed $45.00 to the cost of repair to the transformer at the Park in
2018;
 
f)      
The Tenants incurred $409.63
in moving costs
(refer Tab N-3 of Tenants productions);
 
g)    
The Tenants moved to the home of one of the Tenants’ parents.
They paid utilities and property taxes there,
at a estimated cost of $100.00 higher
than the rent at the Park; and
 
h)     The Tenant suffered
a loss of more than $15,000.00 in the value of the
trailer.
First Type of Remedies
- for the Period Prior
to October 30 2018
 
4.    For the first type of remedies, I have considered
compensation for events occurring between March 15, 2018, being one year prior to when
this application was filed, and the
end of October 2018, when the Tenants vacated the Park.
 
5.    I find that the Tenants are entitled to recovery of
the $437.50 they spent on water purchase. In light of this compensation, however,
I find the Tenants are not also entitled to a rent rebate for the water problems.
 
6.   
I find that the Tenants are
entitled to a rebate of $71.99, being 10% of the of the $287.97 monthly rent
which they paid at the Park for 2 ½ months period from mid-March 2018 (being
one year before the filing of the application) through May 2018 (after which
the Tenants stopped paying
rent) for the impacts of the Landlords’ failure to maintain
or repair the sewage system.
 
7.    I find that the Tenants
are entitled to $45.00 in compensation for their contribution to the electric
transformer repair work.
 
Second Type of Remedies - Pursuant to the Park Closure
 
8.   
For the second type of remedies,
as set out in the Base Order, I find
the following:
 
a)    
The Tenants are not entitled to compensation for the loss of value of the value of the
mobile home;
 
b)     The Tenants are entitled to compensation for increased rent for the period between the time they
vacated the park and July 31, 2019;
 
c)     
The Tenants are entitled
to compensation for moving costs;
and
 
d)    
The Tenants may be entitled to damages for interference with reasonable enjoyment.




 
9.   
I
find that the Tenants are entitled to $900.00 for their rent cost increase
during the 9 months between when they left the Park
and July 31, 2019.
 
10. I find that the Tenants
are entitled to $409.63 for moving costs.
 
11. I considered whether to award the Tenants damages for
interference with reasonable enjoyment. I recognize
that it is likely that the months leading up to the Tenants decision to vacate would have been
difficult for the Tenants.. However,
I note that the Tenants withheld rent payment for the months of June through
October 2018. I find that an
additional damages award is not warranted in the circumstances.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlords shall pay to the Tenants a total of $1,864.19, representing payment for the following:
 
a)     rent abatement of $71.99 for the impacts
of the problems with the sewage system;
 
b)     $437.50 for costs
of water;
 
c)      $45.00 compensation for the Tenants’
contribution to the transformer repair;
 
d)     $900.00 for rental
increase; and
 
e)     $409.63 for moving costs.
 
2.    
The Landlords shall pay the Tenants
the full amount owing by March 31, 2022.
 
3.    
If the Landlords do not pay the
Tenants the full amount owing by March 31, 2022 the Landlords will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from April 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
