Marelyn Leggieri


 



 
 
Mandeep Saran
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Marelyn Leggieri (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the
rent the Tenant owes because the
Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on
August 25, 2021 with respect to application TSL-22143-21.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved by order TSL-24823-21,
issued on August 25, 2021. The Tenant
filed a motion to set aside order TSL-24823-21.
 
This motion
was heard by video conference on January 12, 2022. The Landlord and the Tenant
attended the hearing. The Tenant spoke with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     Order TSL-22143-21 provided that the Landlord could
apply to the Board under section 78
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the
Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet
certain conditions specified in the order.
 
2.     The Landlord filed the application under section 78 of
the Act, alleging that the Tenant failed to pay $500.00 on September 24, 2021;
$500.00 on October 1, 2021; $500.00 on October
8, 2021; and $471.00 on October 14, 2021, contrary
to order TSL-22143-21. This resulted in the issuance of ex parte order TSL-24823-21
terminating the tenancy.
 
3.     In support of the motion
to set aside the order, the Tenant testified that she failed to make
the payments because her husband carried out repairs in the rental unit for
which the Landlord agreed to a payment of $850.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant, who
moved into the rental unit in May 2020, admitted that she has not paid any rent
to the Landlord since October 15, 2021 (the rent is due on the 15th of each month). The parties
agree that the last payment
made by the Tenant in the amount
of
$400.00 was made on September 18, 2021.

5.    
The Landlord testified that he
agreed to pay the Tenant’s husband for work carried out in the unit in the
amount of $850.00 but the work was not completed. However, at no time did he
agree to deduct that payment from the arrears.
 
6.     Based on all the evidence, I find that the Tenant
breached the order to make the payments outlined in paragraph 2 above. Although the Tenant claimed that the
Landlord agreed to deduct the $850.00 payment owed her husband from the
arrears, the Tenant provided no evidence to substantiate her claim which the
Landlord denied. Therefore, I find the agreement regarding the repairs separate from the Tenant’s breach of order
TSL- 22143-21. Even if for the sake of argument the Tenant’s evidence
was accepted and
$850.00 deducted from the arrears, the Tenant still owes the Landlord for
the period ending October 14, 2021 and is still in breach of the order.
 
7.    
I
have considered all the disclosed
circumstances in accordance
with subsection 78(11)
(b) of the Act and
find that it would be unfair to grant the Tenant’s
motion. The Tenant did not
propose a reasonable plan for the payment of the outstanding amount and was
instead fixated on her position regarding the $850.00 the Landlord allegedly
owes her husband.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The motion to set
aside order TSL-24823-21, issued on August 25, 2021, is denied. The order is
confirmed and remains unchanged.
 
2.    
The stay of order TSL-24823-21 is lifted on January 31, 2022.
