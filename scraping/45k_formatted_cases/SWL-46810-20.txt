Between:


Cambridge Non-profit Housing

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


John (a.k.a. Jack)
  Keith


Tenant



 
 
 
Cambridge Non-profit Housing Corp. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict John (a.k.a. Jack) Keith (the 'Tenant') The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination
date.
 
This application was heard by video conference on November 1, 2021.
 
At 11:00 am,
Cathy Shafe the Landlord, Peter Schroeder, the Landlord’s Representative and
Laura Shewerl the Landlord’s Witness attended the hearing. The Tenants were neither present nor represented at the hearing.
 
Determinations and Reasons:
 
1.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
2.    
The rental unit is a 1-bedroom
apartment in a mulit-unit complex.
 
3.     The tenancy began
on or about July 2017.
 
First and Second N5 Notices
 
4.    
On August 11, 2020, the
Landlord served the Tenant with a N5 Notice alleging that between April 2, 2020
and August 9,2020, the Tenant substantially interfered with another tenant’s or
the Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex and/or lawful
rights, privileges, or interests by repeatedly throwing
peanuts, cigarette butts and
dirty water on the patio below. There is also an allegation that the Tenant
“rages” at the Tenants in the lower unit.
5.    
Section 68(1) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’) states: A landlord may
give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy if,




 
 
 
(a)  
a notice
of termination was given to the tenant
under section 62, 64 or 67, and
 
(b)   more than seven days but less than six months after the notice mentioned in clause
(a)  
was given to the
tenant, an activity takes place, conduct occurs or a situation arises that constitutes grounds
for a notice of termination under section 60, 61, 62, 64
or 67, other than an activity, conduct or a situation that is described in
subsection 61(1) and that involves an illegal act, trade, business or
occupation described in clause 61(2) (a).
 
 
6.    
Pursuant to section
68(1) of the Act, on October 28,
2020, the Tenant was served with a
second N5 Notice. The Landlord’s
application is based on the second N5 Notice. Accordingly, the Landlord need not prove the truthfulness of the allegations in the first N5
Notice, only that it meets the statutory requirements contained in section 64
of the Act. I am satisfied that it
does. The allegations in this notice include the throwing peanuts off the
balcony to the patio below, threatening notes to other Tenants and verbal
abuse.
 
7.    
I acknowledge it would be prejudicial to a tenant
if the allegations in a first N5 Notice were without any foundation and made
simply for the purpose of allowing a landlord to serve a second, non-voidable
notice pursuant to section 68(1). I
am satisfied that is not the case in the matter before me.
 
Testimony and Evidence
 
8.    
The Landlord presented
evidence supporting the allegations contained in the first N5 notice in the form of
handwritten notes, emails
and photos from other
Tenants and office staff.
 
It is well-established law that the Board, as a tribunal
governed by the Statutory Powers Procedure Act (“SPPA”), may
accept and consider hearsay evidence at hearings. The traditional approach to
accepting such evidence is to assign it the weight that it merits.
 
9.    
As the evidence was
uncontested, I find that the submission supports the allegations outlined in the first N5 Notice.
I am, therefore, satisfied that there was a reasonable basis for the Landlord
to serve the first N5 Notice on August 11, 2020. As a result, the Landlord was entitled to serve
the second, non-voidable N5 Notice on October 28, 2020 in accordance with
subsection 68(1)(a).
 
10.  In the second N5 Notice,
the Landlord provides
details in Appendix A regarding an incident that occurred on or about
October 16, 2020.
 
11.  It was the testimony and evidence of the Landlord that on or abut October
16, 2020 the Tenant slid a “disturbing handwritten note” under the door
of another tenant in the residential complex which states:
 
“JUST A NOTE KEEP YOU’RE NOSE OUT OF
MY AFFAIRS SPOKEN WITH
HOUSING, you will be OUT OF HERE LIAR – Love Jack.”




 
Later that evening, the Landlord alleges
that the Tenant knocked
on the same tenant’s door in a threatening manner. The Tenant then returned to his rental
unit and threw peanuts off the balcony onto the patio below which is the same
patio belonging to the tenant as described above.
 
The Landlord said that Police were called and following that visit, the Tenant was verbally abusive to the tenant in the
lower unit, yelling from his balcony.
 
The Landlord
testified and provided
evidence that a second
handwritten note was slid
under the Tenant’s door. The note contained expletive and offensive language.
 
12.  Laura Shewerl
(LS) appeared as a witness
for the Landlord. She testified
that she lives at
the residential complex two units below the Tenant. LS provided testimony on
the issues regarding the Tenant repeatedly throwing peanuts to her patio below
and also threw water on them while they were eating dinner. She stated that she
received the 2 handwritten notes as detailed above that felt threatened by the
Tenant. LS testified that the Tenant is often intoxicated and disruptive to be
around.
 
13.  Based on the uncontested evidence before
me, I am satisfied that the Tenant has substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant.
I am satisfied that the allegations that formed the basis
of the application have been made out on a balance of probabilities.
 
14.  The evidence before me establishes that the
Tenant frequently threw peanuts down onto the
patio below in an effort to disrupt
the neighbouring tenant. The Tenant has also
acted verbally aggressive towards the tenant and others in the residential
complex. The Tenant has been publicly intoxicated and disruptive. As a result of the Tenant’s conduct,
police have attended the residential complex.
 
15. 
The Landlord
and witness testified that the Tenant’s
conduct is disturbing, interfering with
their quiet enjoyment of their homes, and makes them feel unsafe.
 
16.  The Landlord testified that several
attempts at communication and resolution have been made with the Tenant
including written correspondence, phone calls and in person. The Landlord also said she tried to set up a meeting
between the parties
with a mediator on or around spring of 2021. The Tenant did not participate.
 
17.  I asked the parties if a conditional order would be a possible consideration. The Landlord and
Landlord’s Representative indicated that due to the efforts made and the lack
of willingness for the Tenant to participate in the hearing,
an order such as this would not be effective.
 
18.  The Landlord was not aware
of any reason to delay
or deny the eviction.
 
19. 
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until January 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.




 
20.  Although no submissions were made at the
hearing regarding the Tenant’s personal circumstances, based on the timing of this
order, I have delayed eviction
until January 31, 2022.
 
21. 
This order contains all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
January 31, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 31, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,191.33, which represents compensation for the use of the
unit from December 1, 2020 to January 31, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $2.79
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from February 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before February 11, 2022,
the Tenant will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from February 12, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022, then starting
February 1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 1, 2022.
