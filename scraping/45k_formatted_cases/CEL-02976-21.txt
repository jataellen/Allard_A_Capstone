DMS Property Management Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jonathan England (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
17, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Frank Calcagni, attended the hearing. As of 3:11 p.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
21, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
October 19, 2021. The Tenant
was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was
filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1965.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,965.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
October 19, 2021. The Tenant
was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was
filed.




File Number: CEL-02976-21
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,227.45*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to October 19, 2021, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before March 8, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 9, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
