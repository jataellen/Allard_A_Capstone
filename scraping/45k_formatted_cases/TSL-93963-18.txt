Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-93963-18










 

A.H
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict L.Z
(the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for
the purpose of residential occupation. (L2 application)
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order requiring L.Z (the 'Tenant') to pay the rent
that the Tenant owes. (L9 application)
 
This
combined application was heard in Toronto on May 15, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.  Z.L, and S.C
are family members of the Tenant’s and attended with the Tenant as support and
as interpreters for the Tenant.  The Landlord consented to the family
interpretation.  Y.M (YM) also attended the hearing as witness for the
Landlord. 
 
Determinations:
 
L2 application
 
1.     
On March 14, 2018, the Landlord mailed to the Tenant a Notice to
Terminate at End of the Term for Landlord’s or Purchaser’s Own Use (the ‘N12
notice’), for his personal use of rental unit, with a termination date of May
31, 2018.  The N12 notice is for the type of occupancy permitted under
subsection 48(1)(a) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”)
and it meets the 60 day requirement under subsection 48(2) of the Act. 
2.     
The Landlord testified that he rented his
condominium to the Tenant while he was employed in Ottawa.  He further
testified that his employment came to an end and that he and his girlfriend moved
back to Toronto at the end of March 2018 and each moved in with their parents
in order to wait until the rental unit was vacated by the Tenant according to
the N12.  
3.     
The Landlord had very little evidence to
corroborate his move to Toronto:  he produced evidence of terminating his
rental unit in Ottawa, but could produce no corroboration of employment in
Toronto, and his driver’s licence represented his parent’s address, but had no
new address change from an Ottawa address.
4.     
The Landlord testified that he is working in a
family business which is why he has no paperwork showing new employment.  He
also plans for his girlfriend to work in the business once they are living
together again.  
5.     
YM testified that she is the Landlord’s
girlfriend and that her employment in Ottawa ended in September 2017 which was
another factor in the decision to move back to Toronto.  She confirmed that she
plans to work with the Landlord in the family business, but where she is
currently living with her parents is too onerous a commute for work.  She also
confirmed that it is her intention to live with the Landlord in the rental unit
when it is vacated by the Tenant.
6.     
YM produced an email confirmation of her rental
of a moving truck for dates at the end of March from Ottawa to Toronto.
7.     
Evidence by testimony may be corroborated by
documentary evidence, but even when it is not, it is still evidence to be
properly considered.  The Landlord and YM’s evidence was consistent, was not
contradicted by any other evidence before me, and was not shaken on
cross-examination.
8.     
The Tenant testified that she is suspicious of
the Landlord’s motives because of the dispute they have been having with the
Landlord over the N4 served on them, which they did not understand and felt was
a traumatic experience.  The Tenant also received a Notice of Rent Increase in
February to take effect on June 1, 2018, which they acknowledge.  The Tenant
also says she is suspicious that the Landlord is evicting them in order to get
higher rent for the unit.  
9.     
Despite the disagreements concerning the N4, the
Landlord was owed rent by the Tenants and was within his legal rights to serve the
notice.  The Tenant also has remedies pursuant to the Act that can be pursued
if she receives evidence that the Landlord has not moved into the property as
he has expressed he will do.  I therefore find, on a balance of probabilities, that
the Landlord has a genuine intent to move into the rental unit once it is
vacated and to use it for his own residential purposes for at least a year.  
10.  
The Tenant also testified that she is a lone
mother to a 13 year old son, and that she has to travel to China on a frequent
basis.  The rental unit is convenient as her daughter lives in the residential
complex and is available to supervise her brother while she is away.  The
Tenant is very concerned that a disruption to these living arrangements will
have a negative impact on her son, and that to try to replicate the living
arrangements in another residential complex will be very difficult.  
11.  
The Tenant testified that she had hoped to stay
in the unit until her son completed school.  She says she needs at least until
the end of September, 2018 to look for another unit as she is away in China
most of June, and looking in the summer for apartments is difficult.  
12.  
As of the day of the hearing, the Landlord has
not compensated the Tenant in an amount equal to one month’s rent as required
by the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 for Landlord’s own use. I cannot
give an order unless the compensation has been paid, so this order sets off the
payment owed to the Tenant against the arrears awarded on the L9 application.  
13.  
I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until August 31, 2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of
the Act.  The Landlord has housing and will not be prejudiced by a delay to the
eviction, while the Tenant as a lone mother has arrangements to make which
allow for the ongoing care of her son. 
L9 application
14.  
The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit
on the date the application was filed.
15.  
The monthly rent as of the date of the hearing
is $2,300.00.
16.  
The Tenant did not pay the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period from February 1, 2018 to April 30, 2018.
17.  
The Tenant testified and the Landlord
acknowledged that a deposit was held by the Landlord for the months of
December, January and February, which he has applied.  The Landlord also
acknowledged he has received payment for March, so that the only months of rent
outstanding are April and May.  
18.  
The total arrears owing up to April 30, 2018 is
$4,600.00.
19.  
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
It is ordered that:
 
L2 application
 
1.     
The Landlord shall compensate the Tenant with an
amount equal to one month’s rent on or before the date of termination and this
amount has been paid by the set-off of one month’s rent against the arrears
ordered below. 
2.     
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before August
31, 2018.
3.     
If the unit is not vacated on or before August
31, 2018 then starting September 1, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
4.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord on or after September 1, 2018.


 
L9
application
5.     
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,300.00,
which represents the amount of rent owing up to February 28, 2018, less the
compensation (one month rent of $2,300.00) the Tenant is entitled under the Act
for Landlord’s own use.
6.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
7.     
The full amount owing is $2,490.00.
8.     
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing on or before June 15, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe
interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June 16, 2018 at 3.00%
annually on the balance outstanding.
