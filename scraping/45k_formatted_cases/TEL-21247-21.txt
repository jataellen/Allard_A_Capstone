and


 




 


Elizabeth Sabo


Tenant



 
 
 
Toronto Community
Housing Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Elizabeth Sabo (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant failed
to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on June 30, 2021 with respect to
application TEL- 15407-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order:
 
•        
The Tenant
agrees to interact
with the Landlord,
their staff and agents as well as other Tenants in a respectful manner.
On or about November 24, 2021, the building staff reported
an interaction with the Tenant
that day which
cumulated in the Tenant
screaming at the Landlord’s staff in the lobby of the rental complex.
 
•        
The Tenant agrees that they will not place or store any personal
belongings in any of the common areas of the buildings.
On or about December 5, 2021, building staff observed that the Tenant had
placed belongings in the common hallway outside of the unit of her door.
 
•        
The Tenant agreed that the
unit will be brought to an ordinary state of cleanliness as outlined in points 4,5,8
and 11 of the previous order and that they will ensure continued compliance with the aforementioned points. During an inspection of the
rental unit on December 6, 2021, it was observed that pathways throughout the
unit were not clear and accessible. Th balcony continued to be used as storage

housing items that were flammable or combustible. Stacked
items were not reduced to a height of approximately
4 feet and were not stacked
securely.
 
3.    
The Tenant
has failed to comply with the above
conditions and is therefore in breach of the order issued by the Board.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 28, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 29, 2022.

The tenant has until January 27, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 27, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.
