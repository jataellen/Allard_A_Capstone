Toronto Community Housing
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Tammy Barber (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the mediated settlement issued by the Board on February 27, 2020 with respect to application TEL-07001-19.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The mediated settlement provided that the Landlord
could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the
Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the settlement.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following conditions specified in the settlement: The Tenant did not meet the conditions
in the mediation agreement on December 8, 2021 the Tenant was arrested and
charged with Possession of Proceeds of Crime and Traffic.
 
It is ordered that:

the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 18, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January
19, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 19, 2022.
