518, 550 SCARBOROUGH GOLF CLUB ROAD TORONTO ON M1G1H6


 




Between:

Landlord




 


and


 




 


Zakir Mohammed Patel


Tenant



 
Sunder Group of Companies Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Zakir Mohammed Patel (the 'Tenant') because
a) the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted
in the residential complex has
wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises.
 
The Landlord has also applied for
an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage
and compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after
the termination date.
 
This application was heard via video/teleconference on October 19, 2021.
 
The Landlord's Legal Representative Geoff Paine and the Tenant attended
the hearing. The Tenant spoke with Duty Counsel prior
to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The residential complex
is a high-rise multi unit apartment.
2.    
On June 15, 2021 the building
property management company responded to a flooding incident in Unit #418. It was later determined that the source of the flood originated in the
Tenants’ rental unit #518.
 
3.    
The Landlord inspected unit #518 and the Tenant
claimed that the daughter (an occupant
of the rental unit) had spilled a ‘large’ amount of water in the rental unit.
The Tenant was not home at the time of the incident.
 
4.     The Landlord’s Agent
asserts the Landlord
incurred costs of $2,090.50 to repair the damage to both units.
 
5.     On June 30, 2021 the Landlord gave the Tenant a first N5 notice alleging
that the Tenant has negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit
and to another unit of the residential complex and requested the Tenant to pay
for the cost of the damage repairs.




 
 
6.    
Subsection 64(1) of the Residential Tenancies
Act states:
“A landlord may give a tenant
notice of termination of the tenancy if the conduct of the tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the tenant
substantially interferes with the lawful
right, privilege or interest of the landlord
or another tenant.”
 
7.     Section 64(3) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2006,
(the ‘Act’) provides that the type of N5 Notice served by the Landlord is void
if the Tenant, within seven (7) days after receiving the notice stops the
activity or corrects the conduct/behaviour. In this case, the N5 was served on June 30, 2021, which
means the seven
(7) day voiding
period ran from July 1, 2021 to July 6, 2021.
 
8.    
The Tenant did not pay the Landlord for the cost of the damage repairs.
 
9.    
The Landlord's Legal Representative submitted photographs and
a copy of the damage report and invoice breakdown of the charge back to the
Landlord for the cost to repair in the respective other units:
•        
$508.50 to the Tenants’
Unit #518
•        
$1,582.00 to Unit #418
•        
$2,090.50**
 
10.  The Tenant acknowledged that water was spilled on the
floor of the rental unit but disputed the amount of water and that it resulted
in the stated damage and attempted to raise other issues of maintenance. It
was noted that the Tenant had not filed an application with the Board over problems
for outstanding maintenance complaints made to
the Landlord.
 
11.  Section 89 (1) of the Act provides, that a landlord
may apply to the Board for an order requiring a tenant to pay reasonable costs
that the landlord has incurred or will incur for the repair of or, where repairing is not reasonable, the replacement of damaged property, if the tenant, another occupant
of the rental unit or a person whom the tenant permits in the residential
complex wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to the rental unit or the
residential complex.
 
12.  This wording means that a landlord must establish that it is more likely
than not that the
tenant, an occupant or a guest, wilfully or negligently caused each item of the
property damage claimed.
 
13.  I reviewed the Landlord’s documents submitted and I am
satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, the Tenant,
or another occupant
of the rental unit
negligently caused undue damage to the residential complex
and the Landlord has incurred costs of $2,090.50 to repair the damage and/or
replace property that was damaged and cannot be reasonably repaired.
 
14.  The Landlord seeks
payment for the damage and a standard
order to terminate the tenancy.




 
 
 
15.  Terminating a tenancy
should always be the last resort. In this instance,
the damage was not wilful, deliberate but rather
caused by negligence.
 
16.  All in all, after having considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
I find that it would not
be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in
this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. The Tenant
shall be permitted additional time to pay for the damages incurred.
 
17.  The order contains
all the reasons for the decisions within
the order. No other reasons will be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$2,090.50, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage and/or
replacing the damaged property.
 
2.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay the total amount owing**
to the Landlord on or before
March 31, 2022.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing on or before March 31, 2022, the Landlord
may apply to the Board under section
78 of the Act, without notice to the Tenant,
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before
March 31, 2022, he will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from April 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before March 31, 2022, the Landlord
has the right anytime after April 1, 2022 to collect from the Tenant the amount owing or any outstanding
balance as a result of this order.
