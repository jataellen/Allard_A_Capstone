Act, 2006

In the
  matter of:


1101, 15 BROOKBANKS DRIVE TORONTO ON M3A2T1


 




Between:


Hardit Corporation


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Sue-Ann Gray


Tenant



 
 
 
Hardit Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sue- ann Gray (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on
May 21, 2021 with respect to application TNL-24981-20.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved by order TNL-33106-21, issued on July 6, 2021. The Tenant filed a motion to set
aside order TNL-33106-21.
 
This motion was heard by videoconference September 28, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s legal representative Faith McGregor and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
The Landlord’s witness and property manager Anna Sandru (“AS”) also
attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     Order TNL-24981-20 required that the Tenant pay the
May 2021 rent on or before May 31, 2021 and to pay the lawful
monthly rent in full and on time on or before the first of the
month for the period June 1, 2021 to May 31, 2022.
 
2.    
It is uncontested that the Tenant breached a condition of order TNL-33106-21 by failing to pay the rent for May 2021 on or before
May 31, 2021 and by failing to pay the rent for June 2021 on or before June 1,
2021.
 
3.     I therefore find that the Tenant breached order
TNL-24981-20 issued May 21, 2021 by failing
to pay the May 2021 rent on or before
May 31, 2021 and by failing to pay the June
2021 rent on or before June 1, 2021.




 
Relief from Eviction
 
4.     The Tenant testified
that she did not make the payments
for May and June as required
because she did not receive a copy of the order until June 10, 2021.
 
5.     The Tenant testified
that she made a payment
on June 28, and that this payment
was intended to pay the rent for July 2021.
 
6.     While I accept
the Tenant’s evidence
that she did not receive
the order, the Tenant failed to address why she waited 18 days
before making a payment after receiving the order and failed to address why she
did not pay the May or June 2021 rent after becoming aware of the order.
 
7.     The Tenant testified
that she has utilized the Landlord’s online
portal called “Rent Café”
to make her rent payments and payments towards arrears of rent.
 
8.     The Tenant also testified that she believed
that a payment she made on July 30th was intended to pay the
August 2021 rent.
 
9.     There is no dispute that the September
2021 rent was paid on time on the first of
September.
 
10.  The Landlord, through
their witness, AS, testified that within the “Rent Café” portal, the Tenant can select which month to
apply payments to.
 
11.  AS further testified that the Tenant is in substantial
arrears of rent and that payments made by the Tenant were applied to the oldest
amount of arrears outstanding as the Tenant did not specify in “Rent Café” to
whether the payments were to be applied towards arrears or rent. AS testified
that the Tenant
can select the rent or arrears and elected not to.
 
12.  AS testified that the Tenant
failed to pay the May, June, July and August
rent on time and that this causes prejudice to the Landlord as the Tenant not only pays rent late
but she is also in substantial arrears of rent.
 
13.  Although I cannot consider the arrears as part of the
Landlord’s application, subsection 78(11)(b)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’), requires that I consider
all of the circumstances in
determining whether it would not be unfair to set aside the order.
 
14.  Based on the fact that the Tenant
failed to pay, May and June rent al all and based
on the evidence that the
Tenant failed to pay July and August rent on time and based on the history of
late payments of the Tenant, I find that it would be unfair to grant the
Tenant’s motion to set aside order TNL-33106-21, issued on July 6, 2021




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The motion to set aside Order TNL-33106-21, issued on July 6, 2021, is denied.
 
2.     The stay of order TNL-33106-21 is lifted immediately.

47 Sheppard Avenue East, Suite 700, 7th Floor Toronto ON M2N5X5
