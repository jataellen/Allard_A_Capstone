1804384 Ontario Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Denise Prieur (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 11, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal
Representative, Francisco Gomez, attended the hearing. As of 11:05 a.m., the
Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the
Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
November 15, 2020 to January
14, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective September 2, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on
October 15, 2021. The Tenant
was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was
filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,246.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,200.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 7, 2017 to September 2, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of October
15, 2021, the date the Tenant returned
vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.




File Number: SOL-24469-21
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $5,175.43*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to October
15, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
30, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 31, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
