Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Garner Vince Gayle


Tenant



 
 
 
This amended order is issued on
my own motion to correct
a clerical error in the original
order issued February 4, 2022. For
ease of reference, the amendment in paragraph 2 of the determinations has been
underlined. The Order is otherwise
unaltered.
 
On January 20, 2022, Pinedale
Properties Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Garner Vince Gayle (the 'Tenant')
and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the
Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on
November 26, 2021 with respect to application TNL-34070-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $1145.77 rent on or before January
1, 2022. The Tenant did not
pay $500.00 arrears on or before January 16, 2022.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $5,995.86 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order TNL-34070-21. The amount that is still owing from that




 
order is $5,481.05 and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous
order TNL-34070-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed
to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from January 1, 2022 to February 28, 2022.
 
6.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,131.74 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 1, 2020
to February 4, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TNL-34070-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 15, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,644.63*.(Less
any amount paid since the application was filed on January 20, 2022.) This
amount represents the rent owing up to February 4, 2022 and the costs
related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$37.67 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 5, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
15, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 15, 2022, then starting
February 16, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 16, 2022.

The tenant has until February 14, 2022
to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by February 14, 2022 the order will be stayed and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81
of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on August 16, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
