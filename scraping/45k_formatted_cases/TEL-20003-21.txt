Properties LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jerry Lee and Brent Trotter

the Tenants did not pay the
rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 26, 2022. As

although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board. The Landlord’s Agent, Sharon Harris
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to November
30, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination.

The Tenants vacated the rental unit on December
31, 2021. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,466.57.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,439.22 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenants paid $2,300.00 after the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:

3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
