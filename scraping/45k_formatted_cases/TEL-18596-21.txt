and


 




 


Tammy
Pasquale Wayne Turnbull


Tenants



 
 
Eskender
Mekonnen (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Tammy Pasquale and Wayne Turnbull
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on November 17, 2021. Only the Landlord attended the hearing. As of 10:44
a.m., the Tenant
was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from March 1, 2021 to November
30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective July 22, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
vacated the rental
unit on October 7, 2021. The Tenants were in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,658.00.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,658.00 from the
Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
22, 2021 to July 22, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of October
7, 2021, the date the Tenants returned
vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.

2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$5,711.66*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to October 7, 2021, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before December
20, 2021, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from December 21, 2021
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
