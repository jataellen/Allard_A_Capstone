Seija Sekhon (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Claude Parent (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
13, 2022. Only the Landlord
attended the hearing. As of
9:52 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from June 1, 2020 to August 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective April 10, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on
August 28, 2021. The Tenant
was in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.      The lawful monthly
rent was $600.00.
 
4.      The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.      The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Tenancy is terminated as of August 28, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$8,659.46*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to
August 28, 2021.




File Number: NOL-42577-21
 
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     
If the Tenant does
not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January 30, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 31, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
