Order under
Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006


 




 


File Number: SWL-57555-22




 
In the matter
of:


 
304, 645 KIPPS LANE LONDON ON N5Y4R5


 




Between:


Medallion Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Maria Chama


Tenant



 
 
 
On January 12, 2022, Medallion Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied in
this L4 application for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Maria Chama
(the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes
because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the consent order
issued by the Board on June 24, 2021 with respect to L1 application SWL- 46853-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The previous consent order
provided that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the
Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I find that the Tenant has not met
the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenant failed to pay the full lawful
rent for January
2022 plus $774.27
towards the outstanding
arrears on or before January 1, 2022. These
were breaches of paragraphs 4 and 5 of the consent order. This L4 application
was filed within 30 days of the breaches.
 
3.       
The previous L1 application included a request
for an order for the payment
of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant
to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, in this L4 application the Landlord is entitled to request an order
for the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.       
In paragraph 3 of the previous
consent order, the Tenant agreed and was ordered to pay
$8,330.31 for rent arrears and
NSF cheque charges and the costs related to the Landlord's L1 application fee. The amount
that is still owing from that order is $2,692.95 and that amount is included in
this order. As a result, the previous consent order SWL- 46853-20 is cancelled.




 
5.       
Since the date of the order,
the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from November 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.
 
6.       
There was no last month’s rent deposit collected.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The previous consent order SWL-46853-20 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 6, 2022 (standard 11 days from the
issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
If the Tenant made any payments
after this L4 application was filed, those amounts shall be deducted from the calculations
below.
 
See attached
Summary of Calculations
 
4.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4,807.38*.
This amount represents the rent owing up to this order date, January 26, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous L1 application.
 
5.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $24.35 per day for
compensation for the use of the unit starting January 27, 2022 to
the date the Tenant actually moves out of the rental unit or gets evicted.
 
6.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
6, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 7, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 6, 2022, then starting February
7, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 7, 2022.

The tenant has until
February 7, 2022 to file a motion
with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by February 7, 2022 the order will be
stayed and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on August
7, 2022 if the order has not been filed
on or before this date with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the
rental unit is located.
