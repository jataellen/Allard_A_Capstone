Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-66822-17
 
 
CR
SGI (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict KM
and NA (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe and because the Tenants have been persistently late in paying the
rent. 
 
This
application was heard in Mississauga on June 14, 2017.
 
Only the Landlord’s Representative, BR, attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from March 1, 2017 to June 30, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination.
2.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,324.96 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
3.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from April 1, 2017
to June 21, 2017.
4.      The
Tenants paid $1,345.90 after the application was filed.
5.      I
have reviewed the information provided by the Landlord in the N8 notice to End
Your Tenancy at the end of the Term.  I have also considered the uncontroverted
evidence of the Landlord’s Representative with respect to past N4 notices
served on the Tenants. I find that the Tenants have been persistently late in
paying the rent.  
6.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
The Application for Non-Payment of Rent
 
1.      Unless
the Tenants void this part of the eviction order for non-payment of rent as set
out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The
Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before July 2, 2017.
2.      As
of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation
the Landlord is entitled to by $7.44*.
3.      However,
the Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the
Landlord owes the Tenants:
$44.25 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting June 22, 2017
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit, and
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
4.      The
Landlord or the Tenants shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as
a result of this order.
5.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before July 2, 2017, then starting July 3, 2017,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
6.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 3, 2017.
7.      If
the Tenants wish to void this part of the eviction order and continue the
tenancy, they must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $1,928.66 if the payment is made on or before June 30, 2017, or
ii)       $3,274.55 if the payment is made on or before July 2, 2017**.


8.      If,
on or before July 2, 2017 the Tenants pay to the Landlord the amount set out in
paragraph 7 above, this part of the eviction order for non-payment of rent will
be void.  This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants
could remain in the unit until July 31, 2016, when the tenancy will be
terminated for the Tenants’ persistent late payment of rent.  If the payment
under paragraph 7 is not made in full and on time, the landlord may file this
order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced. 
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after July 3, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
The Application for Persistent Late Payment
of Rent
10.   If
the Tenants void the part of this eviction order for non-payment of rent,
above, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated as of
July 31, 2016 for the Tenants’ persistent late payment of rent.  The Tenants
must move out of the rental unit on or before July 31, 2017.
11.   If
the unit is not vacated on or before July 31, 2017, then starting August 1,
2017 the landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
12.   Upon
receipt of this order the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after August 1, 2017.
