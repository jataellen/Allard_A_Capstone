Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-99560-17
 
 
 
 
 
SK (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict JC (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did
not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by teleconference on December 13, 2021.
 
The Landlord,
the Landlord’s legal
representative O. P, the Tenant,
and the Tenant’s legal
representative Y. E attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Background
 
1.    
The Landlord
filed this application in the fall of 2017. A hearing
was held in January 2018 and an order was issued on January
15, 2018. The order was a standard voidable “pay and stay” order.
 
2.    
In May 2018 the Tenant
filed a motion to void the order. The hearing of the Tenant’s motion took place in June 2018. By order issued June 14, 2018, the Board denied the Tenant’s motion.
 
3.    
The Tenant requested a review of the motion order. Her review was denied without
a hearing by order TNL-99560-17-RV, issued July 4, 2018.
 
4.    
The Tenant
appealed the hearing
order issued January
15, 2018, the motion order
issued June 14, 2018 and the review order issued July 4, 2018 to the
Divisional Court. In a decision issued October 6, 2021, the Court found an
error in the motion order, granted
the Tenant’s
appeal, and remitted
“the matter” to the Board for a new hearing.
 
5.    
The Board
scheduled a hearing
for December 13, 2021.




 
Preliminary matter
 
6.    
At the outset of the hearing the Tenant’s legal representative
submitted that “the matter” that was
remitted back to the Board is the original L1 application. She submitted that
all three orders were subject to the appeal
(as per the Tenant’s Amended
Notice of Appeal) and, while the Court could have
limited what they remitted back to the Board to any one of either the L1
application, the motion, or the review, the Court did not. She added that the
Board cannot read in such a limitation.
 
7.    
The Landlord’s legal
representative disagreed. He submitted that in the context of the whole
decision, it is clear that the appeal was granted because of a problem with the
motion order, and so I should draw an inference
that it is the motion that is remitted back to the Board.
 
8.    
These were both good
arguments. However, I find the Tenant’s legal representative’s argument more
persuasive. The appeal was of all orders. That the Court did not mention any
issues that they may have had with the other two orders does not necessarily
mean that the Court only found errors in the one order upon which they focused.
The Court did not limit what was to be remitted back to the Board and I agree
that the Board does not have the authority
to read in such a limitation. When considering how to interpret
a court’s direction to the Board, it is much more prudent
to assume that the Court said exactly
what they intended to say and not to assume that they forgot to say
something.
 
9.    
Accordingly, I found that the matter
remitted back to the Board was the Landlord’s L1 application.
 
L1 application de novo
 
10.  It is uncontested that by March 31, 2021, the Tenant
had paid the full arrears
and the filing fee.
 
11.  Pursuant
to subsection 74(2)
of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’), the Landlord’s application is
discontinued.
 
Future motion under
s.74(11)
 
12.  Subsection 74(12) of the Act provides that
a tenant may not bring a motion under subs. 74(11) of the Act if the tenant has previously made a motion
under that subsection during the tenancy. The Tenant has made a motion under s.74(11)
but the Divisional Court remitted the underlying L1 application back to the
Board. This raises an interesting issue as to whether the Divisional Court
decision nullifies the Tenant’s first motion.
 
13.  This is not an issue that must be decided
in this order and so I leave it to be decided
if the Tenant does seek to
file a motion under s.74(11) during the remainder of the tenancy.
 
Costs




 
14. 
During the course of this lengthy chain of events, the Landlord paid a non-refundable fee to the Sheriff
to enforce the original L1 order, then the Landlord
had to pay a $240.00
fee to re-submit the same order for enforcement.
 
15.  The Tenant had paid for the entire
first fee and had also paid $100.00
toward the second fee prior to the hearing before
me. The Landlord claims the partial cost of the second non-refundable fee.
 
16.  The Tenant (through
her legal representative) consented to an order requiring the Tenant to pay the
remainder of the second fee ($140.00), on condition that the Tenant be given
until the end of February 2022 to pay it.
 
17.  The Landlord’s legal representative did not oppose
delaying payment until
February 28, 2022.
 
18.  I note that the Board has the authority to
order the payment of a non-refundable enforcement fee: see s. 204(2) of the Act and Board order TEL-82636-17-RV, issued October 18, 2017.
 
TNL-10066-18
 
19. 
The parties pointed out
that in October 2018 the Landlord filed another L1 application at the Board with respect
to this tenancy: TNL-10066-18. At this hearing
the parties agreed that the Tenant had paid all arrears
and the fee for this second application as well by the end of March 2021. A separate order
will issue discontinuing TNL-10066-18.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord's application is discontinued.
 
2.    
On or before February 28, 2022, the Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $140.00, which is the remainder of the cost incurred by the Landlord
for a second non-refundable Sheriff’s fee.
