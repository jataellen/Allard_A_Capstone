Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-18912-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


621, 500 DAWES
ROAD TORONTO ON M4B2G1


 




Between:


Havcare Investments Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Toni Northcote


Tenant



 
 
 
Havcare Investments Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Toni Northcote (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on December 7, 2021
at 9:00 a.m.
 
The Landlord,
Carolyn Krebs, and the Tenant, Toni Northcote, attended the hearing. Margaret
Arnason and Diana Demarco, from the City of Toronto
EPIC Program, attended
the hearing as a
support for the Tenant.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from December 1, 2019 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective October 18, 2020.
 
2.    
The Tenant
was in possession of the rental unit when the application was
filed.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is
$893.09
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $893.09 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2020
to October 18, 2020.
 
6.    
The Tenant
paid $12,610.17 after the application was filed.
 
7.    
At the hearing the parties agreed
that the Tenant
owed the Landlord
$2,521.22 including arrears of
rent to December 31, 2021 of $2,335.27 and the application filing fee of




 
$186.00. Since
the hearing another rental period has begun and another month’s rent has become
due. Therefore, the amount in this order includes January’s 2022’s rent. If the Tenant
has paid the Landlord January
2022’s rent, and /or made any payments to the Landlord since the hearing, the Landlord shall deduct those
payments from the amount owing in this order.
 
8.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until February 21, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
The Landlord’s Representative sought a Standard Order. At the hearing, the
Landlord’s was amenable to extending the eviction date to February 21, 2022 in
order to allow the Tenant and Landlord
to settle administrative requirements required to provide the Tenant
with a grant to pay outstanding arrears.
This request has been granted
and the order
has been delayed to February 21, 2022
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 21, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $1,759.22*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
24, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $29.36
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 25, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
23, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 24, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 21, 2022, then starting February
22, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 22, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to
void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
 
i)                   
$3,021.27 if the payment
is made on or before January 31, 2022,
or




 
 
 
ii)                 
$3,914.36 if the payment
is made on or before
February 21, 2022**.
 
 
If the Tenant
does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 22, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period
of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
