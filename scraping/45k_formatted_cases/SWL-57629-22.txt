Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57629-22
 
 



In the
  matter of:


UNIT1, 1677 CHURCH STREET WINDSOR ON N8X1G5


 




Between:


Jian
  Lu


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Andrew Mark William Bobbi Leigh Wayne


Tenants



 
 
 
Jian Lu (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Andrew Mark William and Bobbi Leigh Wayne (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified in the mediated settlement issued by the Board on
December 30, 2021 with respect to application SWL-54652-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The mediated settlement provided that the Landlord
could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the
Tenants did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the settlement.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants
have not met the following
condition specified in the settlement: The Tenant failed to pay the
lawful monthly rent in full, on or before January 1, 2022.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting mediated
settlement required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of
the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The amount that is still owing, according to the terms
of the mediated settlement, for arrears of rent, and the costs related
to the application fee for the previous
application is
$4,406.00.
 
5.     Since the date of the mediated settlement, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that
became owing for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,580.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from June 15, 2021 to February 3, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 14, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlord $4,561.85*. This amount represents the rent owing up to February 3, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$51.95 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 4, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
14, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 15, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 14, 2022, then starting February
15, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 15, 2022.

The tenant has until February 13, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by February 13, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on August 15, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
