Order under
Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number:
SOL-26552-21




In the
matter of:


2, 193 BURRIS
STREET HAMILTON ON L8M2J7


 




Between:


Margaret Parker


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Theresa Mohoney


Tenant



 
On November 15, 2021, Margaret
Parker (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Theresa Mohoney (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on November 2, 2021
with respect to application SOL-23218-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant
if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenant
failed to pay to the Landlord
$200.00 on or before November
1, 2021 towards arrears of
rent. The Tenant paid $100.00.
 
3.       
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$2,361.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application
fee in Order SOL-23218-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $2,261.00
and that amount
is included in this
order. As a result, the previous
order SOL-23218-21 is cancelled.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
Order SOL-23218-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 18, 2022.




File Number: SOL-26552-21
 
3.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,261.00*. This amount represents the rent owing up to November 30, 2021 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application.
 
4.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$46.03 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting December 1, 2021 to
the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
18, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January
19, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 19, 2022.

The tenant has until January 17, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 17, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.
