Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19135-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


UPPER, UNIT 1, 450
SIMCOE ST SOUTH,
UPPER LEVEL STREET S
OSHAWA ON L1H4J6


 




Between:


Joseph Otavnik


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Shawn Hearn


Tenant



 
 
 
Joseph Otavnik (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Shawn Hearn (the 'Tenant') because
the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
18, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord and the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Mark Bottaro, attended
the hearing. As of 11:09
a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord in good faith
requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation. I say this for
the reasons that follow.
 
2.       
The Landlord’s application is
based on a notice of termination issued pursuant to s.48 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act”) alleging the Landlord wishes to live in the rental unit. The notice
is dated August
24, 2021 and sets out a date for termination of the tenancy of
October 31, 2021.
 
3.    
The monthly rent is $1,100.00.
 
4.     The Landlord’s undisputed testimony is that as per his declaration dated January 4, 2022,
he in good faith requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of
residential occupation for at least one year. The Landlord also testified that
the Tenant was given one-month compensation on August 24, 2021 when the N12
notice was served.




 
5.    
The Landlord’s Legal Representative submitted that the Landlord is seeking the 11-day
standard order for eviction as the original termination date on the notice is
well passed and the Landlord wishes to move in as soon as possible. The
Landlord is also seeking compensation from September 2021 as no rent has been
paid since then.
 
6.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Landlord is not aware of any
reasons to delay or deny the eviction and the Tenant did not attend to present
any circumstance to me.
 
7.    
With respect to the compensation, as this order
is based on Landlord’s own use, the compensation ordered can only run from
November 30, 2021, the termination
date indicated in the N12 notice,.
 
8.     This order contains
all the reasons
for the decision
within it. No other reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of February
6, 2022. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 6, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $3,145.92, which represents compensation for the use of the
unit from November 1, 2021 to January 26, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $36.16
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from January 27, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February
6, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 7, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 6, 2022, then starting
February 7, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 7, 2022.
