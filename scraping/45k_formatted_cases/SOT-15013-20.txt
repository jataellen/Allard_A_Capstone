Order under Section 31
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: SOT-15013-20
 



In the matter
of:


57
  KENDRICK COURT ANCASTER ON L9G5A4


 




Between:


Victoria Allen


Tenant




 


and


 




 


Jason Brown


Landlord



 
Victoria Allen (the 'Tenant') applied for an order determining that Jason Brown (the 'Landlord')
harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with the Tenant.
 
This application was heard via video/teleconference on September 22, 2021.
 
The Tenant, the Landlord
and the Landlord's Legal Representative Francisco Gomez attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant asserts
that the Landlord
harassed or interfered with the Tenant,
and that the Tenant gave notice and moved out of
the rental unit because of the Landlord's actions.
 
2.     On February 26, 2020 the Tenant gave the Landlord
a N9 form notice
to terminate the tenancy effective May 1, 2020 and the
Tenant moved out of the rental unit by the termination date set out in the
notice.
 
3.     The Tenant testified
that she was notified that the Landlord
intended to sell the residential complex and would be listing
the property for sale.
 
4.    
The Landlord engaged the services
of a Realtor to list the property for sale that would require photographs being
taken of the rental unit to market the property. The taking of photographs of a property
to effectively market
the property for sale is a normal
process undertaken by Vendors and Realtors.
 
5.    
The Tenant purported that the
Landlord and his Realtor were advised that any photographs taken
were not to be used for the purpose of the sale of the house citing any
public display would be an invasion of her privacy.
 
6.     The property was not publicly
listed for sale until May 4, 2020 and was sold May 6, 2020. The Tenant had moved out and vacated
the rental unit May 1, 2020.




 
7.    
The Tenant provided a photograph taken of the unit livingroom and her furnishings therein.
 
8.     In her application, the Tenant requested
an order requiring
“the Landlord” to pay a rent
abatement and to pay general damages for the public display of her furnishings.
 
9.     On any application before the Board,
the party making
an allegation in an application has the onus of proving those allegations on a balance of
probabilities.
 
10.  The standard of proof requires the party to show with
evidence that, “more likely than not”, their assertions are true and that evidence
“must be sufficiently clear, convincing
and cogent to satisfy the balance of probabilities test.”
 
11.  I find the Tenant’s evidence was insufficient to rise to the level necessary to meet the Tenants’ burden of proof as an
infringement of her privacy rights and how she was impacted.
 
12.  The photograph merely
displayed a living area of the rental
unit, exquisitely furnished
that did not in any way identify the owner of those furnishings.
 
13.  In her pleadings, the Tenant did not demonstrate how the listing
of the property for sale was a form of interference and
harassment.
 
14.  All in all, I was not satisfied
by the submissions that the Landlord harassed
or interferer with the
Tenant.
 
15.  A landlord has the right
to list and sell their property. In this instance
a notice to end the tenancy was not given by the
Landlord, the Tenant moved out of the rental unit after giving the Landlord
notice to end the tenancy.
 
16.  The invasion of privacy claim is
a matter dealt through another
judicial forum.
 
17.  The order contains
all the reasons for the decision within
the order. No other reasons
will be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Tenant and the Landlord
terminated May 1, 2020 the date the Tenant moved out of the rental unit.
 
2.     The Tenant’s application is dismissed.
