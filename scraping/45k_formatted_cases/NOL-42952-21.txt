Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-42952-21



In the matter
of:


65, 1 HEMLO DRIVE MARATHON ON P0T2E0


 




Between:


10732915 Canada Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
David Dubois Theresa Sabourin


 
Tenants



 
 
10732915 Canada Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Theresa Sabourin
and David Dubois
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 16, 2021. Only the Landlord's Agent, Pavel Lombart, attended
the hearing. As of 9:44 a.m. the Tenants were not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from March
1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective May 18,
2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $700.00.
 
4.    
The Tenants
paid $5,950.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord’s attempts at negotiating a repayment agreement were unsuccessful.
 
6.    
The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $700.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from February
1, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
 
8.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to




 
postpone the
eviction until January 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the
Act. Additional time given to the
Tenants to pay the outstanding amount.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated. The
Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before January 31, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$146.04*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January 6,
2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $23.01 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 7, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 31, 2022, the
Tenants will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from February 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022, then starting February
1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
February 1, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 31, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $1,586.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenants
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after February
1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants
are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
