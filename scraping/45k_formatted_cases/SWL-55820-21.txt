Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number: SWL-55820-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
1,
  745 KING STREET E KITCHENER ON N2G2M4


 




Between:


Ron Hallman


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Gary Mimeault


Tenant



 
 
 
Ron Hallman (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Gary Mimeault (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 27, 2022. The
Landlord, Ron Hallman, and the Tenant attended
the hearing. The Tenant
spoke with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
22, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,100.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
 
6.     The Tenant requests to postpone the eviction to
February 28, 2022 to pay the amount required
to void the order. I deny the Tenant’s request
because the Tenant has not made
any payments since the application was filed. The uncontradicted evidence of
the Landlord was that the parties have made payment arrangements in the past
which the Tenant has filed to comply with. The Tenant did not provide
sufficient evidence to prove that he could pay the amount required to void the
order. In my view, postponing the eviction would lead to further arrears and
prejudice to the Landlord.




 
7.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 15, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$5,677.22*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 4, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $36.16 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 5, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
15, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 16, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or
before February 15, 2022, then starting February
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession
of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 16, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 15, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $6,786.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction
will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated; and
the Tenant could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 16, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
