Order under Section
21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-91342-17-RV
 
 
Review Order
 
OSAI
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict CS
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
The Landlord’s representative, DR
and the Tenant attended the hearing on April 17, 2018. Only the Landlord’s
representative, DR, attended the hearing on May 29,
2018.
 
This
application was resolved by order TSL-91342-17 issued on June 6, 2018.
 
On June 10, 2018, the Tenant requested a review of the order.
 
A preliminary review of the review request was completed without a
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant requests a review of the voidable
order of eviction issued on June 6, 2018.  
2.     
The first hearing date of the Landlord’s
application on April 17, 2018 was adjourned because the Tenant left the
hearing.  Paragraph 3 of order TSL-91342-17 explains the circumstances of the
adjournment as follows:
At the hearing on April 17, 2018, the Tenant submitted that the
Landlord’s ledger is wrong but was unable to state which entry or entries were
wrong or how they were wrong. The Tenant then stated that she cannot tolerate a
hearing that is more than an hour long and said that she wished to call an
ambulance. The Tenant gave no specific reason for calling an ambulance. The
Tenant then called an ambulance, left the hearing room and the Board’s offices
by foot, then entered an ambulance that had attended to her call.
3.     
The hearing was then rescheduled to May 29, 2018
after the Tenant confirmed with Board staff that she was available on that
date. However, the Tenant did not attend on May 29, 2018 and the hearing
proceeded in her absence.
4.     
The request for review says that the Tenant was
unable to attend on May 29, 2018 because she was seen in the Emergency
Department of a local hospital on that day and she was therefore unable to
participate in the hearing.
5.     
On the basis of the submissions made in the
request, I am not satisfied that the Tenant was not reasonably able to
participate in the May 29, 2018 hearing date.
6.     
Order TSL-91342-17 sets out the history of the
proceedings, and the issue of whether the Board hearing should have been
adjourned on May 29, 2018, in the absence of the Tenant, was thoroughly
reviewed in the hearing order.  
7.     
The Member found that the Tenant took a number
of steps prior to the hearing date in order to avoid the hearing date, which
she had previously agreed to, and to further delay the proceeding by extending
the length of the adjournment.  
8.     
The medical evidence that the Tenant provided to
the Board with her requests to reschedule the May 29, 2018 hearing date were
found by the Member to be “vague”.  The order states: “The third request [to
reschedule], made on May 28, 2018, was denied because the doctor’s letter sent
in support of the request was vague as to (a) the reason the Tenant could not
participate in the hearing (it stated that she had ‘recent emotional trauma”),
(b) when the Tenant had experienced the trauma discussed in the letter, and (c)
when the Tenant would likely be able to participate in a hearing.  None of the
requests to reschedule mentioned any scheduling conflict with the hearing
date.”
9.     
The medical evidence that the Tenant has provided
to the Board with her request for review is a handwritten note on hospital
emergency note-paper to say “certify that MS visited this department as a
patient on May 10 and May 29th, 2018.  The note is illegibly
signed.  No other details are provided as to what times the visits occurred or
of what length they were, or what the purpose of the visit was.  I find the
note is not sufficient evidence of the Tenant’s inability to participate in the
hearing of May 29, 2018.
10.   The Board
takes seriously the right to participate as expressed in King-Winton v.
Doverhold Investments, 2008 CanLII 60708 para. 3 (ON SCDC), where the
Divisional Court stated: “Being reasonably able to participate in the
proceeding must be interpreted broadly, natural justice requires no less.” 
However, a party who fails to attend a hearing should not be in a better
position than the party who attends, and a party should not benefit from their
conduct in failing to attend a hearing by delaying the proceedings.  
 
11.   In addition, an interim order TSL-91342-17-IN was issued on April
19, 2018.  The interim order directed that the Tenant was to provide a) a list
of any issues the Tenant wishes to raise at the hearing pursuant to section 82
of the Act including particulars of her allegations and the remedies sought; b)
a list of any issues the Tenant wishes to raise at the hearing with respect to
the alleged arrears; and c) a copy of any additional evidence that the Tenant
intends to rely on at the hearing.  These items were to be provided to the Landlord
no later than May 3, 2018.  The Landlord reported to the hearing on May 29,
2018 that no submissions had been received from the Tenant on May 3, 2018 or at
all.
12.   Having considered the Tenant’s pattern of conduct aimed at delaying
the proceeding, her abuse of the Board’s process by failing to abide by the
interim order, and the vague and insufficient medical evidence provided by the
Tenant to support an adjournment on the grounds of medical need, the Member
determined that an adjournment of the May 29, 2018 hearing was not
appropriate.  I see no error in the Member’s decision to proceed with the
hearing in the circumstances. I accordingly exercise my discretion to deny the
request for review without a hearing, pursuant to Rule 29.11 of the Board’s
Rules of Practice.  
 
It is
ordered that:
1.     
The request to review order TSL-91342-17 issued
on June 6, 2018 is denied. The order is confirmed and remains unchanged.
