Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


 
File Number: EAL-98012-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
608,
  247 BATH ROAD KINGSTON ON K7M2X9


 




Between:


Homestead Land Holdings Limited


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Cheryl Rice


Tenant



 
 
Homestead Land Holdings Limited
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Cheryl
Rice (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 18, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Kimberly Adams attended the hearing. As of 10:56 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
February 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective April 10,
2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
As of January 1, 2022, the monthly
rent for the unit is
$735.23.
 
4.    
The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $760.03 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from July
1, 2021 to January 1, 2022.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the




File Number: EAL-98012-21
 
Tenant and find that it would
be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 6, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$7,860.11*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 26, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $24.17
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 27, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
6, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 7, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 6, 2022, then starting
February 7, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 7, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)   $8,912.95 if the payment is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)   $9,648.18 if the payment is made on or before
February 6, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 7, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
