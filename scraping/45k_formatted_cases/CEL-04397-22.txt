Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: CEL-04397-22



In the matter
of:


174 HICKORY STREET COLLINGWOOD ON L9Y3E8


 




Between:


Tanalex Corp


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Aurora
Lockyer Edward Logan


Tenants



 
On December 10,
2021, Tanalex Corp (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Edward Logan and Aurora Lockyer (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because
the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the
Board on May 3, 2021 with respect to application CEL-95909-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenants have not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenants failed to pay to the Landlord
$1,500.00 on or before December
1, 2021 towards rent.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order
required the Tenants
to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenants were
ordered to pay $15,186.00 for rent arrears in Order CEL-95909-20. The amount that is still owing from that order is $8,000.00 and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous order CEL-95909-20 is
cancelled.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,500.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from August
23, 2019 to January 17, 2022.
 
It
is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order CEL-95909-20 is cancelled.




File Number: CEL-04397-22
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 28, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$7,965.41*. This amount
represents the rent owing up to December 31, 2021
less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $49.32
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 1, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
28, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 29,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 29, 2022.
 
 
January 17, 2022

The tenant has until January 27, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 27, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.
 
In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on July 29, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction
where the rental unit is located.
