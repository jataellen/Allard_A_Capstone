Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-98289-21



In the
  matter of:


411, 107 COMPTON STREET KINGSTON ON K7K5Z5


 




Between:


Skyline Living


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Ashley Hoogenraad
  Kaiden Vanderform


 
Tenants



 
 
Skyline Living (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kaiden Vanderform and
Ashley Hoogenraad (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe. The Landlord
also claimed administration charges related to NSF cheques.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 1, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord's Agent,
Adelina Andreita, attended
the hearing. As of 10:49 a.m., the Tenants
were not present or represented at the hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to November
30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October 6, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on November
15, 2021. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
3.    
The lawful monthly rent was $1,255.10.
4.    
The Tenants have made no payments
since the application was filed.
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,255.10 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     The NSF charges claimed by the Landlord related to
preauthorized withdrawals or automatic debiting rather than NSF cheques. Since subsection 87(5) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006, does not provide a remedy for a preauthorized
withdrawal or automatic debit that fails due to non-sufficient funds, the
Landlord’s claim for NSF charges is denied.
