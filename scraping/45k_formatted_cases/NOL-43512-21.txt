Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-43512-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


UNIT 1, 2795
KINGSWAY BOULEVARD SUDBURY
  ON P3B2G3


 




Between:


Michael Saucier


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Francine Robitaille
  Matthew Crandall


Tenants



 
 
 
Michael Saucier (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Francine Robitaille and Matthew Crandall
(the 'Tenants') because
the unit was given to the Tenants
for the term of their
employment which has now ended.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 22, 2021.
The Landlord’s agent D. Swyer and the Tenants attended the hearing. Determinations:
1.    
The Landlord served the Tenants
with a Form N8 pursuant to paragraph 58(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the “Act”), seeking an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants on the basis the
rental unit was given to the Tenants for the
term of their employment which has now ended.
 
2.     The Tenants moved into the rental unit on March 1,
2019.     The Tenants are still in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The Landlord’s agent advised that the Tenant’s
employment was terminated on July 30, 2021, and that the residence was
conditional upon the Tenant’s employment.
 
4.    
Monthly rent was $1200.00.
 
5.    
The Tenant Matthew Crandall
testified that he worked for the Landlord’s restoration company for approximately one year prior to moving
into the rental
unit on March 1, 2019. Mr. Crandall also stated that at no
time was the rental unit made conditional upon his employment with the Landlord
or the Landlord’s company.
 
6.     The Tenant Francine
Robitaille has never worked for the Landlord




File Number: NOL-43512-21
 
 
 
7.    
The Tenants produced a copy of the lease agreement
dated March 1, 2019 (the “Lease”), showing both Francine
Robitaille and Matthew Crandall as Tenants. The
Lease also makes no reference that
the rental unit is conditional upon the Mr. Crandall’s employment
with the Landlord. The only reference
to Mr. Crandall’s employment is a handwritten notation upon the typed lease
that says “$75.00 to be deducted from my pay weekly for rent”.
 
8.    
The onus of proof in this case
rests with the Landlord and I find the Landlord has not proven on a balance of
probabilities that the Tenant’s unit was made available to the Tenants as a
condition of the Tenant’s employment.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
