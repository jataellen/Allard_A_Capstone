Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24755-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


UNIT. 303,
600 IRELAND ROAD SIMCOE ON N3Y4K2


 




Between:


Cary Vervaeke


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kyle Weatherston


Tenant



 
 
 
Cary Vervaeke (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kyle Weatherston (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's
rent. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard by
video conference on January 5,
2022.
 
Only the Landlord’s legal
representative, J. Cayford,
attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant did not attend
the hearing scheduled for 9 a.m. I waited
over 90 minutes, and then I proceeded to hear the
matter on an uncontested basis.
 
2.    
The Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
3.     The Landlord’s legal representative said that the Landlord attempted to mediate with the
Tenant when he first fell behind in August, 2021. She said that there was correspondence to the Tenant about
making extra payments on top of the rent, but the Landlord did not receive a
response.
 
4.     The Landlord’s legal
representative said that the Tenant did not attend a hearing for the
Landlord’s L1 application, held on December 14, 2021. That file concluded with a standard termination order, issued on
January 5, 2022. The Tenant owes
$5,100.00 in arrears to the end of January, 2022.
 
5.     The Landlord’s legal
representative said that the Tenant has not made any rent payments at all since July, 2021. The Landlord now requests termination.




 
 
 
6.    
I
find that the Tenant has been persistently late paying the rent, and since July, 2021, he has not paid any rent at all. I find that the Landlord has proved, on a
balance of probabilities that the tenancy is no longer viable. The arrears are substantial, and they are
accruing further each month. The
Tenant has not responded to the Landlord’s attempts to negotiate the arrears
and the late payments.
 
7.     Based on the uncontested evidence of the Landlord, I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances above in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
and find that it would
be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
January 29, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 29, 2022.
 
2.    
If the Tenant fails to vacate the rental unit on
or before January 29, 2022, the Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$27.95 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
from January 30, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before January
29, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 30, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 29, 2022, then starting
January 30, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 30, 2022.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
