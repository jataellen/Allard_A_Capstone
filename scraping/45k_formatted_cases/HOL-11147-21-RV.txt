Review Order
 
 
Cx Financial Investing Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Nafi Caroline Toure (aka
Caroline-nafi Toure) (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also
applied for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the
damage; and because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered
with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit
after the termination date.
 
This application was resolved by order HOL-11147-21 issued on October
15, 2021. On December 3,
2021, the Board initiated a review of the order.
The review was heard by videoconference on January 7, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s representative, C. Cheung, and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     Based on the type of application filed
by the Landlord, the Board
did not have jurisdiction
to issue a voidable order.
 
2.     The Landlord failed
to establish that the Tenant did not the void notice of termination by repeating the conduct alleged
in the notice during the voiding period.
The failure to pay
the Landlord’s legal fees does not constitute renting the unit through Airbnb
during the voiding period.




File Number: HOL-11147-21
 
3.    
In any event, the Tenant subsequently paid the legal fees therefore eviction is not warranted.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     Order HOL-11147-21 issued
on October 15, 2021 is cancelled and the application filed by the
Landlord is dismissed.
