Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-36556-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


806, 271 RIDLEY BOULEVARD TORONTO ON M5M4N1


 




Between:


Sergiu Lazarovici


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Verne D'Angelo


Tenant



 
 
 
Sergiu Lazarovici (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Verne
D'Angelo (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant entered
into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord and the Tenant signed an agreement to terminate the tenancy as of April 30, 2022.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before April 30, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before April 30, 2022, then starting May 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after May 1, 2022.
