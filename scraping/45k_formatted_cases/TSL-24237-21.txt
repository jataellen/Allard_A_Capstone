the hearing. The Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.

the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from May 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because

terminated as of December 15, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant possession
of the rental unit to the Landlord.
