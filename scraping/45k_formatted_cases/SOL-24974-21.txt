In the
  matter of:


2, 131 MARKLAND STREET HAMILTON ON L8P2K3


 




Between:


Cornerstone Select
Properties


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Michelle Lowry
  Rob Lee


Tenants



 
 
 
Cornerstone Select Properties (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Michelle Lowry and Rob Lee (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 18, 2022. Only the Landlord's Agent, Violeta Kocalev, attended the hearing. As of 9:37 a.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      
The Tenants were in possession of the rental
unit on the date the application was filed.
 
2.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,795.00.
 
4.    
The Tenants paid $8,346.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.     The only part of the application that proceeded was the claim for rent arrears. As a result, the order will be limited to rent
arrears and costs only, not eviction.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlord $629.00, which represents the amount of rent
owing up to January 31, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.




File Number: SOL-24974-21
 
3.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or
before January 31, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 1,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
