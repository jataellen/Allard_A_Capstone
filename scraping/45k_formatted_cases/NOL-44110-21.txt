Three Seasons Investments Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order

because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 13, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Anna Vilano, attended
the hearing. As of 3 p.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
18, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
November 30, 2021. The Tenant
was in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,217.00.
 
4.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,170.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 1, 2018 to September 18, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenant
has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of November
30, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.

Landlord $2,422.35*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to November
30, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February

2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
