In the
  matter of:


21, 368 ZEPHYR
AVENUE OTTAWA ON K2B6A1


 




Between:


Interrent C/O CLV
Group


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Mark
  Zeleny


Tenant



 
 
Interrent C/O
CLV Group (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Mark Zeleny (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another
tenant; and has seriously
impaired the safety of any person in the residential complex.
 
The Landlord
has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for damage to the rental unit and
residential complex pursuant to section 89 of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the ‘Act’).
 
The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 6,
2021.
 
Only the
Landlord, represented by D. Abraham, and the Landlord’s witness, D. Quinn
(‘DQ’) attended the hearing.
The Tenant was not present
or represented as of 12:17pm
despite being served with the
notice of hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant
is in possession of the rental unit.
 
2.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,099.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
3.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from May 23, 2019 to
July 29, 2021
 
4.    
The rental
property is described
as 3 levels with a basement and 2 levels
on top that sits about 50-60
feet from the road.




 
5.    
DQ testified that he is the property manager for the Landlord and part of his role includes receiving and investigating complaints regarding other Tenants
in the residential complex
and scheduling and managing maintenance at the property.
 
6.    
Much of the Landlord’s
evidence consisted of hearsay evidence. While
the Board may admit hearsay, it must be mindful of the inherent dangers in
doing so, particularly given that hearsay evidence can be unreliable. In my view, admitting the evidence will
not result in any procedural fairness
against the Tenant,
who did not attend the hearing. As a
result, I will admit the hearsay, and consider its reliability as a question of
what weight to give it.
 
N5 Notices - Substantial interference
 
7.    
On March 18, 2021, the
Landlord served the Tenant with a Notice to End your Tenancy for substantial
interference (‘N5 Notice’) alleging that on February 11, 2021 a neighbouring
tenant complained that the Tenant’s occupant, Zaranika Tanefi (‘ZT’) was
screaming obscenities from the open unit window
to the parking lot below,
while waiving her middle
finger and yelling “your bitch is dead”.
 
8.    
The N5 Notice further
states that on February 25, 2021 the Landlord received another complaint
regarding ZT screaming obscenities to another Tenant which consisted of,
“Fucking bitch. Fucking
leave the country.
Get out of the fucking
building, fucking whore”.
 
9.    
Subsection 64(3) of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) states that a tenant can
void an N5 Notice by stopping the activities or correcting the described
behaviour within seven days of being served with notice. In this case,
the seven-day voiding
period began on March 18, 2021 and ended on March 24, 2021.
 
10.  It was the evidence of the Landlord
that no complaints were received during the voiding period. Accordingly, the Tenant successfully voided the first N5 Notice.
 
11.  Pursuant to section 68(1) of the Act,
however, the Landlord served the Tenant with a second N5 Notice on July 19,
2021. The second N5 Notice indicates
that at approximately 3:30pm on March 28, 2021, ZT was witnessed angrily kicking vehicles
in the parking lot of the complex and ZT called another Tenant a,
“bitch” and a “whore”. Then at approximately 11:00pm the same day, both the Tenant
and ZT were witnessed
engaging in a loud disruptive argument at the front of the complex that
disturbed other Tenants in the complex.
 
12.  DQ testified that he received
complaints from other Tenants regarding these incidents.
 
13.  The N5 also alleges that on April 27, 2021
at approximately 12:00pm DQ witnessed the Tenant and ZT screaming obscenities
at each other on the common grounds of the complex. DQ testified that he could hear the screaming from 3 buildings
down from where they were arguing outside and he
also received complaints from other Tenants regarding the incident. ZT was
screaming, “you and your bitches, fuck you” and using what DQ described as,
“other colourful language”.




 
14.  Based on the uncontested evidence of DQ I
find that the Tenant and their occupant have substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment of other Tenants in the residential complex and that by doing so, the Tenant
and their occupant
have substantially interfered with the Landlord’s lawful
right, privilege and interest.
 
N7 Notice – Serious Impairment of Safety
 
15.  On May 26, 2021 DQ received a complaint that ZT had verbally assaulted a Tenant in front of the residential complex while
physically assaulting her with a cooler bag.
 
16.  Submitted
into evidence was a handwritten letter from the victim tenant
which indicated that both the Tenant and ZT were present when ZT took a cooler
bag out of her wagon and proceeded to attack her with it
while calling her a “bitch” and threatening her. This incident happened out front of the
complex on the walkway leading to the entry of the building. The letter goes on to indicate that she is afraid of ZT and has called the police on the Tenant and ZT, but that the
police have not successfully intervened. The victim tenant indicates that they
are afraid to do laundry and get their mail as a result of the continued
harassing and threatening behaviour of the Tenant and ZT.
 
17. 
In Furr
v. Courtland Mews Cooperative Housing
Inc., 2020 ONSC 1175, the Divisional
Court reaffirmed that serious
impairment includes not only actual
impairment, but also circumstances involving a real risk
of impairment, including the following:
 
(i)   the potential for an outcome
that has the risk of a substantial negative effect on a
person’s well-being;
 
(ii)     a foreseeable act or omission
that could result in or may result
in a serious impairment to safety; and
 
(iii)     extremely
loud and intense
arguments could easily
result in violence
and would be a
safety hazard.
 
18.  I have decided
to admit the hearsay letter
of the victim tenant. While I have accorded less weight to it than I would had the
tenant attended to testify in-person, it remains uncontested and I accept, on a balance of probabilities, that the
incident with the cooler bag on May 26, 2021 which included a verbal assault,
seriously impaired the safety of a person in the residential complex.
 
Damages pursuant to subsection 89 of the Act
 
19.  DQ testified that around July 3, 2021 the
Tenant disposed of an interior door in the unit owned by the Landlord. The Landlord replaced
the door at a cost of $70.00
inclusive of labour and is
requesting that the Tenant be ordered to pay for the door.
 
20.  DQ testified that around July 13, 2021 the Tenant
admitted to removing
the door and that
they had removed the stove from their unit. DQ
indicated that the Tenant put the stove




 
outside and someone else picked it up. DQ testified that the stove replacement was between $350-$450 and the Landlord
requests the costs of the replacement.
 
21.  Although
the removal of an item from the rental unit may not be considered damage in its ordinary sense, I find that the loss
of the items, which is a result of the Tenant removing the items without
replacing them, can be considered damage to the unit within the meaning of the
Act.
 
22.  I am satisfied, on a balance
of probabilities, that the Tenant
has caused undue damage to the rental unit by damaging the door
and by removing the stove from the rental unit. I further accept that the
Landlord incurred costs to replace those items. I find that the Landlord is
entitled to the reasonable costs to replace the door in the amount of $70.00
and I will further order that the Tenant pay the reasonable cost to replace the
stove in the amount of $350.00 for a total of $420.00.
 
Section 83 considerations – Relief from Eviction
 
23.  DQ testified that on August
17, 2021 he received an email from the Tenant indicating that he caused damage in the stairwell of
the residential complex.
 
24.  Submitted
into evidence was a series
of photographs in the stairwell
of the building. DQ testified
that there are 7 or 8 walls damaged with holes that look like someone took a
hammer to the walls. The Tenant did
attempt to repair the damage, but the repairs are poorly done and will need to
be redone by the Landlord.
 
25.  DQ indicated that the conduct of the Tenant
and their occupant have persisted despite the
notices of termination. DQ testified that other Tenants in the complex have told him that they are afraid to have their children play
outside in the complex for fear that the Tenant and their occupant
will subject them to foul language and aggressive behaviour.
 
26.  DQ testified that on September 7, 2021 he
received a complaint that ZT verbally assaulted another tenant when they were
trying to leave for work. ZT was blocking their vehicle from leaving. DQ received further
complaints the same day regarding ZT kicking and
damaging vehicles in the parking lot. Although no pictures were submitted into
evidence of the damage, I accept the oral testimony of DQ that he received these
complaints and believed them to be true.
 
27.  DQ further testified
that he has issues with showing available
units to prospective tenants because ZT opens their unit windows and sticks her
middle finger up at them and accuses them of being spies.
 
28.  I find that the Tenant and their occupant have continued to substantially interfere with other Tenants and the Landlord despite being served with notice to stop the conduct.
 
29.  The claim
for damages to the rental
unit and residential complex does not form part of my decision regarding grounds for
termination of the tenancy, However, I will consider the




 
uncontested hearsay
evidence of DQ as persuasive in my reasoning to not grant discretionary relief pursuant to 83
of the Act.
 
30. 
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated, as of January
17, 2022. The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before January 17, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$470.00, which represents the reasonable costs of
replacing the damaged items.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $4,821.20, which represents compensation for the use of the unit
from July 30, 2021 to January 6, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord
owes on the rent deposit
and less any amounts already
paid to the Landlord
by the Tenant.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$36.93 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from January 7, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
6.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
January 11, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from January 12, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
7.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January
18, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord
on or after January 18, 2022. The Sheriff is requested to expedite the enforcement
of this order.
