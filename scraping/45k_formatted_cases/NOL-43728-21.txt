Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: NOL-43728-21
 



In the matter
of:


1,
  316 ERIE STREET SUDBURY ON P3C3V3


 




Between:


Andre Gareau Nathalie Gareau Anthony Farrugia


Landlords




 


and


 




 


Laura Gladu


Tenant



 
Andre Gareau, Nathalie Gareau
and Anthony Farrugia
(the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Laura Gladu (the 'Tenant') because they intend to do
major repairs or renovations to the rental unit.
The Landlords also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard via video/teleconference on December 13, 2021.
 
Only the Landlords and the Landlord's Legal Representative Monique
Laderoute attended the hearing.
 
As of 4:15 p.m., the Tenants
were not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     On June 30, 2021,
the Landlord served
a N13 a Notice to End the Tenancy.
The termination date in the notice was October 31, 2021.
 
2.     The N13 was served pursuant
to section 50 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (Act) with states:
50 (1) A landlord
may give notice of termination of a tenancy
if the landlord requires possession of the rental unit in order to,
 
(a) 
demolish it;
(b)  convert it to use for a purpose other than residential premises; or
(c) 
do repairs or renovations to it that are
so extensive that they require
a building permit and vacant possession of the rental
unit.




 
(2) The date for termination
specified in the notice shall be at least 120 days after the notice is given and shall be the day a
period of the tenancy ends or, where the tenancy
is for a fixed term, the end of the term.
 
3.     I find that the Landlords provided evidence to support
their claim that they genuinely intend to renovate
the rental unit that entail
significant reconfiguration of each units
and effectively demolish the unit.
 
4.     Based on the uncontested documentary evidence
submitted by the Landlords, I am satisfied that the Landlord has obtained and/or
has taken steps to obtain the necessary permits for this work.
 
5.     The Tenants did not attend
the hearing to make submissions.
 
6.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
7.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,500.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords and shall be applied to the last
month of the tenancy.
 
8.    
The order contains all the reasons
for the decision
within the order.
No other reasons
will be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
January 31, 2022. The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before January 31, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords
$49.32 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from February 1, 2022 to
the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
3.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022, then starting
February 1, 2022, the
Landlords may file this
order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
4.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after February 1, 2022.
