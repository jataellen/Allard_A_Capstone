IMH Pool IV LP (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict John C
Seguin (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 1, 2021. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Sara Mathew, attended the hearing.
As of 9:51 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period
from March 1, 2020 to October 31, 2021.
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective April 11, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on
October 22, 2021. The Tenant was in possession
of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,857.34.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,857.34 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     The Tenant paid $5,691.03 after the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of
October 22, 2021, the date the Tenant
gave vacant possession of the
rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the
Landlord $4,665.59*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to October 22, 2021, less the rent deposit.

for the cost of filing
the application.

the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
