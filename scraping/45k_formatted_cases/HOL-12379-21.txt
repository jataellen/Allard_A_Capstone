the tenancy as of September 30, 2021 and the Tenant did not move out of the rental
unit by the termination

the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 31, 2022.

$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
January 31, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
February 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022, then starting February
1, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
