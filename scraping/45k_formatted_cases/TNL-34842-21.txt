Gabriel Hector Stephanie Izeard-Harper


Tenants



 
 
Terrace Woods (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Stephanie Izeard-Harper and Gabriel Hector
(the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 10, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Joey Kay, attended the hearing. As of 2:55 p.m.,
the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 17, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,230.76
as of January 31, 2022.
 
4.    
The Tenants
paid all arrears
for the period
ending January 31, 2022 after the application
was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,147.43
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
The only amount outstanding is part of the Landlord's cost of filing
the application. As a
result, the order will be limited to costs only and not eviction.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$173.14 for the cost of filing the application.

If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February

at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
