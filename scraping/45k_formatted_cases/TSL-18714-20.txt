TSL-17721-20 L2
Mary-louise Taselos
and Photini Taselos
(the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict John Barnett and Elijah Barnett (the 'Tenants')
 
This application was heard via videoconference on November 19, 2021.
 
The Landlords Legal Representative David
Ciobotaru, the Landlords, and the Tenants
attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
At the outset of the hearing,
the Landlords representative confirmed that the Tenants had vacated the rental unit as of
November 21, 2020.
 
2.    
The parties
could not agree if the application fees for both application should be paid.
 
3.    
The file TSL-17721-20 the 2nd N5 was defective and I note that the application was filed
same day that the 2nd N5 was served.
 
4.    
The file TSL-18714-20, contains
a 3rd N5 with different
allegations. I note that in this
instance the application was filed the same day the 3rd N5 was served.

5.    
The Tenants
stated that the filings are excessive, could
have been combined,
however they feel the Landlord intended to bring them before the Board. In addition, their only income is from
ODSP and is therefore restrictive.
 
6.    
I have considered all of the circumstances, including
that there remains
an L1 application and a Tenant T2/T6 application to be resolved
between the parties, and note that the Landlord’s notices may have been
defective had the applications proceeded, and therefore given the possibility
of mixed results on these applications, I am declining to order the application
fee to be paid.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlords' applications are dismissed.
