Order under Section 87(1)
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-53899-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


1808 WESTCOTT ROAD WINDSOR ON N8W4K2


 




Between:


Marda Management Inc


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Rachel Dufour


Tenant



 
Marda Management Inc (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Rachel Dufour (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 27, 2022. As of 1:33 p.m., the Tenant
was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board. The Landlord’s Agent, Kira Passell
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant paid the Landlord for the period ending
January 31, 2022. The amount paid
represents all the rent that was in arrears under the tenancy agreement and any
additional rent that would have been due under the tenancy agreement on the date of the Tenant's payment. The only amount outstanding is the
Landlord’s cost of filing the application. As
a result, the order will be limited to costs only and not eviction.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
2.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
February 21, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
