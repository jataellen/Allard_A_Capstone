Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-13693-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


MAIN FLOOR, 28 GRASSMERE COURT OSHAWA ON L1H3X4


 




Between:


Kingsbury Properties Inc. C/o


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Harold Rosborough


Tenant



 
 
Kingsbury
Properties Inc. C/o (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Harold
Rosborough (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on June 9, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s Representative, Curtis Begg, and the Tenant attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period from February
1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination
effective October 22, 2020.
 
2.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,800.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
3.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from October 22, 2019 to October 22, 2020.
 
4.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
the Act. The Tenant admits owing the amount of arrears claimed by the Landlord.
The Tenant testified that he lost his employment and experienced delays in
receiving his government subsidies, which caused him to be late in paying his
rent. The Tenant proposed a payment arrangement that was rejected by the Landlord,
because it would take 120 months to clear the arrears,
which is unreasonable. This tenancy is not viable, because the Tenant is unable
to pay the rent or make reasonable payment towards the arrears. The Landlord is
experiencing hardship because of the Tenant’s inability to pay the rent. I see
no reason to deny the eviction
requested by the Lanldord.




 
5.    
The applicant wanted to raise
various repair issues under s. 82 at the hearing, but these issues could not be considered, because
they were not brough to the Landlord’s attention prior. As well, to raise section 82 issues at the
hearing, the applicant should have disclosed them to the Landlord prior to the
hearing. No evidence regarding any repair issues were submitted prior to the
hearing and the Landlord was never notified that the Tenant would be raising
these issues at the hearing. Therefore, these repair issues must be raised in a
separate Tenant application.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 16, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $33,101.30*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 5, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $59.18
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 6, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
16, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 16, 2022, then starting
January 17, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 17, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before January 16, 2022, the Tenant pays the
amount of $36,586.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction
will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and
the Tenant could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
17, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
