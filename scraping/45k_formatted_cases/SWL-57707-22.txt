Between:

Deive Holdings Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Ashley Brett-Carillo Jonathan Brett-Carillo


Tenants



 
 
 
81 Eagan Deive Holdings
Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Jonathan Brett-Carillo and Ashley Brett-Carillo (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because
the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the
Board on October 21, 2021 with respect to application SWL48521-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants
have not met the following
condition specified in the order: The
Tenants failed to pay the lawful monthly rent in full, on or before February 1,
2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants were ordered to pay
$186.00 for and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order SWL48521-21. The amount that is still
owing from that order is
$186.00 and that amount
is included in this order.
As a result, the previous
order SWL48521-21 is cancelled.
 
4.     Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from February 1, 2022 to February 28, 2022.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,425.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from January 1, 2018 to
February 23, 2022.




File Number: SWL-57707-22
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order SWL48521-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before March 6, 2022.
 
3.     As of the date of this order, the Tenants owe no money
to the Landlord because the amount of the rent deposit
and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit
exceeds the that the Landlord is entitled to under this order by
$165.49.
 
4.     The Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenants:
$50.33 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 24,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.     The Landlord or the Tenants
shall pay any amounts that become owing
as a result of this order.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 6, 2022, then starting
March 7, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 7, 2022.

The tenant has until March 5, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under s. 78(9) of the Act. If
the tenant files the motion by March 5, 2022 the order will be stayed and the
Board will schedule a hearing.
