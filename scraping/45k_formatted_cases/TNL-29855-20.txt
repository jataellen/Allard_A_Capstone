Rajandra Persaud (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Darby Mayaemba Lukombo (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 6,
2021.
 
Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Denise
Boyce, attended the hearing.
As of 10:14 a.m., the
Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
March 1, 2020 to October 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October
10, 2020.
 
2.     The Tenant vacate
the rental unit on September 30, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,160.00.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as September 30, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$19,131.07*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to September 30, 2021.

3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before October
11, 2021, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from October 12, 2021 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
