In the matter
of:


403, 807 KENNEDY ROAD SCARBOROUGH ON M1K2E2

Tenants




 


 
and


 




 


Mpc Properties


Landlord



 
 
 
Andre
Seivwright and Mauva Allen (the 'Tenants') applied for an order determining
that Mpc Properties (the 'Landlord') altered the locking system on a door
giving entry to the rental unit or residential complex without giving them
replacement keys and substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of
the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenants or by a member of their
household.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 2, 2021.
Only the Tenants attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants live in a 5-floor building, consisting of
approximately 7 units per floor. The
Tenants alleged that commencing in August 2020, the tenants above the Tenants’
unit consistently made loud noise from the early morning (7:00am) to the late
evening (12:00am). The Tenant Andrew
Seivwright advises there was daily knocking and banging.
 
2.    
The Tenant Andrew Seivwright
states he brought this issue to the Landlord’s attention numerous times from
August 2020 onwards. The Landlord’s
response was that he should call the
police and that the Landlord would talk to the tenants.  Mr Seivwright states the knocking and banging failed to stop
and on January 5 2021, the loud vibration caused a picture and trophy to fall
and break.
 
3.    
I find that the loud
banging/knocking on the Tenant’s ceiling constitutes substantial inference with their reasonable enjoyment of the unit, and that
this interference resulted in damage to the Tenants’ items.
The Tenants seek $500 from the Landlord for the costs to repair/replace the picture frame and trophy.
The Tenants did not produce
receipts or




 
estimates for the costs to
repair. I find $125 to be a
reasonable cost to repair the picture frame and trophy.
 
4.     The Tenants also alleged that the Landlord changed the
locks, thus excluding them from access to the garage area in order to put out
the garbage. According to Mr Seivwright, he must now walk outside, down/up the hill of the driveway,
instead of going through the basement.
 
5.    
Section 24 of the Act
is the applicable section and provides as follows:
 
A landlord shall not alter the locking system
on a door giving entry to a rental unit or
residential complex or cause the locking system to be altered during the
tenant’s occupancy of the rental unit without giving the tenant replacement
keys
 
6.     The allegation alleges the Tenants’ access to the
garage area is restricted, not the entry to the residential complex. Accordingly, I do not find that the
Landlord breached section 24 of the Act as the Landlord did not alter the
locking system of a door giving entry to the residential complex.
This portion of the Tenants’ application is dismissed.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord shall pay to the
Tenants $125.00. This represents the
reasonable costs that the Tenants will incur in repairing/replacing property
that was damaged as a result of the Landlord's failure to address the
banging/knocking disturbance caused to the Tenants’
unit.
 
2.    
The Landlord will pay the filing fee to the Tenants in the amount
of $48.00.
 
3.    
The Landlord shall pay the Tenants
the full amount
owing by February
13, 2022.
 
4.     If the Landlord
does not pay the Tenants
the full amount
owing by February 13, 2022
the Landlord will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 14, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the outstanding
balance.
 
5.    
The Tenants have the right, at any time, to collect
the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
