Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-34895-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


BASEMENT 1, 517 LYNETT
CRESCENT RICHMOND HILL ON L4C2V8


 




Between:


Hexiang Lu


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Haddi Alami


Tenant



 
 
 
Hexiang Lu (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Haddi Alami
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by way of video conference on January 17, 2022. Only the Landlord’s legal representative Jenny
Xizhen Chai attended the hearing. As
of 11:13am the Tenant was not
present despite being served with notice of hearing from the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay
for the period from August 11,
2019 to February 10, 2022. Because of
the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 12,
2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $840.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
3.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 11, 2019 to August 12, 2021.
 
4.     The Tenant paid $500.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including the impact
of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1)
of the Act.

It is ordered that:
 
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of
the rental unit on or before
March 1, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $21,918.62*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
18, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $26.99
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 19, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before March 1, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 2, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 1, 2022, then starting
March 2, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 2, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before March 1, 2022,
the Tenant pays the amount of $24,272.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that
the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on
time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after March
2, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
