Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55984-21
 



In the
  matter of:


305, 1426 HURON
STREET LONDON ON N5V2E5


 




Between:


Skyline Living


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Rishabh Bhalla


Tenant



 
Skyline Living (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Rishabh Bhalla (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed administration
charges related to NSF cheques.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 27, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Candise Moore, attended the hearing. As of 10:38 a.m.,
the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although properly
served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective October 8, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $893.61.
 
4.     The Landlord incurred
charges of $40.00
for administration charges
related to cheques tendered by or on behalf of the
Tenant, which were returned NSF.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $897.15
from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from May 1, 2021 to
October 8, 2021.
 
7.    
The Tenant paid $2,987.22 after the application was filed.
 
8.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on
the parties and whether the Landlords attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would
not be unfair to postpone
the eviction until February 28, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.
 
2.     As of the date of this order,
the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the
arrears of rent, compensation, and any unpaid charges related to NSF cheques the Landlord is entitled to by $120.81*.
 
3.    
However, the Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount the
Landlord owes the Tenant:
$29.38 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
February 5, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit,
and
$186.00 for
the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     The Landlord or the Tenant
shall pay to the other
any sum of money that is owed as a
result of this order.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
7.     If, on or before February 28, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $1,699.54** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this
order for eviction will be void. This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if the Tenant pays the amount
required under that subsection on or after March 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make
this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
