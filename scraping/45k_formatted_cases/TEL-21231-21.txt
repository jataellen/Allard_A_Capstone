1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice

the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order: The Tenant did not replace
the patio stones in the backyard by October 21, 2021 as per
the instructions in the Order dated September 21, 2021.

ordered that:

2.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 18, 2022.
