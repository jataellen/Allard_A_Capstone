In the
  matter of:


601, 265 ENFIELD
PLACE STREET NORTH MISSISSAUGA ON L5B3Y7


 




Between:


Enrique Jairzinho Mendez Ravelo


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Yanet Cabrera De Lukacko


Tenant



 
 
Enrique Jairzinho Mendez Ravelo
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy of Yanet Cabrera De Lukacko (the
'Tenant'),and evict the unauthorized occupant.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on February
24, 2022. The Landlord,
represented by Nicole Fazzari, the Tenant and the unauthorized occupant Mark
Lukacko, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant acknowledges she no longer
resides in the rental unit.
 
2.     Mark Lukacko acknowledges he has been living in the rental
unit since the Tenant
vacated.
 
3.    
Rent has not been paid Since
May 2020. The amount of rent that has not been paid is
$43,120.00.
 
4.     The Tenant transferred the occupancy of the rental
unit to Mark Lukacko
(hereinafter called the 'Unauthorized Occupant') in a manner that was not
authorized by the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'). The Landlord
did not enter into a tenancy
agreement with this person.
 
5.     The Unauthorized Occupant
was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
6.     The Landlord is entitled to compensation for the use and occupation of the rental unit by the Unauthorized Occupant.
 
7.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.

8.    
Considering the fact the Landlord has been waiting
since April 2021 when this application
was filed with the Board for a hearing, and the fact that the amount of rent
that has not been paid, I find it fair to grant the Landlord’s request to
expedite the enforcement of this order.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated as of March 5, 2022.
 
2.     The Unauthorized Occupant
shall move out of the rental unit on or before March
5, 2022.
 
3.     The Unauthorized Occupant shall pay to the Landlord
$35,000.00, which represents the Board’s monetary jurisdiction as compensation for the use of the unit from May 1, 2020 to February 28, 2022.
 
4.     If the unit is not vacated by March 5, 2022, then starting March
6, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (the Sheriff), so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
5.    
Upon receipt of this order, the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) requested to expedite the enforcement of this order and is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord after March 6, 2022.
