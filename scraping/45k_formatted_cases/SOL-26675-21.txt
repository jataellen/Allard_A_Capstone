Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26675-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


458 KING WILLIAM STREET HAMILTON ON L8L1P9


 




Between:


Sajini Markreiter


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Frank Zygmunt Jaqueline Boucher


Tenants



 
 
 
Sajini Markreiter (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Frank
Zygmunt and Jaqueline Boucher (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have
the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on August 10,
2021 with respect to application SOL-20842-21. (L4 application)
 
This L4 application was sent to a hearing
and the hearing was held by videoconference on January 21, 2022. Both
parties were sent a Notice of Hearing for this L4 hearing.
 
Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Andrew
Choubeta, attended the hearing. As of 2:59 pm, the Tenants were not present or
represented. The hearing commenced at
that time.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
The Landlord filed the L4
application on December 2, 2021, which set out the Tenants’ payments and
breaches up to December 2, 2021. The
Landlord’s Legal Representative went over the relevant payment and breach
information during the hearing, and I reviewed
the submissions in further detail
after the hearing,
so that I may issue
this order.
 
3.    
In the L4 application, the Landlord submitted the Tenants made three payments
in August 2021, totalling
$3,540.00. The previous order only
required the Tenants to pay the monthly rent in August 2021. This means that $1,400.00 is to be
credited against the arrears. In
effect, the Tenants pre-paid the $1,400.00 arrears scheduled in the previous
order for the three months of September 30, 2021, October 31, 2021 and November
30,
2021.




 
4.    
In September 2021, the Tenants
made two payments totalling $2,440.00. This
is therefore split between $2,140.00 towards
September 2021 rent and
$300.00 credited against the arrears owing. In effect,
this $300.00 is to be credited against the $600.00
arrears amount that was scheduled to be paid in December
2021, that is by December 31st.
 
5.     In October 2021,
the Tenants made one payment
of $1,900.00 on October 30th. This is credited toward the rent that was due
on October 31, 2021, but is short $240.00 for the rent in October 2021. There is no money to be credited to the
arrears amount owing.
 
6.     In November 2021, the Tenants
made one payment
of $740.00 on November 2nd. This is credited toward the rent that was due
on November 30, 2021, but is short $1,400.00 for the rent in November 2021. There is no money to be credited to the
arrears amount owing.
 
7.    
The Landlord’s Legal Representative confirmed that after the November
2, 2021 payment, there have
been no further payments made by the Tenants.
 
8.     Consequently, as of the filing
date for the L4 application, I find that the Tenants
have not met the following
conditions specified in the August 10, 2021 order:
 
•        
The Tenants did not pay the
Landlord the monthly rents for October 2021 and November 2021, which were due on the last day
of each corresponding month.
 
9.    
As of the date of this hearing, I find that the Tenants have also
not met the following
conditions specified in the previous August 10, 2021 order:
 
•        
The Tenants did not pay the monthly rent due for December 2021 which was due
on the last day of December; and
•        
The Tenants did not pay the $600.00 arrears
payments due on or before
December 31, 2021.
 
10.  I note that under the August 10, 2021 order, the rent
for January 2022 and the $600.00 arrears payment in January 2022 are not
scheduled to be paid until January 31st. As
a result, the January 2022 rent does not form part of the rent arrears calculation hereunder but it is included under the daily compensation owing from January
1, 2022 onwards. As the arrears
payment for January 2022 is not yet due, I do not find a breach has yet
happened in respect of an arrears payment in January 2022.
 
11.  The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent.
Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to
request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
12.  The Tenants were ordered to pay $12,105.00 for rent
arrears in Order SOL-20842-21. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $10,405.00 and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous order SOL-20842-21 is
cancelled.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SOL-20842-21 issued
on August 10, 2021
is cancelled and is replaced
by the following order.
 
2.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 5, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$14,185.00*. This amount
represents the rent owing under the tenancy up to
December 31, 2021.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $70.36 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 1, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
5, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest calculated from February 6, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 5, 2022, then starting
February 6, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 6, 2022.

The tenant has until February 4, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by February 4, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on August 6, 2022 if the order
has not been filed on or before
this date with the
Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
