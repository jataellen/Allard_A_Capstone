Jamie Paranuik and Nothstar
Property Management Inc (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Michael
Johnson and Melisa
Johnson (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
13, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Jason Naccarato attended the hearing. As of 9:58 a.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid the
total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from January 1, 2021 to June
30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination
effective March 18, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenants vacated the rental unit on June 30, 2021.
The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.      The lawful monthly
rent was $1,250.00.
 
4.      The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.      The Tenants have made no payments since
the application was filed.
