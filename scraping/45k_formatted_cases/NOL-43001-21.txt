101, 76 ALLARD STREET SAULT STE. MARIE ON P6B5E8


 




Between:


Williams And McDaniel Property Management


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Janice Oldfield
  Tom Oldfield


Tenants



 
 
 
Williams And McDaniel Property
Management (the 'Landlord') applied for an order requiring
Tom Oldfield and Janice Oldfield (the 'Tenants') to pay the rent that
they owe. The Landlord also claimed administration charges related to NSF
cheques.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 20, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s Legal Representative, John Anderson, and the Tenant,
Tom Oldfield, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     At the hearing, the Landlord’s Legal Representative
submitted that the Landlord filed an application on April 19, 2021 with the Board
in order to recover the amount outstanding of
$1,472.95. This amount included
one month’s rent,
an NSF charge and the cost of filing
the application.
 
2.     The Landlord’s Legal Representative explained that the
Tenants left the rental unit a month earlier than expected and stopped payment
on the last cheque for that month.
 
3.     The Tenant submitted
that he and his wife had given notice on March 14, 2021 and that
they would be vacating the rental unit on or before May 31, 2021. However, the
Tenant added that the rental unit was in such bad condition that they were forced to leave early due to health and safety concerns.
 
4.     At the hearing, the Tenant raised issues pursuant to
section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').
These issues included
many areas of mold and rot along with ant infestation. The Tenant
stated that the Landlord had not fixed any of the items mentioned and included
pictures taken in April 2021 which clearly showed the problems in the rental
unit.




File Number: NOL-43001-21
 
 
 
5.     The Landlord’s Legal Representative did not have a satisfactory explanation for the poor
state of the rental unit.
 
6.    
Therefore, given the poor condition of the rental
unit and the fact that the Tenants
had very concerning s.82 issues, I find that the Landlord’s application
for collecting the outstanding arrears cannot proceed.
 
7.     This order contains
all of the reasons in this matter
and no further reasons will be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
