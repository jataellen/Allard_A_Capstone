Michelle Nussler Mildred Kinnersly


Tenants




 
 
Glen Suites (the 'Landlord') applied for an order requiring
Mildred Kinnersly and Michelle Nussler (the 'Tenants') to pay compensation for the damages
caused by them or a person
they permitted in the residential
complex. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after the termination date.
This application was heard by video conference on June
29, 2021, beginning at 9:00 a.m.. The Landlord's Legal Representative Joey Kay attended
the hearing. As of 10:30
a.m., the
Tenants were not present
or represented at this hearing
although properly served with the notice
of this hearing by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Landlord seeks an order granting
the application and for compensation for damages within
the rental unit caused by the Tenants or a
person they permitted in the residential complex.
 
2.       
The Tenants were still in
possession of the rental unit as of the date the application was filed. The Tenants gave vacant possession of the rental
unit to the Landlord
on or before October 31, 2020.
 
3.       
On December 1, 2019 the Tenants
moved into the rental unit pursuant to a residential lease agreement with the Landlord.
The Landlord's Legal Representative submits
that the rental unit was
renovated in September 2019.
 
4.       
On December 2, 2019 the Tenants
and the Landlord
signed a move-in
inspection report, which
informed the Tenants of potential charge-back costs for specific damages if the
Tenants caused such damage within the unit.




 
5.       
The Landlord’s agent inspected the unit on October 15, 2020 and discovered the following damages:
•        
Cracked window
•        
Missing kitchen cabinet door
•        
Drawings on the ceiling
•        
Numerous furniture items that the Tenants
left in the unit
 
6.       
In support of the claim, the
Landlord's Legal Representative presented photographs depicting the damaged items before and after the damages occurred.
Additionally, the Landlord
submitted invoices for the costs of repair and for removal services.
 
7.       
According to the charge-back invoice submitted by the Landlord, compensation for the damages in the amount of $1,035.00 is
claimed as follows:
 
a.   
$250.00   (window repair)
b.   
$75.00 (change locks)
c.   
$200.00 (bulk removal)
d.   
$60.00 (replace cabinet door)
e.   
$350.00 (repainting)
 
8.       
The Landlord also seeks to be reimbursed for the cost of filing
the application.
 
9.       
The application was unopposed.
 
10.    I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that
the Tenants or an occupant of the rental unit or a person permitted in the
residential complex by the Tenants have wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the rental
unit as described above by the Landlord's Legal Representative.
 
11.    I find that the Landlord
has incurred, or will incur, costs of $1,035.00 to repair the damage
and/or replace property that was damaged and cannot be reasonably repaired.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $1,035.00, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage and/or
replacing the damaged property.
 
2.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.       
If the Tenants do not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing on or before February 13, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 14 , 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
