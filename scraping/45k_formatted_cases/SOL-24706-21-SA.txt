Order under Section

Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24706-21-SA
 
 



In the
  matter of:


2, 48 SPRING STREET HAMILTON ON L8N2P3


 




Between:


John Kemp 1749534 Ontario Inc


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


David Smart Rebekah Morrison


Tenants



 
 
 
John Kemp and
1749534 Ontario Inc (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Rebekah Morrison and David Smart (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants entered into an agreement to terminate the tenancy. That application was resolved by order SOL- 24706-21 issued on September 28,
2021.
 
The Tenants
filed a motion to set aside order SOL-24706-21.
 
This motion was heard in Passcode:
910 9539 0063# on December
20, 2021. The Landlord,
represented by Andrew Choubeto, and the Tenant David Smart, attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants signed an N11
agreement to terminate the tenancy. The
Tenants asked the Landlord if he would agree to a delay until June 30, 2021 to which the Landlord did agree.
The Landlord later agreed to delay the termination date until August 31, 2021. The Landlord had another tenant who was
seeking a larger unit. The Landlord
informed this tenant that this unit would be available September 1, 2021. The Tenants did not vacate the unit.
 
2.    
The Tenants acknowledge
they were intending to move because they want a larger space for their family,
but after they signed the N11 the housing market
changed. As a result they were finding it more
difficult to find another rental unit that
suits their needs.
 
3.     It is clear the Tenants
signed the N11 with the intent to vacate the rental unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
requested a delay in lifting
the stay to allow more time to vacate the unit.
The Landlord agreed to a delay until February 28, 2022.
