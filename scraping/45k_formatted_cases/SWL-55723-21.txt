Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number:
SWL-55723-21
 



In the matter
of:


215, 333 GLENGARRY AVENUE WINDSOR ON N9A1P6


 




Between:


Windsor Essex
Community Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


John Boismier


Tenant



 
 
Windsor Essex Community Housing
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict John Boismier (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 20, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Madeline Roy, attended the hearing.
As of 10:22 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period
from June 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective October
12, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $421.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
6.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before February 11, 2022.

2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$3,386.33*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 31, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $13.84
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
11, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 12, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 11, 2022, then starting February
12, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 12, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$3,554.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$3,975.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 11, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph
and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 12, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
