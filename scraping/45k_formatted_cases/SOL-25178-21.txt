Order under Section

Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-25178-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


31 CECIL STREET
ST CATHARINES ON L2N4B3


 




Between:


DRT Custom
Homes and Renovations Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Adam Lone
  Taylor Lee


Tenants



 
 
 
DRT Custom Homes and Renovations
Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Adam Lone and Taylor Lee (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on January 18, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s Legal Representative,
Josh McDougall, attended the hearing. As of 1:58 p.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 27, 2021.
1.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
2.     The lawful monthly
rent is $
 
3.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the parties and whether
the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




File Number: SOL-25178-21
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,

$9,731.09*, which represents the amount of rent

to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing*
on or before February 6, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 7,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 6, 2022, then starting
February 7, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.

of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 7, 2022.

and continue the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:

$10,186.00 if the payment
is made on or before January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$12,186.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 6, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not
make full payment in
accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 7, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
