or represented at the hearing

of this hearing by the Board.

the rental unit on November
7, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date

4.    
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant paid $1,500.00 after the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of November
7, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$6,782.56*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to November 7, 2021.

does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before

be simple interest calculated from February 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
