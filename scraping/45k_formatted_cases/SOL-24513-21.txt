Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24513-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


507, 111 CHURCH STREET ST. CATHARINES ON L2R3C9


 




Between:


Bethlehem Housing &
Support Services


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Dawn Searle
  Scott Rolfe


Tenants



 
 
 
Bethlehem Housing & Support Services (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Scott Rolfe and Dawn Searle
(the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 14, 2021. Only the Landlord's Agent, Kathy Fraser and the Landlord's Legal Representative, Judith Callender, attended
the hearing. As of 10:04 a.m.,
the Tenants were not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the
Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from April
1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
5, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $907.00.
 
4.    
The Tenants
paid $700.00 after
the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $907.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent
deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from July 1, 2020 to December
31, 2020.
 
7.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including
the impact of COVID-19 on the




 
parties and whether the
Landlord attempted to negotiate a
repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Landlord sent letters to the Tenant on the necessity of a
repayment agreement. The Landlord’s attempts at negotiating a repayment
agreement were unsuccessful as the Tenant made no payments after the
application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental
unit on or before January 15, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $5,541.26*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 4, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $29.82 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 5, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 15, 2022, the
Tenants will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January 16, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
January 16, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 15, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $7,422.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenants
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or
after January 16, 2022 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant
possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
