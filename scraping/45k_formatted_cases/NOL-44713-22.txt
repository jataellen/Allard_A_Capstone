Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44713-22
 
 



In the
  matter of:


1, 134 ADIE STREET SUDBURY ON P3C2C8


 




Between:


5010953 Ontario
Limited


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Dan Primeau


Tenant



 
 
 
5010953 Ontario Limited (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dan Primeau
(the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes
because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified
in the mediated settlement issued by the Board on January 20, 2022 with
respect to application NOL-44219-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The mediated settlement provided that the Landlord
could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the
Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the settlement.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following condition
specified in the settlement: The Tenant failed to pay the lawful
monthly rent in full, on or before February 1, 2022.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting mediated settlement required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of
the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request
an order for the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The amount that is still owing, according to the terms
of the mediated settlement, for arrears of rent, and the costs related
to the application fee for the previous
application is
$2,436.00.
 
5.     Since the date of the mediated settlement, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that
became owing for the period from February 1, 2022 to February 28, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:




File Number: NOL-44713-22
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before March 5, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall
pay to the Landlord $2,636.96*. This amount represents the rent owing up to February 22, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $29.59 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 23, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March 5, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from March 6, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 5, 2022, then starting
March 6, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 6, 2022.

Board will schedule a hearing.
