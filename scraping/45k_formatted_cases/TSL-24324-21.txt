Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-24324-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


21 LOUNT STREET TORONTO ON M4J5A1


 




Between:


Nishnawbe Homes
Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Stephanie Pangowish


Tenant



 
 
 
Nishnawbe Homes Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Stephanie Pangowish (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that
the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
way of video conference on January 12, 2022. Only the Landlord’s legal representative Carrie
Aylwin attended the hearing. As of
10:21am the Tenant was not present despite being served with notice of hearing
from the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
June 1, 2017 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective September
19, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
3.     The arrears of rent claimed
exceed the Board’s
monetary jurisdiction of $35,000.00. The Landlord’s legal representative
understood that in accordance with section 207(3) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act), by pursuing this application before the Board,
the Landlord cannot claim any arrears
in excess of $35,000,00 in a new application or before
a Court of competent jurisdiction.
 
4.     While the Board cannot order a person
to pay more than $35,000.00, I find that this does not apply to “stay and pay” option
set out in paragraph 7 below, as the Tenant is not required to pay that amount.
The Tenant has the option of paying the amount in paragraph 7 if they wish to
continue tenancy.
 
5.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties
and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with




 
the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1)
of the Act.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 27, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $35,000.00*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 16, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
27, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 28, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 27, 2022, then starting
February 28, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 28, 2022.
 
7.     If, on or before February 27, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $66,446.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction
will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and
the Tenant could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 28, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
