Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006

In the matter
of:


77, 50 EMPRINGHAM DRIVE SCARBOROUGH ON M1B3Z7


 




Between:


Toronto Community Housing Corp.


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Tasha Callahan


Tenant



 
 
 
Toronto Community Housing Corp
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tasha Callahan
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant or another occupant
of the rental unit has committed an illegal act or has carried out, or permitted someone
to carry out an illegal
trade, business or occupation in the rental unit or the residential
complex. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 25, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Jesse
Audette, attended the hearing. As of 11:45 a.m., the Tenant was not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Jody Robinson testified on behalf of the Landlord.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     For the reasons
that follow, I find that the Tenant,
a guest or an occupant
committed an illegal act on
the residential complex.
 
2.    
On October 5, 2021, the Landlord
served the Tenant a N6 Notice of Eviction. The notice
was dated October 5, 2021 and had a termination date of November 5, 2021.
 
3.    
The notice seeks to terminate the tenancy because
the Landlord alleges a
guest of the Tenant’s sone stole a bicycle from a
neighbouring tenant.
 
4.     Jody Robinson (JR) the Community Safety Advisor, testified on behalf of the Landlord. JR testified that part of his role is to review incident
reports. The report in question is with respect to an incident on March 25,
2021; a Special Constable responded to a call from unit 73 about a bike being
stolen from their front yard. The police had CCTV video which showed a young person with a hood walk up to the bike sitting
by unit 73’s driveway, take




 
it and walk away. The police
determined that the person who stole the bike came from unit 77 and was with the Tenant’s son; the Tenant’s
son would not say who took the bike.
 
5.     JR also testified that the Special Constable spoke to
the Toronto Police as well as the Community
Safety Unit with respect to the theft;
antisocial behaviour is a problem
in this community, and it is
challenging to find ways to work together with the community towards positive
results.
 
6.     The Landlord's Legal Representative submitted that the Landlord
takes illegal acts seriously, but this is a first-time
occurrence, therefore the Landlord is seeking a conditional order and the
application filing fee.
 
Analysis
 
7.     Section 61 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’) says:
 
(1)   A landlord may give a tenant notice
of termination of the tenancy if the tenant or another occupant of the rental unit commits an illegal act or carries on an illegal
trade, business or occupation or permits a person to do so in the rental unit or the residential
complex.
 
(2)  
A notice
of termination under this
section shall set out the grounds for termination and shall provide a
termination date not earlier than,
 
(a)  
the 10th day after
the notice is given, in the case of a notice grounded on an illegal act, trade,
business or occupation involving,
 
(i) 
the production of an illegal drug,
 
(ii)  
the trafficking in an illegal drug, or
 
(iii) 
the possession of an illegal drug for the purposes of trafficking
 
(b)  
the 20th day after the notice is given, in all other cases.
 
8.    
A
landlord who gives a tenant a notice of termination pursuant to section 61(1) of the Act must establish on a balance of probabilities that
either the tenant or an occupant committed the illegal act or the tenant or an
occupant permitted a person to commit the illegal act.
 
9.    
Based on the
uncontested testimony before me, I find a guest of the Tenant’s son committed
an illegal Act when he stole the mountain bike from outside of unit 73 in the
residential complex. This is an illegal act under the Criminal Code (R.S.C., 1985,
c. C-46) section 322 (1) and
is also contrary to section 61(1) of the Act.




 
Relief from Eviction
 
10.   I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction subject to the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act. The Landlord’s resolution is reasonable.
 
11.  This order contains
all the reasons for the decision within
it. No further reasons shall be
issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s application for
eviction of the Tenant is denied on the condition that the Tenant, occupant, or
guest do not commit an illegal act in the rental unit or residential complex.
 
2.    
If the Tenant, an occupant or a guest fail to abide by the condition
in paragraph 1, then the Landlord may apply under
section 78 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’) for an order
terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord must make the
application within 30 days of a breach of a condition set out in paragraph 1 of
this order.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February
13, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 14, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
