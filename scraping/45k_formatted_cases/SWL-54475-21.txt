Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-54475-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


962 ALBERT ROAD WINDSOR ON N8Y3P2


 




Between:


Raunak Jahan
  Naimul Hasan


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Jennifer
Woodrich Pamela Woodrich


Tenants



 
 
 
Raunak Jahan and Naimul Hasan (the 'Landlords') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict Jennifer
Woodrich and Pamela
Woodrich (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 16, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Tim Currie, attended the hearing. As of 2:09 p.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from June 1, 2021 to December
31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of
Termination effective July 23, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,200.00.
 
4.    
The Tenants
have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
6.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act. The
amount outstanding is substantial, and the Tenants have not paid any rent since
the application was filed.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 17, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlords $8,245.55*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 6, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also
pay to the Landlords $39.45 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting January 7, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before January 17, 2022, the
Tenants will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 18, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January 18, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after
January 18, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 17, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $9,336.00** to the Landlords or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenants
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after January 18, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenants are only
entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlords.
