Order under Section 21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-98918-18-RV
 
Review Order
 
I.M.P..L(the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict S.C (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's
rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
This
application was resolved by order TSL-98918-18 issued on November 8, 2018.
 
On November 14, 2018, the Tenant requested a review of the order,
and that the order be stayed until the request to review is resolved.
 
On October 12, 2018, order TSL-98918-18-RV-IN was issued, staying
the order issued on November 8, 2018.
 
The
request to review was heard in Toronto on December 6, 2018. The Landlord’s representative,
H.T (HT), legal representative, J.S, and the Tenant attended the hearing.
            
Determinations:
 
Request
for Review
1.      This
request for review was sent for hearing on the issue of whether the Tenant’s
short term rental of the unit should have been part of the circumstances
considered pursuant to subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act').  
2.      The
Tenant testified that the issue of the short term rental had been raised by the
then legal representative of the Landlord in cross-examination.  He testified
that he argued that the issue was not relevant to the circumstances of his
persistent late payment of rent.  
3.      HT
testified that the Tenant admitted to arranging a short term rental of his unit
while he was out of town in a telephone conversation she had with him.  She
conceded that she had not attended the first hearing, but testified she had
been told by the legal representative who attended the hearing that the issue
of the short term rental had been raised by the Tenant in his evidence.  It was
conceded that while the Landlord had informed the Tenant that short term
rentals were not permitted, the Landlord had not brought any application
against the Tenant in regard to the short term rental. 
4.     
The Member relied on the evidence of the short term rental as an
important part of the circumstances in subsection 83(2) of the Act, to deny
relief from eviction.  I find, on a balance of probabilities, that it was not reasonable
for evidence of the short term rental, however it arose, to be considered in
the circumstances of the relief from eviction because it was not evidence of
conduct related to the Notice of Termination.  The request for review is
therefore granted.
 
L2
Application
 
5.     
The Tenant admits that he has been persistently late in paying his
rent.
 
6.     
The Tenant testified that he is a self-employed contractor and
that he receives his income from payments for his work, which provides him with
irregular cash flow which is the reason why he is persistently late with his
rent, but emphasized that he always pays the rent.  
 
7.     
The Tenant further testified that he has been a tenant since May
2017 though he lived previously in the residential complex with an
ex-girlfriend.  He has opened up an office for his work nearby and would like
to stay in the unit because of its convenience and that he likes the area.  He
lives alone in the unit.  
 
8.     
The Tenant testified that he has not paid December’s rent because
he wanted to see what happened with his request for review but says that he has
the money to pay December’s rent.  The Tenant could not corroborate the
availability of money for December rent through any bank information.
 
9.     
The Tenant conceded that he was served with an N4 for non-payment
of rent in January, 2018, that went to a Board hearing, which he did not
attend, and that he voided the order on April 6, 2018 after receiving notice of
the Sheriff’s intention to attend and evict.
 
10.   The
Tenant also conceded that there was a second L1 application brought for new
arrears of rent, which he paid off on June 27, 2018.  
 
11.   The
Tenant further conceded that he has never paid the rent on time since the first
month of his tenancy, and that there has been a balance outstanding on rent ledger
since August 14, 2018.  
 
12.   The
Landlord submitted that even as of the date of hearing, the Tenant does not
have a zero balance on the rent ledger and has no evidence to show any ability
to pay.  He also submitted the short history of the tenancy demonstrates that
the Tenant has been given chances to show that he can pay on time, but has
never done so.  The Landlord asked for termination of the tenancy on December
31, 2018.  
 
13.   The
Tenant submitted that he should be given a conditional order and that he would
comply and pay on time in the future.
 
14.   The
Tenant has admitted to persistent late payment of rent, which he attributes to
his work situation and the difficulties with cash flow.  The Tenant produced no
evidence that his situation will be any different in the future or any evidence
of his ability to bring the rent ledger to a zero balance. I see no reasonable
prospect that a conditional order would be complied with by the Tenant and that
it would likely further prejudice the Landlord who has already had to bring
three applications to the Board concerning payment of rent within an 18 month
tenancy.
 
15.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Act and find that it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.  Because of the holiday
period, I will delay the eviction until January 5, 2019.  
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
request to review is granted. Order TSL-98918-18 issued on November 8, 2018 is
cancelled and replaced by the following order. 
2.      The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 5, 2019.
3.      If
the Tenant vacates the unit on or after December 31, 2018, the Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord $49.37 per day for compensation for the use of the
unit from January 1, 2019 to January 5, 2019, the date of eviction.  
4.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before January 5, 2019, then starting January 6,
2019, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
5.     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 6, 2019.
6.     If
the unit is not vacated by January 5, 2019, the Tenant shall also pay to the
Landlord $49.37 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from January 6,
2019 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
