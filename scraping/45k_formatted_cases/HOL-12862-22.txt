terminate the tenancy as of January 3, 2022 and the Tenant did not move out of the rental
unit by the termination date
set out in the agreement.
 
It is
ordered that:

the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 7, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
February 7, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 8, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 7, 2022, then starting
