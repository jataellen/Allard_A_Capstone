Asif Chahal


Tenant



 
 
 
Pinedale Properties Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Asif Chahal (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 31, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative Franki Dash attended the hearing. As of 2:53 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
2.     As of
January 1, 2022, the monthly
rent for the unit is
$1,112.56.
 
3.     The Tenant paid $5,508.18 after the application was filed.
 
4.    
The Tenant paid almost
all of the arrears for the period
ending January 31, 2022,
after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The only other amount
outstanding is the Landlord's cost of filing the application. As a result, the order
will not include eviction.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1.86,
which represents the amount of rent owing up to January 31, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.

If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before February
22, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 23, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
