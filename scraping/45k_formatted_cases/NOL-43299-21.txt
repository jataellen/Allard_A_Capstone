Paula Cooper


Tenant



 
 
John Miller (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Paula Cooper
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the
Tenant's rent.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 25, 2021.
Both the Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.     Based on the evidence provided
by the Landlord and the submissions provided
by the Tenant, I find that
the Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
2.     The Tenant was served with an N8 notice pursuant to
subsection 58(1)(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’) on June 22, 2021 which alleged
persistently late payment of rent. The
termination date in the notice is August 31, 2021.
 
3.     Between December 2020 to June 2021 the Tenant had paid rent late for 6 out of 7 months as outlined in the N8 notice. Rent is due on the first day of each
month.
 
4.    
The Landlord testified that since the N8 was served, the July 2021 rent was late, but the
August, September and October rent had all been paid on time.
 
Section 83 Considerations
 
5.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from
eviction subject to the condition(s)
set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.




 
6.    
The Landlord requested an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant as their
first preference in an order from the Board.
In the alternative, the Landlord requested an order for the Tenant to
pay on time for at least one year.
 
7.     The Tenant testified that in December 2020 the rental
property changed management and she was unsure of who she was supposed
to pay rent to. She became aware when
she received an N4 Notice.
 
8.     The Tenant testified that she utilized the N4 notice
as a reminder of the date to pay her rent and felt as though
this was implied
consent for the Tenant to be able to pay rent late. The Tenant’s position is that she
always eventually pays the rent and she shouldn’t be evicted.
 
9.     The Tenant testified that she spoke with the Landlord
on June 22nd or 23rd after receiving the N8 notice. She indicated that the Landlord
told her that if she was able to pay on time, then she should not have any
further issues.
 
10. 
The Tenant indicated that she has gained full time employment with better pay and that her pay schedule is now bi-monthly on
the 15th and 30th of the
month. Payments were previously
bi-weekly which made it difficult to manage and she was previously trying to manage 3 jobs, where now she only has to
manage 2 jobs with better pay.
 
11.  Since the Tenant has taken initiative to put herself
in a better financial position and has been paying the rent on time since being served with the N8 notice,
I find that it would not
be unfair to make a conditional order pursuant to section 78 of the Act in the circumstances.
 
12.  Such an order balances the prejudice to the Landlord
with an order requiring rent to be paid on the first of the month, while
also providing the Tenant with an opportunity to preserve the tenancy.
 
13.  I am
mindful that the hearing took place in October of 2021 and the order
is being issued in January 2022. I find it appropriate under the
circumstances to account for the rent for the months of November and December
as part of this order if they have not already been paid by the Tenant. The
Landlord shall have a pay on time order for roughly one year from when this
decision is issued.
 
14.  Since the Landlord
is successful on their application, I will also order that the Tenant
pay to the Landlord the $186.00 filing fee cost.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application on or before February
28, 2022.
 
2.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the filing fee on or before February
28, 2022 the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated
from March 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.




 
3.    
The Landlord’s application for eviction
of the Tenant is denied on the condition that the Tenant pay the rent as it becomes
due on or before the first day of each month starting January 1, 2022 and continuing
to the period ending December 31, 2022
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay the rent for November
2021 on or before January
31, 2022.
 
5.     The Tenant shall also pay the rent for December
2021 on or before January
31, 2022.
 
6.     If the Tenant fails to make any of the payments outlined
in paragraphs 3 to 5 of this order,
then the Landlord may, within 30 days of the breach and without notice to the
Tenant, apply to the Board pursuant to subsection 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenant.
