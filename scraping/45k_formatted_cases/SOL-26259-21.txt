File Number: SOL-26259-21




In the matter
of:


108, 42 NASH
ROAD SOUTH HAMILTON ON
  L8K4J6


 




Between:


Butty Property Management Inc


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Stacey
Gibson


Tenant



 
 
On November
10,2021, Butty Property Management Inc (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Stacey
Gibson (the 'Tenant') and for an
order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because
the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order
issued by the Board on November 5, 2021 with respect to application
SOL-22857-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed
to pay to the Landlord
$763.60 on or before November
1, 2021 towards rent.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $6,294.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's
application fee in Order SOL-22857-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $5,507.25
and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous
order SOL-22857-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $750.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 1, 2017 to January 5, 2022.




File Number: SOL-26259-21
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Order SOL-22857-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 16, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,476.42*. This amount represents the rent owing up to November 30, 2021 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $25.10
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting December 1, 2021 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
16, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January
16, 2022, then starting January
17, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 17, 2022.

The tenant has until January 15, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 15, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
