Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12444-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


826, 90 BROADVIEW AVENUE TORONTO ON M4M0A7


 




Between:


Anne Lachance


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Yoel Tedla


Tenant



 
 
 
Anne Lachance (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Yoel Tedla
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the
Tenant's rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on February
1, 2022. The Landlord,
represented by Sergey Bogdanov, and the Tenant, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has been consistently paying the rent a couple
of days late. The Tenant
is seeking relief from eviction.
 
2.     Rent is due on the 15th of each month.
 
3.     I find that under the circumstances relief
with conditions should
be ordered as set out below.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord the lawful rent
in full and on time for each consecutive month commencing February 2022 and continuing through
January 2023.
 
2.     In the event the Tenant fails to make the above said
payment in full and on time, the Landlord shall be entitled to apply to the
Board, no later than 30 days after a breach of this Order, without notice to the Tenant, for an Order terminating the tenancy and evicting
the Tenant, pursuant to Section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of the application on or before February 28, 2022.




File Number: HOL-12444-21
 
 
 
4.     The Landlord has the right to collect
the full amount at any time after
February 28, 2022.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the full amount owing by February 28, 2022 the Tenant will owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated at 2% annually on the outstanding balance.
