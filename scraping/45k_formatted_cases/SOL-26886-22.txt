File Number: SOL-26886-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


2412 BAINTREE CRESCENT OAKVILLE ON L6M4X1


 




Between:


Ju-Hwan Lee


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Fatmaeelzahraa Talaat
  Khaled Mansour


Tenants



 
 
 
Ju-Hwan Lee (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Khaled Mansour and Fatmaeelzahraa Talaat
(the 'Tenants') because the Tenants entered into an agreement to terminate the
tenancy
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord and the Tenants
signed an agreement to terminate the tenancy as of April 30, 2022.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before April 30, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
April 30, 2022, then starting
May 1, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after May 1, 2022.
