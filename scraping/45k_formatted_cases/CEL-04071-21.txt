Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-04071-21
 
 



In the matter of:


21
  LOCKSLEY PLACE BRAMPTON ON L6S2P6


 




Between:


Kulvinderjit Kaur Bhupender Singh


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Milton Fernando Jency
Anoma Thamithurai Jegatheeswaran


Tenants



 
 
 
Kulvinderjit Kaur and Bhupender Singh (the 'Landlords') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict Milton Fernando Jency Anoma and
Thamithurai Jegatheeswaran (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The
Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the
unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard via video conference on January 20,
2022.
 
The Landlords, the Landlords’ legal representative, Jeff Rodriguez, the second-named Tenant and the Tenants’ legal
representative, T. Sivapatham, attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
For the following reasons,
I find that the Landlords’ application must be dismissed.
 
2.    
At the hearing, the Landlords
confirmed that the rental property is divided into two separate rental units.
The Tenant lives on the main floor, and the basement has a separate entrance
and is a separate rental
unit. At one point, another
tenant occupied the basement unit and the Landlords
actually now live in the basement.
 
3.    
As I explained at the hearing,
because the Tenants
do not occupy the entire
house and, in fact, only occupy the main floor unit, this unit needs to
be identified on the notice of termination.
 
4.    
The Landlords served a notice of termination pursuant to subsection 48(1)(a) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'). The notice
fails to identify
the main floor rental unit.




File Number: CEL-04071-21
 
5.    
Subsection 43(1)(a) states that every notice
of termination must identify the rental
unit. In the matter before me, as the notice fails to
identify the rental unit, it
does not comply with the mandatory requirements of the Act and is invalid. As
the notice of termination is invalid, the Landlords’ application must be
dismissed.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.    
The Landlords’ application is dismissed.
