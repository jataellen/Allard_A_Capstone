Statutory Powers

and the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 










 

Review Order
 
JL (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict CK and GB (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay
the rent that the Tenants owe (L1 application).
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenants because they, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another tenant; and because they have been persistently late
in paying their rent (L2 application).
 
This L1/L2 application was resolved by order
CEL-76112-18 issued on July 5, 2018.
 
On August 14, 2018, the Tenant, CK, requested a review
of that order.
 
The Tenant’s request was heard in Mississauga on
September 5, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Preliminary Matter:
 
The application is amended to
remove GB as a party/tenant. There is no dispute
that he moved out of the rental unit months ago and is no longer in possession
of the unit.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant did not attend
the hearing that took place on June 26, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant was not
reasonably able to participate in that hearing. She did not receive the Notice
of Hearing and was unaware of the hearing. The address that the Landlord
provided on the application for the Tenant is not the Tenant’s mailing address.
As a result, the Notice of Hearing that the Board mailed to the Tenant was
never received by her. The Tenant’s review request is granted.
3.     
The determinations made in
the July 5, 2018 order regarding the L2 application remain unchanged, particularly
with respect to the N5 notice of termination. That portion of the Landlord’s
claim was dismissed. No serious error is alleged in the review request
regarding those determinations.
4.     
The Tenant does not dispute
the persistent late payment of the rent or the amount of rent arrears owing.
5.     
The monthly rent was
$2,400.00. ODSP has been paying $2,000.00 of that amount directly to the
Landlord each month. The Tenant is responsible for the remaining $400.00 and
there is no dispute that this portion of the rent was persistently paid late.
6.     
The monthly rent increased
to $2,443.20 as of September 1, 2018.
7.     
The Tenant has not paid $4,043.20
of the total rent she was required to pay for the period from May 1, 2018 to
September 30, 2018. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a N4 Notice of
Termination.
8.     
However, the Tenant paid
$2,400.00 to the Board in trust since the application was filed. This amount is
deducted from the rent arrears owing to the Landlord resulting in a balance of
$1,643.20 owing to September 30, 2018.
9.     
In addition the Tenant owes
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of fling this application.
10.  
The amount owing is
undisputed.
11.  
The $2,400.00 that was paid
into the Board by the Tenant and any accumulated interest, shall be paid out to
the Landlord.
12.  
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $2,400.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
13.  
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from August 17, 2017 to September 1,
2018.
14.  
The Tenant has arranged for
assistance from numerous community agencies to pay the amount owing. She
requested a delay to September 30, 2018 to pay the amount owing.
15.  
The Landlord was opposed to
any delay. However, the delay requested is reasonable and is intended to result
in the full balance owing being paid to the Landlord. 
16.  
The Tenant stated that she
can pay the full rent owing on time from now on since her ODSP income has
increased and ODSP can now pay the full rent directly to the Landlord each
month.
17.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Order CEL-76112-18, issued
on July 5, 2018, is varied in the following manner:
Regarding the L1 rent arrears application:
2.     
Unless the Tenant voids the rent
arrears portion of this order as set out below, the tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before September 30, 2018.
3.     
As of the date of this
order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the Landlord is
entitled to by $2,281.27*.
4.     
However, the Landlord is
authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the Landlord owes
the Tenant: $80.32 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
September 13, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit, and
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
The Landlord or the Tenant
shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before September 30, 2018, then starting October 1, 2018, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after October 1, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before
September 30, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $1,833.20** to the Landlord
or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction related to the rent arrears will
be void.  This means that
the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit. 
If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this
order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to void the rent arrears
portion of this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after October 1, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
10.  
The Board shall pay to the
Landlord the amount of $2,400.00 together with any accrued interest. 
Regarding the L2 persistent late rent application:
11.   If the Tenant pays the amount required to void
the rent arrears portion of this order, then the tenancy will continue subject
to the following conditions:
12.   The Tenant shall pay the Landlord the full monthly rent on or before
the first day of each month for a twelve month period commencing October 2018
through to and including September 2019.
13.   If the Tenant fails to make any one of the
payments ordered in paragraph 12, in full and on time, the Landlord may apply
under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, without notice
to the Tenant for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The
Landlord must make this application no later than 30 days after the Tenant’s
failure to make a payment.
