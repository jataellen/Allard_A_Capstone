Barbara Demontagnac (the 'Tenant') filed a motion
to set aside order

was enforced, the Tenant paid the amount
required under subsection 74(11) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') to void the order.
 
This motion was heard by video conference on December 3, 2021.
Only the Tenant attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not previously made a motion
under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside an eviction order during the
period of the Tenant's tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
2.    
The uncontested evidence of the Tenant was that she has paid to the Landlord the amount required under subsection
74(11) of the Act to void the eviction order.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    Order CEL-99285-21 is void and cannot be enforced by the Landlord.
