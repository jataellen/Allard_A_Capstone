In the matter
of:


255, 7555 GOREWAY DRIVE MISSISSAUGA ON L4T3M9


 




Between:


Siteline (7555
Goreway) Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Lisa Roszak


Tenant



 
 
 
Siteline (7555 Goreway) Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Lisa Roszak (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 17, 2022. Only the Landlord’s representative, S. McCarthur, attended
the hearing. As of 2:49 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
28, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022 the monthly rent for the unit is
$783.48.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $757.54 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 1, 2014 to January 28, 2022.
 
6.    
The Tenant paid $2,350.00
after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the
parties and whether the Landlord
attempted to negotiate
a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 4, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $327.03*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
24, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $25.76
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 25, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
4, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 5, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 4, 2022, then starting
February 5, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 5, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i) $1,416.28 if the payment is made on or before
January 31, 2022,
or ii)$2,199.76 if the payment is made on or before February 4, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act
to set aside this order if they pay
the amount required under that subsection on or after February 5, 2022 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
