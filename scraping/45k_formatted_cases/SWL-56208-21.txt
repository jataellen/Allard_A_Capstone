Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jessica Macmillan


Tenant



 
Eastwood Housing Corporation (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jessica
Macmillan (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant or another occupant of the rental
unit has committed an illegal act or has carried out, or permitted
someone to carry out an illegal trade, business or occupation in the
rental unit or the residential complex involving the production of an illegal
drug, the trafficking in an illegal drug or the possession of an illegal drug
for the purposes of trafficking; because the Tenant has knowingly
misrepresented the Tenant's income or the income of other members of the
Tenant's family who occupy the unit
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
12, 2022 at 9:00am.
 
Only the Landlord’s agent,
Deb Carter, attended
the hearing when the matter was called at 9:27am. The Landlord was represented by
Theresa Forrest.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord’s L2 application was based on a N6 notice
of termination served to the Tenant on October
29, 2021 with a termination date of November
18, 2021 pursuant
to sections 60 and 61 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006.
 
2.     At the hearing,
the Landlord’s representative sought to proceed
on the allegation pursuant to subsection 60(1) only as the illegal acts
referred to on the notice of termination did not occur at the residential
complex.
 
3.     I proceeded to hear the Landlord’s allegation of the Tenant knowingly and materially
misrepresenting her income.
 
L2 APPLICATION
 
4.     Pursuant to subsection 60(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’),
a landlord may give a tenant
notice to terminate the tenancy if the rental unit is described under
subsection 7(1) of the Act and a tenant knowingly and materially misrepresents
his or her income or that of other
members of the household occupying the rental unit.




 
5.    
The Landlord is a social housing
provider and falls
under the exception set out in subsection 7(1)(2) of the Act.
 
6.     As of the hearing date, the Tenant
is in possession of the rental unit which is a three- bedroom townhouse in a family
complex.
 
7.     The Tenant lives
in a rent-geared-to-income unit and as such the Tenant
is required to complete an annual review
which provides details to the Landlord
including household
composition, household income and
assets to determine the appropriate
rent subsidy. She is also required to report changes in the family’s
composition and income as they occur. It is the Landlord’s position that the
Tenant is misrepresenting the household income.
 
8.     At the hearing,
the Landlord’s agent,
Deb Carter (DC), who is the tenant
co-ordinator and whose job it
is to collect documents and calculate rent to ensure tenants are eligible for
the rent-geared-to-income subsidy, explained that when individuals are added or
removed from the household composition, it results in changes to the income and
therefore the rent. If, for example, a second tenant is added and does not have
income, the rent would stay the same in most circumstances; however, if a
second tenant is added and receives social assistance, that could change the
rent calculations as it is additional income in the household.
 
9.     DC testified that the lease agreement between the
Landlord and the Tenant commenced on
January 1, 2017. The Tenant’s income was $144.00 and a last month's rent
deposit was being held in the same amount.
The market rent for this unit was $938.00. As part of the lease agreement, only the Tenant
and her two children were listed as occupants of the rental unit.
 
10.  DC testified that upon receiving complaints from other
tenants of the residential complex that James Boyd was living in the rental
unit with the Tenant, the Landlord inquired with the Tenant and provided her
with multiple opportunities to present government documentation to the Landlord
to either confirm
that JB was not living
at the rental unit or make a request to add JB to the tenancy
and disclose his income for a recalculation of the rent.
 
11.  DC testified that she corresponded with the Tenant on
the following dates and sent reminders: May 14 and 27, 2021, June 2, 2021,
July 14, 2021, and July 30, 2021.
Copies of this correspondence was submitted in evidence. DC testified
that the Tenant responded by presenting a bank profile
page extracted online that shows
JB’s address as not being the rental unit address,
however, the Landlord reminded the Tenant that government documentation was
required. Since then, DC did not hear back from the Tenant in this regard.
 
12.  DC testified further that JB’s ex-spouse provided emails
where on June 16, 2021, JB requests packages to be delivered to the rental
unit, indicating that he
has moved five days prior from his old place.
 
13.  The Landlord seeks
a termination of the tenancy
and reimbursement of the application filing fee.




 
ANALYSIS
 
14.  Based on the uncontested evidence
before the Board, I find, on a balance of probabilities,
that JB is living at the rental unit. I say this based on the Landlord’s
testimony that they have received many complaints that JB is living with the
Tenant, their maintenance personnel have seen JB at the premises at all hours,
JB’s vehicles are parked on the property throughout the day and night and the
email thread where JB indicates that he has moved and provides the rental unit
address as his delivery address. Finally, the St. Thomas police have indicated
to the Landlord that the JB has listed the rental unit as his address when they
attended the premises to search for him.
 
15.  In Nipissing and Parry Sound Districts House Authority v. Tremblay 1979 CanLII 1886 (ON SC), [1979] O.J. No. 4103, 23
O.R. (2d) 566 (Ont. Dist. Ct.), the Court found that where the lease requires the tenant
to report changes of income, the tenant’s silence constitutes misrepresentation
of income.
 
16.  In Toronto Community
Housing Corp. v. McGowan [2016] O.J. No 134, 2016 ONSC 172
(Ont. Div. Ct.) the Court found that it did not matter whether the tenant actually received any money from an
occupant residing at the rental unit; where the income was not disclosed, it
was sufficient to constitute a misrepresentation of income.
 
17.  Finally, in District of Muskoka-Housing v. Arsenault, [2002] O.R.H.T.D. No. 88 (O.R.H.T.),
the tenant claimed her friend
was not an occupant and that he lived at his mother’s
home, although he was frequently at the premises. The adjudicator held
that a person could have more than one residence … the friend was residing at
the unit and his income should have been disclosed. Eviction was ordered.
 
18.  In applying the case law above, I am satisfied that
the Tenant has knowingly and materially misrepresented her income. I say this
based on the Tenant’s failure to clarify for
the Landlord that JB is not living
there and/or provide
documentation to add him to the
tenancy, despite being reminded and provided with numerous opportunities to do
so. As the Tenant is the only one who is able to respond to the Landlord’s
query, I draw a negative inference from her failure to produce these documents
for the Landlord.
 
19.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
the Act. The Landlord is unaware of any circumstances that would justify relief
from eviction.
 
20.  This order contains
all of the reasons
for the decision within it. No further
reasons shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of November 18, 2021. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 25, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.




 
3.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before January
25, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 26, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit is not vacated on or
before January 25, 2022, then starting January
26, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
5.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 26, 2022. The Sheriff is requested to expedite the enforcement
of this order.
