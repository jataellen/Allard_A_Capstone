Order under Section
78(11)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-20068-21-SA
 



In the matter
of:


809, 250 BRENYON
WAY TORONTO ON M1B3G3


 




Between:


Brenyon Way Charitable Foundation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Robert
Bryan


Tenant



 
 
Brenyon Way Charitable Foundation (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Robert
Bryan (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent he owes
because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by
the Board on January 8, 2021 with respect to application TEL-11087-20.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved
by order TEL-20068-21, issued on November
4, 2021. The Tenant filed a
motion to set aside order TEL-20068-21.
 
This motion
was heard by videoconference on January 6, 2022.
Only the Landlord’s representative, Bryan Rubin, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The application is amended to remove a second named tenant respondent. He moved out of the
rental unit in 2018.
 
2.    
The Tenant failed to attend the hearing. The Landlord has received credible
information from his family that the Tenant passed away on December 18,
2021. As a result, the motion shall be denied.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The motion
to set aside Order TEL-20068-21, issued on November
4, 2021, is denied.
 
2.     The stay of order TEL-20068-21 is lifted immediately.
