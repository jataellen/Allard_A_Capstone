Darren Bazinet


Tenant



 
 
Glen Haslam (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Darren Bazinet (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's
rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on October 25, 2021.
 
The Landlord, represented by Angie Gravelle,
attended the hearing.
The Tenant was not present or represented as of 9:44am
despite being served with the notice of hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     Based on the uncontested evidence of the Landlord, I
find that the Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due
by the first of the month.
 
2.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $650.00
from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
3.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period from September 1, 2020 to September
30, 2021.
 
4.     The Tenant was served with an N8 notice pursuant to
subsection 58(1)(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’) on July 2, 2021 which alleged
persistently late payment of
rent. The termination date in the
notice is September 30, 2021.
 
5.     The Landlord testified that the Tenant
has been late 11 times over a period of 12 months and that the Tenant has only paid
the September 2021 rent on time.
 
6.    
The Landlord
testified that after the N8 notice was served, the Tenant paid July rent late
on July 14th; the Tenant
paid August rent on August 4th; September rent was paid on August 31st and the October rent had not been paid until October 14th.




 
7.    
Based on the history of the Tenant
paying the rent persistently late, the Landlord requested an order for eviction and an order
for the Tenant
to pay the $186.00 application filing fee.
 
8.     Since the Tenant did not appear at the hearing, I did
not have the opportunity to receive submissions from them on any circumstances that might be relevant to my determination under s. 83(2)
of the Act. The Landlord indicated that they were not aware of
any reason to delay or deny
terminating the tenancy pursuant to subsection 83 of the Act.
 
9.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of January
31, 2022. The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before January 31 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$1,742.73, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from October 1, 2021
to January 20, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit. The Landlord shall also subtract any payments made by the
Tenant to the Landlord during this period.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$21.37 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from January 21, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
January 31, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 31, 2022, then starting
February 1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 1, 2022.
