Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: CEL-82854-19
 











 
 

M.R (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict V.M and T.H (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Mississauga
on February 27, 2019.
 
The Landlord’s Agent,
his son D and the Tenant T.H on behalf of both Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from January 1,
2019 to February 28, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a
Notice of Termination effective January 18, 2019.
2.     
The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit. 
3.     
The monthly rent is $1175.00.
4.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,125.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from November 4, 2013 to January 18,
2019. 
6.     
The Tenants paid $1,175.50
after the application was filed.
7.     
It appears that the arrears
arose in connection with the Tenant’s mistaken belief that he could deduct the
entire replacement cost of the bed from the lawful rent.  This issue is
discussed further below.
8.     
It is not disputed that the
Tenant attempted to pay $550.00 on January 17, 2019 but this amount came back
NSF.
9.     
It is not disputed that the
Tenant then offered to pay the Landlord cash to replace the cheque but they were
unable to meet prior to the hearing date in order for this payment to be made.
10.   Based on the testimony of the parties, I am
satisfied that each party bears some responsibility for the issues between
them.  By his own admission, the Landlord’s son was upset that Tenant refused
to assist him with readying the rental unit for repair after the flooding and
the Tenant acknowledged that he felt badly about the verbal altercation and
offered to apologize but by then the Landlord had filed the L1.  
11.   Under these circumstances and in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), I find
that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act
          Section
82
12.   At the hearing the Tenant raised issues pursuant
to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').
                      Tenant’s
evidence
 
13.   The Tenant
acknowledged that he owes the Landlord rent and also that he only made a
partial payment for the month of January.  
 
14.   He
explained that he attempted to pay the Landlord in cash during the month of
January, however, the timing did not work.  He is prepared to pay the rent he
owes but is upset that his daughter’s bed was damaged. 
 
15.   The Tenant
produced photographs which show a white child’s bedframe with a significant
crack. The Tenant alleges the Landlord son caused the crack to the bedframe
while moving it during the flood repair.
 
16.   The Tenant
did not dispute the Landlord’s son’s characterization of the Tenants’ as
unhelpful.  Nor did the Tenant dispute the characterization of the Landlord’s
son that the Tenants simply sat in the living room and refused to help when
asked them to assist with removing the furniture in the room. The Tenant
testified that it is the Landlord’s responsibility to repair damage caused by
flooding.
 
Landlord’s evidence
 
17.   The Landlord
did not attend the hearing, his son did it in his place. He explained that he
was responsible for resolving the flooding issue that occurred in the rental unit
last Christmas season.
 
18.   The Landlord’s
son explained that he was notified by the Tenants of the flood in their unit around
December 29. He testified that when he arrived at the rental unit the Tenants
did not cooperate with his efforts to resolve the flooding issue and instead
stayed in the other room and offered him no assistance. He testified that he
did in fact move the furniture in the affected bedroom, which is the bedroom
occupied by the Tenants’ small child.
 
19.   He conceded
that he and the Tenant had had several arguments following the flood, and that
he was frustrated by what he perceived to be the Tenants’ unwillingness to
assist him.  
 
Analysis
 
20.   I find
that it is more likely than not that the Landlord’s son inadvertently caused
damage to the bedframe while attempting to move it so that he could install
dehumidifiers.  
 
21.   The Tenant
is correct that it is the Landlord’s responsibility to repair damage caused by
flooding. However, section 16 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act) also
requires parties to take reasonable steps to minimize
their losses. In this case, it was unreasonable for the Tenant to leave simply
the bedframe in a flooded area and there is no reason that the Tenant could not
have assisted by ensuring that his and his family’s belongings were safely
removed.  
 
22.   The Tenant
produced a receipt for purchase of a replacement bed from Pottery Barn in the
amount of $550.00. Having regard to the lack of evidence before me that the
bedframe could not be repaired, the age of the bed and the Tenant’s failure to
minimize the damages, I find the Tenants are entitled to be compensate for 50%
of the replacement cost ($275.00). This amount shall be deducted from the
arrears of rent owing by the Tenants.
 
It is ordered that:
 

The Landlord’s application for eviction
     of the Tenants is denied on the condition that the Tenants pay the
     Landlord the application filing fee and arrears of rent to March 31, 2019
     of $2250.00 as follows:

 



Date Payment Due


Amount of Payment




April 15, 2019


$562.25
(costs
  + arrears)




May 15, 2019


$562.25
(
  arrears)




June 15, 2019


$562.25
(arrears)




July 15, 2019


$563.25
(arrears)



 

The Tenants
     shall also pay the Landlord the rent for the months of April 2019 to July
     2019 in full, and on the first day of each corresponding month.  

3.    If the Tenants fails to make any of the payments in accordance with
paragraphs 1 or 2, and by the dates required, then:
a.       
The Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenant, and for the payment of any new arrears of rent and NSF
charges not already ordered under paragraph 1 of this order. The Landlord must
make the application within 30 days of a breach of a condition set out in
paragraphs 1 or 2 of this order. 
b.       
The balance owing under paragraph 1 of this
order shall become payable on the day following the date of default. The monies
owing shall bear interest at the post-judgment interest rate determined under
subsection 207(7) of the Act.
4.   
If the Tenants have already paid March rent the amount
paid may be deducted from the amounts due on June 15 and July 15, 2019.
