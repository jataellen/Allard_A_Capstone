Order under
Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number:
HOL-12841-22




In the
matter of:


27, 3200 SINGLETON AVENUE LONDON ON N6L0C7


 




Between:


Rajeev Dhiman


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Nathaniel Annan


Tenant



 
On December 29, 2021, Rajeev
Dhiman (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Nathaniel
Annan (the 'Tenant')
and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on
December 24, 2021 with respect to application HOL-10969-21 RV.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenant
failed to pay to the Landlord $1,000.00
on or before December 15, 2021
towards December rent, as the cheque tendered by the Tenant was returned for
insufficient funds.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$12,000.00 for rent arrears in Order HOL-10969-21 RV. The amount that is still owing from that order is $12,000.00 and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous order HOL-10969-21 RV is
cancelled.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,000.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from February 20, 2019
to January 19, 2022.

It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order HOL-10969-21 RV is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 30, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$11,977.00*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to December 31, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes
on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $32.88
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
30, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 31, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 30, 2022, then starting
January 31, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant
possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 31, 2022.
