Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number:
NOL-44111-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
214, 49 ST. MARY'S RIVER
DRIVE SAULT STE. MARIE ON P6A6G9


 




Between:


Sault Ste Marie Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Katherine Chevrier-Erdman


Tenant



 
 
 
Sault Ste Marie Housing Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Katherine Chevrier-Erdman (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 13, 2022. Only the Landlord’s representative, Cathy Soby, attended
the hearing. As of 2:39 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
23, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent is $694.23.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $2,095.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the
parties and whether the Landlord
attempted to negotiate
a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.

It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order

February 6, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,339.41*, which represents the amount of rent

the unit starting January 27, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the

2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 6, 2022, then starting

vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 7, 2022.

i)               
$1,626.23 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$2,320.46 if the payment
is made on or before
February 6, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 7, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
