Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12434-21
 
 
In the matter of:      11 VITANNA ROAD
MARKHAM ON L6C0J4
 




Between:                  Sze Wai Cheng Kelvin Cheung


Landlords




 
 
and
 




Giovanni Nequia Shawna Brown


Tenants




 
 
Sze Wai Cheng and Kelvin Cheung
(the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Giovanni Nequia and Shawna Brown (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did
not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 1, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Bita Di Lisi, attended the hearing.
As of 3:32 p.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from January 1, 2020 to February
28, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective October 22, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $3,200.00.
 
4.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $3,200.00 from the Tenants and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from July 1, 2019 to
October 22, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
7.     The Board’s monetary jurisdiction is $35,000. At the
commencement of the hearing I asked whether the Landlord is aware of this limit
and if the excess owed is waived.
The Landlord confirmed that the excess owed to the Landlord is being
waived.




 
8.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of
the rental unit on or before
February 18, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $35,000.00*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 7, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before February
18, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 19, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 18, 2022, then starting
February 19, 2022, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 19, 2022.
 
7.    
If, on or before February 18,
2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $44,636.00** to the Landlords or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
8.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 19, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during
the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
