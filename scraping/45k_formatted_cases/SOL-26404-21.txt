Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26404-21
 
 
In the matter of:      32 NIAGARA STREET
HAMILTON ON L8L6A2
 
Between:                  Mike Waters                                    Landlord
 
 
and
 




Sean Bakhuis Tanya Turner


Tenants




 
 
 
Mike Waters (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Tanya Turner and Sean Bakhuis (the 'Tenants')
and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants
failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on
October 26, 2021 with respect to application SOL-22822-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenants have not met the following
conditions specified in the order:
The Tenants did not pay
$500.00 (arrears) on or before
November 5, 2021 and did not pay
$1480.00 (rent) in full on or before November
1, 2021.
 
3.       
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenants were ordered to pay
$7,622.86 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application
fee in Order SOL-22822-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $7,102.86 and that amount
is included in this
order. As a result, the previous
order SOL-22822-21 is cancelled.
 
5.       
Since the date of the order,
the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from January 11, 2021 to January 31, 2022.




 
6.       
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,000.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from September
1, 2018 to January 4, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
SOL-22822-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 15, 2022.
 
3.       
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $8,786.44*. (less any payments made by the Tenant after
this application was filed on November 9, 2021). This amount represents the rent owing up to January 4, 2022 and the costs related to
the application fee for the previous application, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.       
The Tenants shall also
pay to the Landlord $48.66
per day for compensation
for the use of the unit starting January 5, 2022 to the date the
Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.       
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
15, 2022, the Tenants will
start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 16, 2022.

The tenant has until January 14, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 77(6) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 14, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on July 16, 2022 if the order has not been
filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that
has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
