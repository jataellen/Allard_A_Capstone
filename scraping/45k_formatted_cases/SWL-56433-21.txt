Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-56433-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


27 FOUNDRY ST LEAMINGTON ON N8H1C2


 




Between:


Elena Abreu


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Tiffany
Bickford


Tenant



 
 
Elena Abreu (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tiffany
Bickford (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord has entered into an Agreement of
Purchase and Sale of the rental unit and the purchaser requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after
the termination date.
 
This hearing was
held by videoconference on December 20, 2021.
The Landlord and the Landlord’s representative, Connor Laino, were present at the hearing.
The Tenant was also
present at the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
On July 27, 2021 the
Landlord served the Tenant with an N12 Notice of Termination (N12) with a
termination date of September 30, 2021. The
N12 seeks termination of the tenancy on the ground that the purchaser of the rental
unit requires possession of the unit for the
purpose of residential occupation.
 
2.    
The Landlord
applied to the Board to terminate this tenancy on September
17, 2021. The Landlord has not, within two years prior to filing this
application, given any other notice under section 48, 49 or 50 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the “Act”) in respect of the same or a different rental unit.
 
Good faith
 
3.    
The N12 was served
pursuant to section 49 of the Act. Section
49(1) requires that, in order to be successful in this application, the
Landlord must establish that at the time of the service of the N12 notice,
the purchaser required,
in good faith, the unit for
residential use.
 
4.    
In Feeney v. Noble, 1994 CanLII 10538 (ON SC), the Court held that the test of good faith is genuine intention to occupy
the premises and not the reasonableness of the




 
Landlord’s proposal. This principle was upheld in Salter v. Beljinac 2001
CanLII 40231 (ON SCDC), where
the Court held that the “good faith” requirement simply means that the Landlord
sincerely intends to occupy the rental unit. The Landlord may also have
additional motives for selecting a particular rental
unit, but this does not affect the good
faith of the Landlord’s notice.”
 
5.    
In the more recent case
of Fava v. Harrison, [2014] O.J No. 2678 ONSC 3352 (Ont.Div.Ct.) the
Court determined that while the motives of the Landlord are, per Salter,
“largely irrelevant”, the Board can consider the conduct and motives of the
Landlord to draw inferences as to whether
the Landlord desires,
in good faith to occupy the property.”
 
6.    
The Landlord’s
representative submitted that the purchaser, Travis Chorba, will be moving into
the unit at 27 Foundry Street in Leamington for his own residential occupation. The Landlord provided a signed affidavit
from the purchaser dated September 10, 2021, pursuant to s. 71.1 of the Act. In the affidavit the purchaser states that he signed an Agreement of Purchase and Sale of the unit with the Landlord on June
26, 2021, and declares that he requires
the rental unit, in good faith, for his
residence for a period of at least
one year after the purchase is complete.
 
7.    
The Landlord’s representative also submitted
that the completion date for
the Agreement of Purchase
and Sale has been amended
three times since its signing
on June 26, 2021, and that
the current completion date is January 7, 2022.
 
8.    
The Tenant testified
that she believes that the purchaser is unlikely to move into unit. The Tenant
stated that the purchaser has a history
of buying homes in the
area and then selling them quickly for a profit.
The Tenant acknowledged that during her conversations
with the purchaser, the purchaser did not discuss
his intentions with respect to the rental unit, or how long he intended to live
there. The Tenant did not provide
evidence that the purchaser would not move into the rental unit.
 
9.    
On the basis of the evidence
provided, I am satisfied that the purchaser genuinely intends to
use the rental unit for his
own primary residence. I find
that the purchaser in good faith
requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation.
 
Compensation
 
10.  Section
49.1 of the Act requires
a landlord to compensate a tenant in an amount
equal to one month’s
rent if the purchaser, in good faith,
requires the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation. Section 55.1 of the Act requires this
compensation to be paid no later than on
the termination date specified in the notice
of termination of the tenancy. In addition, subsection 83(4) of the Act
provides that no eviction order shall be issued in a proceeding regarding
a termination of a tenancy
for the purpose
of residential occupation unless the landlord has
complied with section 49.1 of the Act.
 
11.  The Landlord testified
that one month’s
rent compensation in the amount of $766.50
was paid to the Tenant on September 29, 2021 via cheque #059. The Landlord testified further that the
rent deposit and interest in the amount of $840.00 was also paid to the




 
Tenant on September 29, 2021 via cheque #058. The Tenant
confirmed that she received both cheques. The Landlord noted that the Tenant has no
rent arrears.
 
12.  I am satisfied that the Landlord
met her obligation to pay the Tenant compensation equal to one month’s rent in accordance
with section 49.1 of the Act.
 
Relief from Eviction
 
13.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) and find that
it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 28, 2022
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
14.  The Tenant testified that she is a single
mother, unemployed, with two young children. She noted that although her
current rental unit is not in good shape, there is a lack of affordable housing
in the area, and as a result, finding another rental unit is
difficult. The Tenant testified further that she would like to keep her children
in the same school for the
remainder of the school year; therefore, if she is evicted, a six-month delay
would be ideal. The Tenant stated
that she has looked for alternate rental units since the summer of 2021.
 
15.  I find that, although the purchaser in good
faith requires possession of the rental unit for his
residential occupation, postponing the Tenant’s eviction until February 28,
2022 will provide the Tenant, who is struggling financially, with more time to
secure a rental unit that is suitable for her family and financial constraints. I find that the short delay to the
completion of the Agreement of Purchase and Sale, as a result of this eviction
postponement, would not be unfair to the Landlord or the purchaser.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated on February
28, 2022. The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before February 28, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall continue
to pay the Landlord monthly
rent of $766.50 until the Tenant
vacates the rental unit.
 
3.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 28, 2022, then starting
March 1, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
4.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 1, 2022.
