Order under Section
31
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOT-07404-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


36 PATHWAY DRIVE BRAMPTON ON L6X0Z7


 




Between:


Thomas Christie


Tenant




 


 
and


 




 


Nirmala Sharma


Landlord



 
 
 
 
Thomas Christie (the 'Tenant')
applied for an order determining that Nirmala Sharma (the 'Landlords') harassed, obstructed,
coerced, threatened or interfered with the Tenant.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 14th,
2022.
 
The Tenant
and the Landlords attended the hearing. The Landlord was assisted
by her son, Lakesh Sharma.
 
Evidence
 
1.    
The Tenant moved into the unit December 1st, 2017. Rent for the unit was $1000.00
per month.
 
2.    
Prior to moving in, the Tenant paid 1st and last month’s
rent. He also pre-paid an additional 3 months rent in good faith
to the Landlord.
 
3.     The Tenant also paid a $500 security deposit. He
claims that the deposit was not returned when he vacated the unit at the end of April 2020. He is seeking
the deposit to be repaid as well as the interest on
the last 3 months rent for a total of $624.
 
4.    
The Landlord’s son testified on
her behalf. He testified that the security deposit was not returned because
there had been damage in the unit that was discovered after the Tenant had vacated that required $3000.00
of repairs. No receipts were provided to support this assertion, but the Landlord
did submit pictures
which detailed their
claim. The Landlord’s son
further testified that he was not aware
that he had to repay the interest on
the Tenant’s last month’s rent.
 
Determinations:




 
5.    
I
advised the tenant at the onset of the hearing that he filed a T2 application alleging that the
Landlord harassed, obstructed, coerced,
threatened, or interfered with the Tenant in violation of s. 23 of the Residential
Tenancies Act (the “Act”) and had only noted this allegation in his application. I requested the Tenant to
explain how the allegations would constitute harassment.
 
6.    
The Tenant
replied that he was never harassed but had been unsure as to what Board
form to use and how to properly fill it out.
 
7.    
Having heard
that submission, I advised the Tenant that I would make note of his submission and would hear his
evidence with respect to the allegation.
 
8.    
If an allegation under s. 23 of the Act is
proven by the Tenant, they may seek a remedy under s. 29.
 
9.    
I find that the Tenants application contains allegations with respect to an illegal
charge and an allegation that the Tenant was not paid interest on last
month’s rent.
 
10.  These allegations would
normally be included
in a T1 application, and remedies would
be sought under ss. 135 and 106(10) respectively.
 
11.  As such, I am not satisfied on a balance
of probabilities that the Landlords
harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with the Tenant
by not repaying these expenses.
 
12.  Section 185 of the Act states:
 
(1) An application shall be filed with the Board in the form approved by the Board, shall be accompanied by the prescribed information and shall be signed by the applicant.
 
13. 
The Tenant should have made his applications pursuant
to the sections in which he was seeking remedies for, namely ss. 135
and 106(10).
 
It is ordered that:
 
14.  The Tenant's application is dismissed.
