Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-76413-17
 










 
 
 

M.S.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict B.T.
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on January 25, 2017.
 
The Landlord’s daughter, Sonia Sharif, the Tenant, and the
Tenant’s representative, P.M., attended the hearing. At the hearing, the
Landlord’s daughter provided written authorization permitting her to act on the
Landlord’s behalf. 
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from November 1, 2016 to January 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective January 3, 2017.
2.     
The arrears of rent owing for the period ending January 31, 2017, total
$4,000.00.
 
3.     
The Landlord incurred costs as a result of filing the application
in the amount of $170.00 and is entitled to reimbursement for those costs. 
 
4.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $2,000.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from November 29,
2015 to January 3, 2017, in the amount of $43.07.
6.      The
Tenant paid $2,000.00 after the application was filed.
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 22,
2017, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
8.      The rental
unit is a 4 bedroom house where the Tenant lives with her two adult sons. One
of the Tenant’s sons recently lost his job and is currently not making any
income, and the second son is employed but only making a minimal income. 
9.      It became
clear to the Tenant at the hearing that she cannot afford the rental unit. The
monthly rent is $2,000.00, the Tenant’s other monthly expenses total $1,677.00
and she has a monthly income of $3,000.00. 
10.   The Tenant
understands that she needs to move out of the rental unit, but she is seeking
relief in the form of a 6 week delay of eviction. The Tenant is a senior
citizen and has a minor physical disability.  
11.   The
Landlord’s daughter says that the Landlord has experienced financial hardship
as a result of the Tenant’s inability to pay the monthly rent for the last few
months. The Landlord is seeking a standard order which would see the Tenant
evicted within 11 days from the date of this order. 
12.   Based on
the Tenant’s inability to afford the rental unit, as well as the extensive
arrears I find it would not be unfair to delay the eviction by two weeks until
February 21, 2017.  
It
is ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before February 21, 2017.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,534.93*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to January 27, 2017, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $65.75 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting January 28, 2017 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $170.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
February 7, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from February 8, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 21, 2017, then starting February
22, 2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 22,
2017.
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $4,170.00 if the payment is made on or before January 31, 2017, or
ii)       $6,170.00 if the payment is made on or before February 21, 2017**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 22, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
