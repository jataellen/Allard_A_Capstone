Tenant




 


and


 




 


Simranjeet Singh


Landlord



 
Amish Bhavsar (the 'Tenant') applied for an order determining that Simranjeet Singh (the
'Landlord') has collected or retained money illegally.
This application was heard via video/teleconference on October 21, 2021.
 
Preliminary matters:
The hearing was initially
called at 10:45 a.m. and only the Tenant was in attendance. The Tenant
stated that they had spoken with a Duty Counsel representative in advance of
the hearing.
 
I proceeded as an uncontested
matter and heard the Tenant’s testimony and reviewed the documents submitted
by the Tenant that the Tenant was relying on in support
of the application.
 
Later in the hearing
block at approximately 1:03 p.m the Landlord
entered the hearing room and asserted that due to technical
difficulties he was unable to connect with the hearing earlier.
 
I reviewed with the Landlord the Tenants’ submissions and asked the Landlord to provide his testimony in response.
 
Background and Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant makes this application for return of his rent deposit under
subsection 135(1) of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006.
 
2.    
Section 135 of the Act states:
“a tenant or former tenant of a rental unit may apply to the Board for an order
that the landlord
pay to the tenant any money collected or retained in contravention of this Act …”
 
3.     For the reasons
that follow, the Tenant’s application is dismissed.
 
4.     On March 8, 2019, the Tenant attended at and viewed the rental unit with the Landlord
that the Landlord had advertised for rent.




 
5.    
It was the Landlord’s assertion that at all times the rental
unit was only available to rent
for a 12-month fixed term.
 
6.     The Tenant expressed
an interest in renting the unit with occupancy for April 1, 2019.
 
7.     The monthly rent for the rental unit was
$1,800.00.
 
8.     On March 9, 2019, the Tenant paid $200.00 to the Landlord
as a deposit to secure the
unit.
 
9.     On March 10, 2019, the Tenant texted the Landlord
and asked that a condition
be placed in the tenancy
agreement that should the Tenant find employment outside the area and/or
purchase a home that the Tenant would be able to terminate the one year term early.
 
10.  On March 10, 2019, the Landlord replied
to the Tenant that he was willing
to work something out with the
Tenant should those circumstances arise.
 
11.  It was the Landlords’
testimony that they met at the Landlord’s place of business and he agreed with the Tenant
to reduce the fixed term lease agreement from 12-months to six-
months.
 
12.  On March 10, 2019 the Tenant paid the Landlord
an additional $1,800.00, representing the balance of the rent for the rental unit.
 
13.  It wasn’t until
March 29, 2019,
that the Tenant
notified the Landlord
he was “withdrawing from the rental agreement” and requested the
return of his $2,000.00 rent deposit.
 
14.  The Landlord testified that the rental
unit was ready
for vacant possession on April 1, 2019, and the Tenant simply changed his
mind and did not move into the unit.
 
15.  The Landlord testified that he immediately advertised the rental
unit for rent and was only
able to obtain a new tenant for May; he lost one month of rent due to the
Tenant’s breach.
 
16.  Based on the evidence before me, I am satisfied on a balance
of probabilities that the
parties entered into a valid tenancy agreement and that the Tenant’s rental
unit was ready and available for occupancy on April 1, 2019.
 
17.  I prefer the Landlord’s evidence that he agreed to
work with the Tenant by reducing the term of the tenancy agreement
to 6-months from 12-months. I find this was a reasonable
resolution.
 
18.  Subsection 37(1) of the Act states that a tenancy may
be terminated only in accordance with the Act. In order for a tenant to
terminate a tenancy under the Act he or she must provide proper notice. The Tenants did not provide
the Landlord with a notice
to terminate the tenancy in
accordance with the Act.




 
 
19.  Section 88 of the Act states that where a tenant
abandons a tenancy without giving proper notice, the tenant is liable for the
rent for the period of notice the Tenant could have given to the landlord to properly terminate
the tenancy. In this case the Tenant was potentially liable
for rent for the period
of April 1, 2019 up to and including May 31, 2019.
 
20.  Section 16 of the Act states: “Where a landlord or a
tenant becomes liable to pay any amount as a result of a breach of a tenancy
agreement, the person entitled to claim the amount has a duty to take reasonable
steps to minimize the person’s losses.”
 
21.  I was satisfied that the Landlord undertook best
efforts to minimize his losses and re- rented
the unit as soon as he was able as at May 1, 2019 minimizing the Tenants liability.
 
22.  The Landlord collected an initial $200.00
rent deposit from the Tenant
and subsequently an
additional $1,800.00 representing a last month rent deposit.
 
23.  I find that by failing to take possession and move
into the rental unit on April 1,
2019, the Tenants became liable
for the rent until the tenancy was terminated or the rental
unit was re-rented to other
tenants.
 
24.  Therefore, the Landlord
is not required to return the deposit and can apply it to the rent owing.
 
25.  Based on the above, I do not find that the Landlord
collected or retained
the Tenant’s deposit in
contravention of the Act.
 
26.  As the Tenant
is not entitled to a refund of his rent deposit and the application must be dismissed.
 
27.  The order contains
all the reasons
for the decision within the order. No other reasons
will be issued.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant’s application is dismissed.
