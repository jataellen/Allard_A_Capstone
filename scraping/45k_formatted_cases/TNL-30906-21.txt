File Number: TNL-30906-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


706, 6210 YONGE
STREET TORONTO ON M2M3X5


 




Between:


Better Living
Homes Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Marjorie Base Shannen Base


Tenants



 
 
 
Better Living Homes Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order requiring Shannen Base and Marjorie Base (the 'Tenants') to pay
the rent that they owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on November
8, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s representative, S. Ursino, and the Tenants
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants were in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
2.     On January 31, 2021, the Tenants gave notice to terminate the tenancy on February 28, 2021. The Tenants did not give at
least 60 days’ notice. The Tenants
moved out on February 25, 2021.
 
3.     Pursuant to section 88 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), the Landlord claimed rent for March 2021 The only
issue is whether the Landlord took reasonable steps to minimize their
loss. I am satisfied that the Landlord
took reasonable steps to re-
rent the rental unit to minimize their loss.
The Landlord advertised the unit on websites such as Kijiji, PadMapper,
and Zumper. Even after reducing the rent, the Landlord was unable to re-rent
the unit until August 2021 because of the pandemic.
 
4.     The Tenants did not pay the total rent they were required
to pay for the period from
February 1, 2021 to March 31, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$1,635.20, which represents the amount of rent
owing up to March 31, 2021.




File Number: TNL-30906-21
 
2.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the
Landlord $201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February 4, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 5,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
