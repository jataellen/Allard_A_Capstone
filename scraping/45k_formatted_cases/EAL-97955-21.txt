Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number: EAL-97955-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
131, 2660 NORBERRY CRESCENT OTTAWA ON K1V6N2


 




Between:


Norberry Residences


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Barbara Gold


Tenant



 
 
 
Norberry Residences (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Barbara Gold (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 18, 2022. The Landlord's Legal Representative, Charlie
Bobrowsky, and the Tenant attended
the hearing. The Tenant declined the opportunity to speak with
Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
22, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the lawful monthly
rent is $1,234.77.
 
4.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,220.15 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021 to January 2, 2022.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $2,400.00 after
the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would
be unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The parties
agreed to a termination date of January 31, 2022.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before January 31,
2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $1,730.57*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
20, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $40.60
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 21, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
31, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 31, 2022, then starting
February 1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 1, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before January 31, 2022, the Tenant pays the
amount of $3,601.29** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for
eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
