Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-03811-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


6 ASHBURTON CRESCENT ANGUS ON L0M1B0


 




Between:


Felicia Leisk
  Philip Leisk


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Jamie Beauvais-Grant
  Kevin Beauvais-Grant


Tenants



 
 
 
Felicia Leisk and Philip
Leisk (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kevin Beauvais-grant and Jamie
Beauvais-grant (the 'Tenants') because they have been persistently late in
paying their rent
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on February
24, 2022. The Landlord,
represented by Eril Bregu, and the Tenant Kevin Beauvais-Grant, attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The
Landlord claims that rent is due on the 1st day of each month.
The Tenant testified that the tenancy agreement shows
that rent is due on or before the 7th day of
each month.
 
2.     The
tenancy agreement was reviewed at the hearing
and I find that the rent is due on the
7th day of each month. The ledger that supports the N8 notice for
persistently late payment of rent shows that the Tenants have been paying the
rent before the 7th day of the month.
 
3.     I find the Tenants have not been persistently late paying rent.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlords' application is dismissed.
