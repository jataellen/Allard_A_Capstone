Order under Section 21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-86427-17-RV
 










 
 

Review Order
 
M.Z
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict R.S
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was resolved by order TSL-86427-17 issued on September 1, 2017.
 
On
September 7, 2017, the Tenant requested a review of the order. A review hearing
was scheduled for October 26, 2017.  When the Landlord and his legal
representative appeared, the Tenant had not arrived by 10:10.  The Tenant did
attend for the hearing later in the day, but the Landlord and his legal
representative had left.  The hearing was ordered reconvened.
 
The
request of review was heard in Toronto on November 30, 2017.
 
The Landlord and his legal representative, O.P, and the Tenant
attended the hearing. A. K attended as a witness.
 
Determinations:
 
Request for Review
1.     
The Tenant testified he has serious chronic health conditions,
which caused his to miss the original hearing date of the application on August
28, 2017 and the original hearing date for the review on October 26, 2017.  He
says that his condition causes high fevers to suddenly come on which disable
him. He also testified that he has always been interested to defend the
application as he disputes the amount of money he owes the Landlord.  The
Tenant submitted a doctor’s note in relation to August 28, 2017 confirming that
he had a worsening medical condition.
2.     
The Board’s records show that the Tenant did telephone the Board
in the morning of October 26, 2017 to say he was very sick, but the message
came too late to be spoken to in the hearing.  
3.     
Landlord submits that the Tenant knew of the dates of hearing and
could have called to let the Landlord and/or the Board that he was too ill to
attend and that the request to review should be denied. 
4.     
For the reasons given at the hearing, I find that the Tenant was
not reasonably able to participate and the request for review is granted.
L1/L9
5.     
The lawful monthly rent for the
unit is $500.00 and is due on or before the first day of each month.
6.     
The Landlord’s application and update claims arrears for the
period from April 1, 2017 to November 30, 2017 in the amount of $2,980.00.  The
Landlord has given credit to the Tenant for $1,020.00 in payments during that
period.  The Landlord was unable to provide any rent ledger or other documents
to corroborate the rent owing.  The Landlord acknowledged that rent is received
in cash.  
7.     
The Tenant testified that he has paid his rent in cash each month,
but does not receive any receipts.  He says that he delivers the rent in cash
to the Landlord who is often intoxicated when the rent cash is delivered to him. 
The Tenant concedes that he made short payments in August, September, and October,
and owes the Landlord $480.00.  The Tenant says he paid rent in April, May and
June.  
8.     
The Tenant testified the Landlord started to bring applications
against all the tenants in the house because there were some tenants that were
paying no rent.  He testified that he has been paying faithfully, but that the
Landlord is confused because of his drinking and lack of records.  The Tenant
also testified that he began to have difficulties in paying the rent because
someone stole his phone and he ended up with a very high bill to pay off that
impacted his ability to pay rent in the fall.
9.     
The witness for the Tenant, AK, testified that he had also lived
in the same house as the Tenant for a period of time, and did observe the
Tenant paying cash to the Landlord last January.  AK also testified that he too
had paid rent in cash, but never received receipts from the Landlord.  
10.   The
Landlord testified but was unable to answer the questions he was asked by his
legal representative in a clear or consistent way.  He described himself as
very forgetful.
11.   I
find, on a balance of probabilities, the Tenant owes the Landlord $980.00 to
November 30, 2017, being the arrears that accumulated from August to October,
2017 and November’s rent.
12.   The
Tenant testified that he is receiving ODSP and lives alone.  He says he will be
able to pay $480.00 and keep current with his regular rent over a period of two
months.  
13.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) and find
that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) because of the Tenant’s chronic health problems, and because
the Tenant appears sincere in his desire to pay the arrears off and maintain
the tenancy.  
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Order
TSL-86427-17 issued on September 1, 2017 is cancelled and replaced by the
following: 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay the Landlord $980.00 in arrears of rent.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay the Landlord the cost of the application filing fee in
the amount of $175.00. 
4.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord the total amount of $1,155.00 as follows:
a)  On or
before February 15, 2018, the sum of $300.00;
b)  On or
before March 15, 2018, the sum of $300.00
c)   On
or before April 15, 2018, the sum of $300.00;
d)  On or
before May 15, 2018, the sum of $255.00.
5.      The
Tenant shall also pay the Landlord monthly rent owing on or before the first
day of each month commencing February 1, 2018 and continuing thereafter until
and including December 1, 2018.
6.      If
the Tenant fails to make any one of the payments in paragraph four or five above,
the Landlord may collect the entire outstanding balance from the amount set out
in paragraph four immediately.  
7.      If
the Tenant fails to make any of the payments in paragraph four or five above,
the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Act, within 30 days of the
breach and without notice to the Tenant, for an order terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenant, and requiring the Tenant to pay any new arrears of
rent and NSF fees and related charges that become owing after November 30,
2017.
