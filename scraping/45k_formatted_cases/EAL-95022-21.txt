Tenants



 
 
 
Interrent C/o Clv Group 1 (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Corey Leith, Cleason Lewis and Marina Smith-Soro (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 11, 2022. Only the Landlord’s representative, Elena
Jacob, attended the hearing. As of 10:27am,
the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay
for the period from March 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective March 24, 2021.
 
2.     The
Tenants vacated the rental unit on July 31, 2021. The Tenants
were in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,849.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,849.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from June 29, 2020 to
March 24, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenants paid $2,616.00 after
the application was filed.




File Number: EAL-95022-21

that:

the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.

not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
