In the matter of:      LOWER, 232 MOUNT PLEASANT STREET
BRANTFORD ON N3T1V1
 
Between:                  Patrick Campbell                                    Landlord
 
 
and
 




Berniss Powless Ryan Powless


Tenants




 
 
Patrick Campbell (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Berniss Powless and Ryan Powless (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 11, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal
Representative, Jordan Nieuwhof, attended the hearing. As of 2:09 p.m., the
Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the
Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from March 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective March 31, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,250.00.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,250.00
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
1, 2021 to March 30, 2021.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the




 
Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 30, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$12,107.08*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 19, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $41.10
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 20, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
30, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 31,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 30, 2022, then starting
January 31, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 31, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before January 30, 2022, the Tenants pay the
amount of $13,936.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after January
31, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
