Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-34932-21
 
 
 
 



In the matter
of:


39
  WARFIELD DRIVE NORTH YORK ON M2J3S4


 




Between:


Weiping Li Tiejun
Tang


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Mamoon Ashraf


Tenant



 
 
Weiping Li and Tiejun
Tang (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Mamoon Ashraf (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 17, 2022.
 
Only the Landlords’ Legal
Representative A. Chan attended the hearing. As of 10:30 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this
hearing by the Board. Upon review of the file, it is noted that the Tenant was
served with the Notice of Hearing by the Board on November 1, 2021 by both
regular mail and by email.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
July 7, 2021 to February
6, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords
served a Notice of Termination.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $570.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $550.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlords.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 8, 2018 to September 26, 2021.




 
7.    
The Landlord seeks a termination
of the tenancy by way of standard 11 day voidable order as the arrears are
substantial and the Tenant has made no payments since the application was
filed. The Landlord testified that they have attempted to resolve the matter
and negotiate a settlement with the Tenant,
but the Tenant has been unresponsive
to the settlement attempts. The Landlord testified that they are not aware of
any circumstances that would cause me to delay or deny a termination of the
tenancy. The Tenant did not attend the hearing to give evidence of their
circumstances.
 
8.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords
and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 4, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $3,173.67*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to
January 24, 2022, less the rent deposit
and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$18.74 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 25, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before
February 4, 2022, the Tenant will
start to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from February 5, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 4, 2022, then starting February
5, 2022, the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 5, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 4, 2022, the Tenant pays the
amount of $4,176.00** to the Landlords or to the Board in trust, this order for
eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could
remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time,
the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 5, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The




 
Tenant is only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
