rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in

The lawful monthly rent is $1,908.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant paid $19,200.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,908.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period from June 26, 2020 to October 28, 2020.




File Number: SOL-25699-21
 
It is ordered that:

the full amount
owing* on or before March
