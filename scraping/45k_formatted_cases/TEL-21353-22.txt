Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-21353-22
 



In the
  matter of:


20 SHERBOURNE STREET
NORTH BANCROFT ON K0L1C0


 




Between:


Andrew Peel


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Tom Purtell


Tenant



 
 
On January 18, 2022, Andrew Peel
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tom
Purtell (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the
Tenant owes because the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board
on November 30, 2021 with respect to application TEL-18810-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.    
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed to pay to the Landlord
$1,200.00 on or before January
2, 2022 towards the balance
of the arrears of rent and costs.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$2,901.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order TEL-18810-21. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $1,201.00 and that amount
is included in this order. As a result, the previous order TEL-18810-21 is
cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order,
the Tenant has also failed
to pay the full rent that
became owing for the period from December 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TEL-18810-21 is cancelled.

2.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 11, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
pay to the Landlord $2,751.00*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 31, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $41.10 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 11, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
February 12, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 11, 2022, then starting February
12, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 12, 2022.

The tenant has until February 10, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by February 10, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on August 12, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
