Order under
Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number:
SWL-57385-21




 
In the matter
  of:


 
604, 746 FANSHAWE PARK ROAD N LONDON ON N5X2M5


 




Between:


Homestead Land
Holdings Limited


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Alisa Posthumus


Tenant



 
 
 
Homestead Land Holdings Limited
(the 'Landlord') applied in this L4 application for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Alisa Posthumus (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the
Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the consent order issued by the Board on October
28, 2021 with respect
to L1 application SWL- 53191-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The consent order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the consent
order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following conditions specified in the consent
order:
The Tenant did not pay $400.00
on or before November 20, 2021 and did not pay
$1199.00 rent on or before December
1, 2021.
 
3.       
The previous L1 application included a request
for an order for the payment
of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the
Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in
addition to eviction, in this L4 application the Landlord is entitled to
request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$5,031.06 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application
fee in consent Order SWL-53191-21. The Tenant made no payments so the amount
that is still
owing from that order is $5,031.06, which is included in this order. As a result, the
previous consent order SWL-53191-21 is cancelled.
 
5.       
Since the date of the consent
order, the Tenant
has failed to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from November
1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.




 
6.       
On December 17, 2020 the Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,199.00 from the
Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period from December
17, 2020 to January 11, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
Order SWL-53191-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January
22, 2022 (standard 11 days from the issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,029.62*. This amount represents the rent owing up to December 31, 2021 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$39.42 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 1, 2022 to
the date the Tenant actually moves out of the rental unit or gets evicted.
 
5.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
22, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 23, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 22, 2022, then starting January
23, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 23, 2022.
 
 
January 11, 2022

The tenant has until January 21, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 21, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on July 23, 2022 if the order has not been
filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that
has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
