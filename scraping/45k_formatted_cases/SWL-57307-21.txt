On November 18, 2021, Helena
Hammond, Jason Hammond, Kim Hammond and 2492226 Ontario Inc (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Daren
Brown (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent
the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the
order issued by the Board on July 8, 2021 with respect to application
SWL-49082-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The order provided that the
Landlords could apply to the Board
under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act') without
notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the
Tenant did not meet certain
condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition(s) specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed to pay to the Landlord
$395.00 on or before November
15, 2021 towards arrears of
rent.
 
3.       
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order
required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction,
the Landlords are entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$2,361.77 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application
fee in Order SWL-49082-21. The amount that is still owing from that order
is $747.77 and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous
order SWL-49082-21 is cancelled.
 
5.       
Since the date of the order, the Tenant has also failed to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from
November 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.




 
6.       
The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $720.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlords.
 
7.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenant for the period from August 1, 2016 to January 10, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
Order SWL-49082-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 21, 2022.
 
3.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $63.70*.
This amount represents the rent owing up
to November 30, 2021 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on
the rent deposit.
 
4.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords
$25.45 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting December 1, 2021
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before January
21, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 21, 2022, then starting January
22, 2022, the Landlords may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after January 22, 2022.

The tenant has until January 20, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 20, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on July 22, 2022 if the order has not been
filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that
has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
