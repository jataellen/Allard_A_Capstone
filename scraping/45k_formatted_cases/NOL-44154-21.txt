Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44154-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


5 BALLPARK ROAD CAPREOL ON P0M1H0


 




Between:


Jennifer Fournier


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Evan Pomerleau
  Kayla Krystia


Tenants



 
 
 
Jennifer
Fournier (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Kayla Krystia and Evan Pomerleau (the 'Tenants') because
they, another occupant
of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the
residential complex have wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the
premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenants to
compensate the Landlord for the damage; because they, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant; and because they have
been persistently late in paying their rent. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 988 4914 7021# on January
10, 2022. The Landlord,
represented by Monique Laderoute, and The Tenants, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord served a
notice for persistently late payment of rent.
There are eight late payments identified since the Landlord purchased
the property in April 2019. The list
includes many payments two or three days late.
The Tenants have paid the rent in full and on time since
the notice was served in September. I find it would not be reasonable to terminate the tenancy under
the circumstances.
 
2.     The Landlord is also claiming
that the Tenants
are not keeping
the property in a well-kept manner. Photographs show that they are many personal items in the yard
including a pool, a structure for a slide, a play structure and ATV’s. The Landlord claims that a neighbour has complained and that the Tenants are in violation
by-laws with the pool and hot tub.




File Number: NOL-44154-21
 
3.    
The evidence
is insufficient for me to determine if the Tenants
are violating local by-laws.
The Board does not have jurisdiction over complaints from neighbours who do not reside
at the same residential complex.
 
4.    
I find there is insufficient evidence
to determine the Tenants have caused damage,
or substantially interfered with the Landlord’s lawful rights and
privileges.
 
5.    
At the hearing the
Landlord testified that she did not have key to the rental unit as required. The Tenants testified there is no key. There is a code to open the door which
they provided to the Landlord
at the hearing. The Tenants
also agreed to place their dog
in a container if the Landlord is required to enter the unit.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord's application is dismissed.
