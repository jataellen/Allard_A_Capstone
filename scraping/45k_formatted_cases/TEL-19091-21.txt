File Number: TEL-19091-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


80
  RAINIER SQUARE SCARBOROUGH ON M1T2Z9


 




Between:


Anand Aruldhas


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Deleth Allen
Horace Lloyd Brown


Tenants



 
 
 
Anand Aruldhas (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Horace Lloyd Brown and Deleth Allen (the 'Tenants') because
they, another occupant
of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the
residential complex have wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the
premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenants to
compensate the Landlord for the damage; because they, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant; and because the number
of persons living in the unit on a continuing basis is more than permitted by
health, safety or housing standards.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 956 0593 7653# on January
18, 2022. The Landlord
and the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants are to pay the utility
costs as a part of the tenancy
agreement. The Tenants have not paid any of these costs
since they moved into the home and the amount outstanding is currently
$7,558.36. The Tenants have also not
paid rent in four months and are $11,250.00 in arrears as of the date of the
hearing.
 
2.     The Tenants claim that the Landlord would not provide
them with the proof of the utility bills. The Tenants
also claim there are people living in the basement
using hydro which they are required to pay.
 
3.     The Landlord denies
these submissions. The Landlord testified
there is nobody
living in the basement.
 
4.     There is no evidence that there are people living in
the basement. Considering the amount of money the Tenants currently
owe the Landlord, I find the Landlord’s testimony




 
to be more
reliable. As such, I find the Tenants have substantially
interfered with the Landlord’s lawful
right and privilege
by not paying the utility
bills as required
since the inception of the
tenancy.
 
5.     The Landlord’s application also request compensation
for damage caused to the lawn where the Tenants
have been parking
their vehicles. The Landlord also testified that has
received fines totalling $230.92 on his property tax bill because of cars
parked on the front lawn. The
Tenant’s deny that they are parking on the lawn.
 
6.     Based on the photographs introduced by the Landlord
showing the lawn before the Tenants moved into the home and the condition when the application was filed, I find the Tenants have wilfully or negligently
cause damage to the front lawn. At
the hearing the Landlord withdrew the request for compensation.
 
7.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated, as of February
6, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 6, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
3.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February 6, 2022, they will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 7, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 6, 2022, then starting
February 7, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
5.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 7, 2022.
