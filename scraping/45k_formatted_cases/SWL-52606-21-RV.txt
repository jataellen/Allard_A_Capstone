Review Order
 
Good News
Community Homes (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Claressa Pleasant (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes; and has been persistently late in paying the rent.
 
This
application was resolved by order SWL-52606-21 issued on October 28, 2021,
amended on November 25, 2021 and December 23, 2021.
 
On December
22, 2021, the Tenant requested a review of the order and that the order be
stayed until the request to review the order is resolved.
 
On January 5,
2022, interim order SWL-52606-21 -IN was issued, staying the order issued on
October 28, 2021, amended on November 25, 2021 and December 23, 2021. The Tenant alleged that the order contains a serious
error.
 
The request
was heard by video conference on January 25, 2022. The Landlord's Legal
Representative, R. Rose, and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
The application is amended to reflect
the accurate street name of the rental
unit.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant alleged that order SWL-52606-21, amended on
November 25, 2021 contains a serious error. The Tenant indicated that there was
an error in the calculation of the outstanding amount she was ordered to pay to
the Landlord.
 
2.     At the hearing,
the Tenant sought
to include other claims she asserted resulted
in an error in order SWL-52606-21.
However, those claims were contained in an email to the Board




File Number: SWL-52606-21
 
that the Landlord was not privy to as they were not part of the Tenant’s Request
to Review an Order. As a
result, I could not consider those claims.
 
3.     The Tenant’s specific claim that she was erroneously
ordered to pay $14,834.00 on or before November
30, 2021 instead of $13,858.00, was accurate. However, that error was rectified
in the amended order issued on November 25, 2021.
 
4.    
The Tenant has no basis for seeking to further pursue this request.
 
5.     Based on the submissions made in the request, I am not
satisfied that there is a serious error in the order or that a serious error
occurred in the proceedings.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The request to review order SWL-52606-21 issued on
October 28, 2021, amended on November 25, 2021 and December 23, 2021, is
denied. The order is confirmed and remains unchanged.
 
2.     The interim order issued on January 5, 2022, is
cancelled. The stay of order SWL-52606-
21 is lifted immediately.
