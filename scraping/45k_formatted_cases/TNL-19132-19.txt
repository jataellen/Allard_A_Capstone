Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-19132-19
 











 
 
 

ZIL C/o BRPMI. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict HP (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has
been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination
date.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on December 13,
2019.
 
The Landlord’s legal
representative, DR, and the Tenant’s legal representative, IF, attended the
hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The Tenant did not attend the hearing.  His
legal representative said that he was out of the country caring for his father.
 
2.     
The Tenant has persistently
failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
3.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,221.60 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
 
4.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2019 to October 31, 2019.
 
5.     
The Landlord is seeking an
order for non-remedial termination.  The Landlord’s legal representative said
that the Landlord is concerned that the Tenant is not living in the rental
unit.  In addition, the Landlord’s legal representative said that the Landlord
has filed at least two applications for non-payment of rent since the end of
2018, and he added that the Tenant currently owes three months of arrears.
6.      The Tenant’s legal representative said that the
Tenant flies back and forth to his country of origin in order to care for his
ill father.  He also said that the Tenant’s cousins have been living in the
rental unit.
 
7.      The Tenant’s legal representative said that the
Tenant tried to pay the rent in December, 2019, but the Landlord refused to
take it.  He gave a money order in the amount of $1,221.60 to the Landlord’s
legal representative at the hearing.
 
8.      I find that the Landlord’s ledger demonstrates
that the Tenant has only made sporadic payments towards the rent throughout
2019.  The Landlord sought and obtained an order for arrears, TNL-16546-19,
which the Tenant voided in August, 2019.  Immediately after voiding the order
in August, the Tenant made no further payments towards the rent for four
months, until December, 2019, despite being served the N8 Notice of Termination
in August, 2019.
 
9.      The Tenant did not attend the hearing to give
evidence about his ability to pay the full rent, on time, going forward, nor to
testify about his intention to continue the tenancy.
 
10.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.  Despite voiding
the order in August, 2019, and despite making two payments towards rent arrears
in December, 2019, the Tenant still owes a substantial amount of arrears to the
Landlord.  There is no evidence to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that
the Tenant is able to pay the full rent, on time, going forward, nor that he
seeks to continue the tenancy.  Consequently, I find that the tenancy is no
longer viable, and it is prejudicial to the Landlord for the tenancy to
continue. 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated, as of January 26, 2020. The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before January 26, 2020.
 
2.     
If the Tenant does not move
out of the rental unit on or before January 26, 2020, the Tenant shall also pay
to the Landlord $40.16 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from
January 16, 2020 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing on or before January 26, 2020, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
January 27, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 26, 2020, then starting January 27, 2020, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after January 27, 2020.
