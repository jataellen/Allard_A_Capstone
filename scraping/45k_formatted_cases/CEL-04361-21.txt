Between:


Homestead Land Holdings Limited


Landlord

Moreen
Euphenia Thomas


Tenant



 
 
 
Homestead Land
Holdings Limited (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Moreen Euphenia Thomas
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant failed
to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on November 30, 2021 with respect to
application HOL-11642-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant
has not met the following condition specified in the order: the Tenant did not pay $21,965.46, on or before November 29, 2021. The Tenant provided the Landlord
a cheque dated
November 26, 2021;
however, the check
was inconsistent listing one
amount numerically and a different amount when written out. The Landlord
provided the Tenant with an opportunity to rectify the situation prior to
filing this application however the amount remained unpaid.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 25, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 25, 2022, then starting January
26, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.

Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 26, 2022.
