In the matter
of:


2, 2 GARY AVENUE HAMILTON ON L8S1Y3


 




Between:


Vijay Shah


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Abdul Hameed Yusuf
Abrahim


Tenant



 
 
 
Vijay Shah (the 'Landlord') applied for an order requiring Abdul Hameed Yusuf
Abrahim (the 'Tenant') to pay
the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in
video conference room 68 on June 11, 2021 and in video conference room 125 on December 15,
2021.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s
witness, Monica Rathee-Shah (‘MR’), the Tenant and the Tenant’s representative, Sarah Teal, attended
the hearing on June 11, 2021. The Landlord,
the Landlord’s witness MR and
the Tenant attended the hearing on December 15, 2021.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant was in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
2.    
Although the parties agreed
at the hearing that the Tenant
did not move-in to the rental
unit, physical occupancy of a rental unit is not required for a tenancy
agreement to take effect, per subsection 13(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). The
tenancy between the Landlord and Tenant therefore started on May 1, 2020.
 
3.    
On June 18, 2020, the Tenant
advised the Landlord
by email message
that he would not occupy the
rental unit. The Tenant cited the
COVID-19 pandemic and suspension of in- class learning at McMaster University
as among his reasons for deciding not to occupy the unit. The Tenant asked the Landlord to terminate the tenancy agreement before the April 30, 2021 fixed date.
 
4.     The Landlord’s witness
MR is the Landlord’s spouse
and acts as the Landlord’s property manager. MR agreed
at the hearing that she received the Tenant’s June 18, 2020 email
message. MR wrote back to the Tenant
on the same day to deny the request to terminate the tenancy before April 30,
2021. MR, however, offered the Tenant
three options in the alternative: to
find a suitable sub-tenant or assignee to assume the




 
Tenant’s tenancy agreement; to temporarily defer rental payments
with the understanding that the total amount would
become due and payable; or to continue paying the monthly at a 25 percent
reduced amount.
 
5.     The Tenant accepted MR’s first offer of ending his
obligations under the tenancy upon finding another person to occupy the rental
unit. The Tenant testified that he
collected the keys for the rental unit and residential complex
on July 27, 2020 to begin showing
the property to prospective sub-tenants or assignees. The Tenant estimated receiving 20
applications, which he forwarded to MR and the Landlord. MR testified that she also searched for prospective
sub-tenants/assignees by posting rental advertisements on McMaster University’s
student housing board.
 
6.    
The Tenant had previously applied
to the Board for an order determining that the Landlord unreasonably denied the
Tenant’s request to assign or sublet the rental unit. The Board dismissed the
Tenant’s application in Board Order SOT-17437-20, issued on May 19, 2021. In that order, the presiding adjudicator
determined that subsection 21(2) of the Human
Rights Code permits a landlord to restrict occupancy of rental units where a residential complex accommodates people
who are of the same sex.
 
7.     At the hearing for this current application
SOL-16095-20, the Tenant repeated his submission that the Landlord unreasonably
refused his request to sublet or assign the tenancy by restricting the
successful sub-tenant or assignee to a male student at McMaster University. The Tenant argued that the Landlord failed to mitigate
his losses.
 
8.     The Board’s May 19, 2021 Order SOT-17437-20 is a final
order that determines the Tenant’s claim that the Landlord unreasonably denied
the Tenant’s request to sublet or assign the rental unit. The Tenant’s attempt to revisit the issue
in this application represents an abuse of the Board’s process. The Tenant did not avail himself of the
Board’s procedures to review the May 19, 2021 order, or to
otherwise appeal the order. The evidence and submissions the
Tenant sought to introduce at the hearing in these proceedings should
have been raised in relation
to SOT-17437-20, either
at the hearing itself or in a request to review the May 19, 2021 order.
 
9.     I accordingly adopt the Board’s
conclusions in Order SOT-17437-20 and find that the
Landlord did not unreasonably withhold permission to sublet or assign the
tenancy.
 
10.  The Tenant gave evidence that he stopped searching for
a potential sub-tenant or assignee on October 7, 2020. MR gave evidence that she continued searching for a person to
occupy the rental unit but was unable to find a suitable successor-tenant. The Tenant returned the keys to the
Landlord on April 12,2021. The Tenant
testified that he had attempted to return the keys to the Landlord
earlier, on or about September 20, 2020. The
Landlord, however, was entitled to refuse ending the fixed-term tenancy on that
day.
 
11.  The Landlord seeks
rent arrears for the period
from July 1, 2020 to April 30, 2021. The Tenant paid a rent deposit of $500.00,
which deposit the Landlord is still holding and which amount is equal to
one month’s rent. The Tenant
testified that, in addition to the rent deposit, the Tenant paid rent for the
period May 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. The




 
Tenant’s evidence of the total amount he paid the Landlord
is consistent with the
Landlord’s evidence. The Tenant has
therefore not paid rent for 10 months.
 
12.  Based on the evidence, I find it is appropriate to
order the Tenant to pay rent arrears for the period ending April 30, 2021,
which was the last day of the fixed-term tenancy. The Landlord proved on a balance
of probabilities that he attempted to mitigate his losses by continuing to search for a
successor-tenant.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$4,500.00, which represents the amount of rent
owing up to April 30, 2021, less the Tenant’s rent deposit.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February
19, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 20, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
