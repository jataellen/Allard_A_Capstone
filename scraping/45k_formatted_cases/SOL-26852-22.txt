Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26852-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


2, 9 PERTH STREET SOUTH ST. CATHARINES ON L2P3C8


 




Between:


Edward Wayne
Quirk


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Edward Jackson
  Linda Jackson


Tenants



 
 
 
On January 24, 2022, Edward Wayne Quirk (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Linda Jackson and Edward Jackson (the 'Tenants')
because the Tenants entered into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord and the Tenants
signed an agreement
to terminate the tenancy as of March 31, 2022.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before March 31, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 31, 2022, then starting April 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to
the Landlord on or after April 1, 2022.
