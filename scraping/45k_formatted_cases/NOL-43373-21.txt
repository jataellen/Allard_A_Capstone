Marlene St Germain


Tenant



 
 
746487 Ontario Ltd O/a Plaza View
Apts (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Marlene
St Germain (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant or another occupant
of the rental unit has committed an illegal act or
has carried out, or permitted someone to carry out an illegal trade, business
or occupation in the rental unit or the residential complex involving the
production of an illegal drug, the trafficking in an illegal drug or the
possession of an illegal drug for the purposes of trafficking.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on October 25, 2021 at 9:42am.
 
Only the Landlord’s agent,
Fern Pereira, attended
the hearing. The Landlord was represented by Gary Bock.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
As of the hearing
date, the Tenant
is in possession of the rental unit. The lawful
monthly rent is $1,200.00.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s L2 application is based on a N6 notice
of termination served
to the Tenant on July 16, 2021 with a termination date of July 27,
2021 alleging the Tenant, their occupant or
someone they permitted, committed an illegal act on
the residential premises involving the production of an
illegal drug, the trafficking of an illegal drug and/or the possession of an
illegal drug for the purposes of trafficking.
 
Landlord’s Evidence
 
3.     The Landlord’s witness, Fern Pereira, who is the owner
of the numbered company listed as the Landlord for the past 30 years, testified that while she does not
live at the building and has not personally witnessed any drug transactions at
the rental unit, she received multiple complaints of heavy foot traffic at the
rental unit. Further, she testified that the Tenant is a known drug dealer and
user and advertises her business on Facebook; FP submits that at least three other long-term tenants
have moved out of their units because of the Tenant’s conduct.




File Number: NOL-43373-21
 
4.    
The Landlord submits that this
conduct exhibited by the Tenant’s occupant and/or someone they permitted to the rental
unit constitutes an illegal act –
specifically selling and using
drugs at the rental unit and seeks a termination of the tenancy and reimbursement
of the application filing fee.
 
ANALYSIS
 
5.     Section 61 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 states:
 
61 (1) A landlord
may give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy
if the tenant or another occupant of the rental unit commits an illegal
act or carries on an illegal trade, business or occupation or permits a person
to do so in the rental unit or the residential complex.
 
6.    
Based on the
evidence before the Board, I find the Landlord has failed to meet their burden
of proof in establishing the Tenant or someone they permitted has committed an
illegal act at the rental unit involving the production of an illegal drug, the
trafficking of an illegal drug and/or the possession of an illegal drug for the
purposes of trafficking. I say this as there was no first-hand evidence
of drug activity
taking place from inside the rental
unit or of witnessing a drug transaction from the rental unit.
 
7.    
Absent any other
evidence, I find that the Landlord’s case is speculative at best. I do not find that having heavy foot traffic
at the rental unit is indicative of illegal drug activity at the
rental unit; I also do not
find that multiple police attendances at the rental unit is indicative of illegal
drug activity. Finally, with respect to the incident from July 13, 2021, the
application before me does not deal with a serious impairment of safety.
 
8.     As a result,
the Landlord’s application must be dismissed.
 
9.    
This order contains all of the reasons for my decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.   











The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
