Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44177-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


3, 127 CENTRE STREET ESPANOLA ON P5E1S4


 




Between:


Ameesha Bindra


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Alicia Arnott Chris
Neville


Tenants



 
 
 
Ameesha Bindra (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Chris Neville and Alicia Arnott (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
13, 2022. Only the Landlord
attended the hearing. As of
1:55 p.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the
Tenants were required
to pay for the period from January 1, 2020 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective July 20, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $800.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.    
The Tenants paid $2,400.00
after the application was filed.
 
6.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it would
not be unfair to postpone the eviction until 30 days after the date of this order,
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. Given that the Tenants have been making monthly payments as they come due in recent months, this will
afford the Tenants additional time to void the order, should they elect to do
so.




File Number: NOL-44177-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 23, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$6,231.20*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 24, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $26.30
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 25, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
23, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 24, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 23, 2022, then starting
February 24, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 24, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$6,586.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$7,386.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 23, 2022**.
If the Tenants
do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 24, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
