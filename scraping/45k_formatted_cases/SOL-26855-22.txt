File Number: SOL-26855-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


LOWER LEVEL RM B3, 47 PELHAM ROAD ST. CATHARINES ON L2S1R3


 




Between:


Bushra Alam
  Haque
Mohammed Azimul Aka Azim Haque


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Alexa Hallet


Tenant



 
 
 
On January 24, 2022, Bushra Alam
Haque and Mohammed Azimul Aka Azim Haque (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Alexa Hallet (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant entered into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlords and the Tenant
signed an agreement to terminate the tenancy
as of February 28, 2022.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 28, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 28, 2022, then starting
March 1, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after March 1, 2022.

the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on September 1, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this
date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial
