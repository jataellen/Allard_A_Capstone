Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55971-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


2, 871 ADELAIDE STREET N LONDON ON
  N5Y2M2


 




Between:


2765749 Ontario Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Douglas Williams


Tenant



 
 
2765749 Ontario Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Douglas Williams (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 27, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Agent, James Fernandez, attended the hearing. As of 10:28 a.m.,
the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although properly
served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective October 16, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent is $820.95.
 
4.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $795.00
from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from January 1, 2021 to
January 16, 2022.
 
6.    
The Tenant paid $1,590.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 15, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $213.73*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
4, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$26.99 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 5, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 15, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 15, 2022, then starting February
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 16, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 15, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $1,892.78** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this
order for eviction will be void. This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if the Tenant pays the amount
required under that subsection on or after February 16, 2022 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to
make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
