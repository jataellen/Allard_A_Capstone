Order under
Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006


 




 


File Number: SWL-57551-22




 
In the matter
of:


 
305, 164 WISSLER ROAD WATERLOO ON N2K2T8


 




Between:


Killam Apartment Reit


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Matthew Ford


Tenant



 
 
 
Killam Apartment Reit (the 'Landlord') applied
in this L4 application for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict Matthew Ford (the
'Tenant') and for an order to have
the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the consent order issued by the Board
on September 9, 2021 with respect to L1 application SWL-52503-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The previous consent order
provided that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the
Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the consent order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following conditions specified in the consent order: The Tenant did not pay $400.00
arrears on or before December 25, 2021. The Tenant did not pay $1325.72 rent on
or before January 1, 2022. These were breaches
of paragraph 2 of the consent
order. This L4 application was filed
within 30 days of the breaches.
 
3.       
The previous L1 application included a request
for an order for the payment
of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the
Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in
addition to eviction, in this L4 application the Landlord is entitled to
request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$3,864.98 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in previous
consent order SWL-52503-21. The amount that is
still owing from that order is $1,754.98 and that amount is included in this
order. As a result, the previous order SWL-52503-21 is cancelled.
 
5.       
Since the date of the consent
order, the Tenant
has failed to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from December
1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.




 
6.       
On April 4, 2020 the Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,275.00 from the
Tenant and this deposit is
still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.       
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period
from April 4, 2020 to the
date of this order, January 25, 2022.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The previous consent order SWL-52503-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 5, 2022 (standard 11 days from the
issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
If the Tenant made any payments
to the Landlord after this L4 application was filed, those amounts shall be deducted from the
calculations below.
 
Refer to the attached
Summary of Calculations
 
4.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,654.65*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 31, 2022 and the costs
related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
5.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$43.59 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 1, 2022 to
the date the Tenant actually moves out of the rental unit or gets evicted.
 
6.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
5, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 6, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 5, 2022, then starting February
6, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 6, 2022.

stayed and the Board will schedule a hearing.
