Ademola Olaitan and Monsurat
Olaitan (the 'Tenants') applied for an order determining that Preston Apartments (the 'Landlord') has collected or
retained money illegally.
 
This application was heard via video conference on January 11, 2022.
The following people attended the hearing:
•        
The second-named Tenant;
•        
The Tenant’s legal representative, Dan McIntyre;
•        
The Landlord’s legal representative, Jeff Shabes;
•        
The Landlord’s property manager,
Chalina Nasser; and
•        
The Landlord’s witness, Lijana
Hysi.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
For the following reasons, we find
that the Tenants’ application should be granted. The facts are not
in dispute. The first-named Tenant, ‘AO’, has
a medically diagnosed fear of heights and he was not living
in Canada when his wife, the second-named Tenant, ‘MO’, began
looking for a rental unit for them both.
 
2.       
MO completed a rental application and, on
September 10, 2019, she viewed
a vacant unit on the 9th floor that had a similar floor plan to the unit that would
soon become available on the 20th floor. MO visited the complex within
the next two days to take a video of the rental unit to send to her husband. On
Friday, September 13, 2019, MO paid to the Landlord $4,300.00 for the first and
last month’s rent. The parties then discussed the requirement for the
Tenants to purchase insurance, but they agreed that was
not required until they moved in on
November 1, 2019.




 
3.       
On Friday, September 13, 2019, after showing the video to her husband,
MO and AO realized that the rental unit would be too high and would
aggravate AO’s medical condition. On that same day, MO attempted to contact the
Landlord to withdraw her application but the office was closed.
 
4.       
On Monday, September 16, 2019, MO
attended the rental office and handed the Landlord’s staff a handwritten letter
requesting that her rental application be cancelled and asking for her deposit
to be returned. This document was then forwarded to the Landlord’s head office staff for consideration and the word “cancelled” was written next to
the Tenant’s name on the Landlord’s log. The Landlord then began showing the
rental unit in early October to prospective tenants and the unit was rented out
with a move-in date of December 1, 2019.
 
5.       
Neither of the Tenants
received keys for the rental unit or took possession of the unit. No
tenancy agreement with the Landlord was ever signed.
 
6.       
Although the Landlord seems to say
that they were not aware of the Tenants’ intent to cancel their application until May 2020, this
suggestion is not supported by the
evidence. The Landlord’s property agent, LH, confirmed at the hearing that she
received MO’s handwritten letter of cancellation and she forwarded it to head
office. LH then made a note of this cancellation on her log and immediately began making attempts
to find a new
tenant. Although medical documentation of AO’s condition did not arrive to
Canada until May 2020, LH’s testimony and the documentary evidence confirm that
the Landlord was well aware of the Tenants’ cancellation by at least September
16, 2019.
 
7.       
As there was no lease
in place and the Tenants
did not have the keys or
take possession of the rental unit,
we find that a tenancy agreement was never entered into. The case of Benedetto v.
Dineen (September 8, 2005), Toronto
Docket No. 325/06,
2006 CarswellOnt 3233 stands
for the proposition that, where a tenancy agreement is not finalized, the
Tenants are entitled to the return of their deposit. We find that this
principle is applicable to the matter before us and we see no reason to depart
from it.
 
8.       
We would also note that the Landlord’s retention of this money is a breach of subsection 107(1) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') which says;
 
A landlord
shall repay the amount received
as a rent deposit in respect of a
rental unit if vacant possession of the rental unit is not given to the
prospective tenant.
 
9.       
As the Landlord has breached subsection 107(1) of the Act, the Tenants’ application should be granted.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.       
The Landlord shall pay to the Tenants the sum of $4,300.00. This amount represents
$4,300.00 collected for the first
and last month’s
rent deposit.
 
2.       
The Landlord shall also pay to the Tenants
$53.00 for the cost of filing the application.




 
3.       
If the Landlord does not pay the Tenants
the full amount owing by February 6, 2022, the Landlord will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 7, 2022, at 2.00% annually on the
outstanding balance.
 
4.       
The Tenants have the right, at any time, to collect
the full amount
owing or any balance outstanding under this order.
