On January 24, 2022, Mahan Habibi

for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Reilly
Macdonald (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant entered into an agreement to
terminate the tenancy.

terminate the tenancy as of January 20, 2022 and the Tenant did not move out of the rental
unit by the termination date
set out in the agreement.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 15, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February
15, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 15, 2022, then starting
February 16, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
5.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 16, 2022.
