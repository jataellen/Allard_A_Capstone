Order under Sections 69 and 89
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-80320-17
 










 
 
 

I.S. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict G.K. (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the
Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after
the termination date.
 
This
application was heard in Peterborough on June 23, 2017.
 
Only
the Landlord’s representative, K.A., attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
THE
APPLICATION ALLEGING NEGLIGENT OR WILFUL DAMAGE
1.      At
the hearing, the Landlord requested the consent of the Board to withdraw their
application with respect to allegation of negligent or wilful damage.
2.      In
accordance with subsection 200(4) of the Act, I consent to the withdrawal of
the application. 
THE
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
3.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from February 1, 2017 to June 30, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective April 29, 2017.
4.      The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending June 30, 2017 total $2,430.00.
5.      The
Landlord incurred costs of $190.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
6.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $750.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
7.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from October 1, 2016
to April 29, 2017 totalling $6.50.
8.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is
ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before July 7, 2017.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,092.41*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to June 26, 2017, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $16.77 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting June 27, 2017 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before July
7, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from July 8, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before July 7, 2017, then starting July 8, 2017,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 8, 2017.
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $2,620.00 if the payment is made on or before June 30, 2017, or
ii)       $3,385.00 if the payment is made on or before July 7, 2017**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after July 8, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
