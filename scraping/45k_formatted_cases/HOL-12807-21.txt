Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12807-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


MAIN FLOOR, 6709 MONTROSE ROAD NIAGARA FALLS ON L2H0Z6


 




Between:


Marguerite Meier


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jemma
Fulton Tyler Swalm


Tenants



 
 
 
Marguerite Meier
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tyler
Swalm and Jemma Fulton (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay
the rent they owe because the Tenants failed to
meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on
December 3, 2021 with respect to application HOL-11883-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenants have not met the following
condition specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $1500.00 rent on
or before November 26, 2021.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenants were
ordered to pay $9,486.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the
Landlord's application fee in Order HOL-11883-21. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $9,486.00 and that amount is included
in this order. As a result,
the previous order
HOL-11883-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenants
have failed to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from November 26,
2021 to January 25, 2022.




File Number: HOL-12807-21
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Order HOL-11883-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 23, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $11,173.67*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January
12, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the previous
application.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $49.32
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 13, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
23, 2022, the Tenants will start
to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from
January 24, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 23, 2022, then starting January
24, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 24, 2022.

The tenant has until January 22, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 22, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
