In the matter
of:


11, 70 HUCKNALL ROAD TORONTO ON M3J1V9


 




Between:


Hillock Investments Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Ilana
  Adamovich


Tenant



 
 
 
Hillock
Investments Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Ilana Adamovich (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant
of the rental unit or someone the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex
has wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage; and because the
Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on November 8, 2021. The Landlord was represented by its Property Manager
Simon Parker and by Representative Samuel Korman. The Tenant attended and consulted with
Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The application is
based on a voidable Notice of Termination served on the Tenant on September 9, 2020 with a termination date of September
30, 2020 because
the Tenant or an occupant of the rental unit or a
person permitted in the residential complex by the Tenant has substantially
interfered with the lawful rights privileges or interests of the Landlord and wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit done. The
notice was served pursuant to s. 63 and 64 of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the “Act’).

2.    
The Tenant
vacated the rental
unit on May 31, 2021.
 
3.    
In the notice of termination, the Tenant was permitted to void the notice if they paid the
Landlord $5,000.00. The Tenant did not void the notice,
however, after the application
was filed the Tenant vacated the rental unit so the application for eviction is
moot.
 
4.    
The only issue left
unresolved is the Landlord’s request for damages. S. 89 of the Act permits a Landlord to make an application
requiring the Tenant to pay reasonable costs for repair or replacement where
the Tenant, their guests or an occupant
causes undue damage. In this case,
the Landlord did not request an order for payment of damages in the L2 application filed on September
21, 2020. Therefore, the Board has no jurisdiction to make an award for damages.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
