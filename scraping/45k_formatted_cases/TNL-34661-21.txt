Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-34661-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


103, 1216 YORK MILLS
ROAD TORONTO ON M3A1Y6


 




Between:


Capreit Limited Partnership


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Alonso Vasquez


Tenant



 
 
 
Capreit Limited
Partnership (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Alonso Vasquez (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay
the rent that the Tenant owes.
The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges and related administration
charges.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on December 13, 2021.
Only the Landlord’s Legal
Representative, Jason Paine, attended the hearing. As of 2:35 p.m., the Tenant
was not present or represented at the hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period
from August 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective August 30, 2021.
 
2.     The
Landlord incurred charges
of $5.00 for a cheque tendered by or on behalf of the
Tenant, which was returned NSF and $20.00 for related administration charges.
 
3.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
4.    
The lawful monthly rent is
$1,137.57.
 
5.     The
Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,137.57 from the
Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from March 1, 2020 to August 30, 2021.
 
7.    
The Tenant paid $4,550.28 after the application was filed.




File Number: TNL-34661-21
 
8.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the parties and whether
the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant
voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 7, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall
pay to the Landlord $1,067.44*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 27, 2022
and the total charges related to a NSF cheque tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant,
less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$37.40 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 28, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
7, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 8, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 7, 2022, then starting February
8, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord, on or after February 8, 2022.
 
8.     If
the Tenant wishes
to void this order and continue the tenancy,
the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)          
$2,486.14 if the payment
is made on or before January 31, 2022, or
ii)         
$3,623.71 if the payment
is made on or before
February 7, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may
make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after
February 8, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The




File Number: TNL-34661-21
 
Tenant is only entitled
to make this motion once during the period
of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
