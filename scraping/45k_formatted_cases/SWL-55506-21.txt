Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October 4, 2021.

the rental unit on January
11, 2022. The Tenants were in

rent was $1,100.00.
 
4.    
The Tenants have made no payments
since the application was filed.

and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on January
11, 2022. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
