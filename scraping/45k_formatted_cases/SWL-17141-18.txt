Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-17141-18
 
TB
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict AC
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the
Tenant's rent. 
 
This application was heard in [CITY] on July 18,
2018.  The Landlord attended the hearing.  The Tenant attended the hearing and
spoke with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has been in the
rental unit since late 2015, and has been in a month-to-month tenancy since
2016.  Rent is currently $925.00 per month, and is due on the first of each
month.
2.     
The Landlord asserts that
even as far back as 2016, the Tenant has been persistently late with her rent. 
The Tenant acknowledged that since Christmas 2017, she has been persistently
late and has been trying to catch up.  
3.     
On May 3, 2018, the Landlord
testified that the Tenant tried to make a partial rent/arrears payment on the
condition that the Tenant could stay in the rental unit and the Landlord would
not seek to terminate the tenancy.  The Landlord refused these conditions and
served the Tenant with a Notice to Terminate a Tenancy at the End of the Term
(Form N8) on May 22, 2018 with a termination date of July 31, 2018.
4.     
The Tenant’s recollection of
this incident on May 3, 2018 was slightly different.  The Tenant testified that
when the Landlord attended the rental unit on that day to collect the rent, the
Tenant “was going to get it” when the Landlord stopped her.  They had a conversation
about adding someone to the Tenant’s lease.  The Landlord did not agree to add
a new person to the Tenant’s existing lease, and insisted that a new lease be
signed between the parties.  The Tenant refused to enter into a new lease, and
the Landlord then refused to accept the rent payment the Tenant was intending
to pay.  The Tenant has not paid rent since, nor has the Landlord attended the
rental unit to request the rent payments. 
5.     
Section 58 of the Act sets
out that a landlord may give a tenant notice of termination of their tenancy if
the tenant has persistently failed to pay rent on the date it becomes due and
payable.  The Landlord claimed, and the Tenant did not dispute, that the Tenant
has been late with the rent on a regular basis since the commencement of the
tenancy.  In addition, there is no question that the Tenant was late with the
rent for the first five months of 2018, and has not paid rent since April
2018.  Therefore, I am satisfied that the Tenant has persistently failed to pay
the rent on the date it was due.
6.     
As successful applicant, the
Landlord is entitled to the application filing fee.
 
Relief from Eviction:
 
7.     
Having found the Landlord has
proven the allegation in his application, I will turn my mind to relief from
eviction, as required under section 83 of the Act.
8.     
The Landlord opposed any
delay in the termination date, as he asserted the Tenant has had notice of his
intent to terminate the tenancy on July 31, 2018 since May 2018.  The Landlord
also opposed the issuance of a conditional order, which would give the Tenant
one more chance to pay her rent on time for a period of one year.  The Landlord
asserted he has brought the Tenant before the Board twice for non-payment of
rent, and said he has run his “wheels off” trying to collect rent from the
Tenant.  He has attended the rental unit on numerous occasions to collect the
rent, only to have the Tenant make some excuse as to why full payment of the
rent was not possible for her that month.  He has tried to work with the Tenant
for two years, and at this time the Tenant is in arrears of more than
$3,000.00.
9.     
The Tenant asserted that the
Landlord had refused her rent payments, which is why she was in arrears. 
However, the Tenant acknowledged she did not seek out the Landlord to try to
pay rent since May 2018, and did not have the money anymore to make the rent
payments.  The Tenant is a single mother of a teenage son, and she relies on
social assistance for her income source.  She does not get any child support. 
The Tenant has corrected some child tax benefit issues and is expecting a
retroactive payment in the next few months.  The Tenant said she had no place
to go at the end of this month. 
10.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until August 31, 2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of
the Act.  While I considered denying the eviction on the condition that the
Tenant pay her rent of time for a year, ultimately I do not think that would be
fair to the Landlord, as I am not convinced the Tenant will be able to make her
rent payments on time until her financial situation stabilizes when her child
tax benefit issues are resolved, which the Tenant stated could be as late as
October 2018.  However in consideration of the Tenant’s status as a single
parent, and given that she has not yet made alternate housing arrangements, I
find it would not be unfair to give the Tenant a few more weeks to find another
place to live in time to enroll her son in school.    
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before August 31, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
3.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing on or before August 31, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
September 1, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
4.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before August 31, 2018, then starting September 1, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
5.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after September 1, 2018.
