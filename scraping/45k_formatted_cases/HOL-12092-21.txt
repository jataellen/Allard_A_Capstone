Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Charmaine Chung
  Cherry Jackson Dwight Dennis


Tenants



 
 
 
Mausumi Mallick (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Charmaine Chung
(CC), Cherry Jackson
and Dwight Dennis
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the
rent that the Tenants owe. The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges and
related administration charges.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 5,
2022.
 
The Landlord’s representative, Nanda
Mallick, and the Tenant,
CC, attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord’s certificate of service for the notice
of termination states
that the notice
of termination was mailed to the Tenants on September 2, 2021.
 
2.     The termination date on the notice of termination is September 17, 2021.
 
3.     A document served by mail is deemed
to be received five days after mailing.
In this case, the notice of termination is deemed to have been received
on September 7, 2021.
 
4.     The termination date on the notice of termination is not 14 days from the date the notice of termination was deemed to have
been served on the Tenants.
 
5.     No evidence was presented to show that the notice of termination came to the attention
of the Tenants prior to the deemed date of service.
 
6.    
As a result, the Landlord’s application is dismissed because
the notice period
on the notice of termination
was insufficient.
