Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-81400-17
 










 
 

Landlord’s
L1 application.
L-C.H.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict K.S.
and R.S. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
Landlord’s
L2 application.
L-C.H.
(the 'Landlord') also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict K.S.and
R.S.(the 'Tenants') because they, another occupant of the rental unit or
someone they permitted in the residential complex have wilfully or negligently
caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the damage. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
These
applications were heard in Whitby on July 24, 2017.
 
Only
the Landlord’s agent D.A. attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      With
respect to the Landlord’s L1 application, the
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from March 1, 2017 to July 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective June 9, 2017.
2.      The
Tenants paid $5,100.00 after the application was filed.
3.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
4.      With
respect to the Landlord’s L2 application, the
Landlord served the Tenants with an N5 notice for two primary reasons.
5.      The
first was over the presence of large amounts of garbage that was in the back
yard. The Landlord’s agent states that this has now been removed.
6.      The
second is over the existence of a not allowed incomplete shed.
7.      The
shed has to be removed or at least dealt with in such a manner that is approved
by the Landlord and this order will reflect same.
8.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act. 
9.      The
reasons contained in this order constitute all of the reasons used in making my
decision. 
It
is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before August 7, 2017.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $1,267.20*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to July 27, 2017.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $47.67 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting July 28, 2017 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before August
7, 2017, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from August 8, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before August 7, 2017, then starting August 8,
2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after August 8, 2017.
8.      If
the Tenants wish to void this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $1,640.00 if the payment is made on or before July 31, 2017, or
ii)       $3,090.00 if the payment is made on or before August 7, 2017**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after August 8, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
10.   If
the Tenants void this order as per paragraph # 8 or # 9, then on or before
August 15, 2017 the Tenants shall remove or deal with the shed in such a manner
that it is approved by the Landlord.
11.   Failure
to do as directed in paragraph # 10 will allow the Landlord to apply to the
board under Section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act (2006), without
notice to the Tenants, for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenants. The Landlord must make this application no later than 30 days after
the Tenant’s breach of paragraph # 10.
