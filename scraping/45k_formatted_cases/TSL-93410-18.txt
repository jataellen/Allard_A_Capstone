Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-93410-18
 










 

M.C
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict D.P
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. (L1
application)
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the
Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with
the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord
or another tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date. (L2 application)
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on April 20, 2018.
 
Only
the Landlord’s legal representative, S.M.K, attended the hearing. S.K (SK)
testified on behalf of the Landlord.
            
Determinations:
 
            L1 Application
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from February 1, 2018 to April 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective February 23, 2018.
2.      The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
3.      The monthly rent as of the date of the hearing is $1,127.19.
4.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,126.51 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from October 1, 2017
to February 23, 2018.
6.      The
Tenant paid $2,254.38 after the application was filed.
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
            L2
application         
8.      The
Landlord served an N5 Notice to End your Tenancy For Interfering with Others
(‘N5 notice’) on January 22, 2018. The N5 notice alleges that the Tenant has
failed to maintain the unit in a state of ordinary cleanliness and that the
Tenant has been using the balcony for storage. The N5 notice gives the Tenant
seven days to correct the problems. The voiding period for the N5 notice is
from January 23 to January 29, 2018.
9.      SK
is an employee of the Landlord. At the hearing SK testified that the facts set
out in the N5 notice and the Landlord’s application are true. At the hearing SK
submitted photographs of the unit taken by the superintendent on December 18,
2017. These photographs show the unit to be in a very cluttered condition.
10.   SK
testified that the Landlord’s superintendent attended at the unit on January
30, 2018 and found the unit to be in a very cluttered condition, including the
balcony. At the hearing SK submitted photographs taken on January 30, 2018
showing the unit, including the balcony, to be in a very cluttered condition.
11.   SK
testified that the Landlord’s superintendent attended at the unit on April 19,
2018 and found the unit to be in a very cluttered condition, including the
balcony. At the hearing SK submitted photographs taken on April 19, 2018
showing the unit, including the balcony, to be in a very cluttered condition.
12.   Based
on the Landlord’s uncontested evidence, I am satisfied, on a balance of
probabilities, that the unit was in a very cluttered condition just after the
voiding period. I therefore find that the Tenant did not void the N5 notice.
13.   Based
on the Landlord’s uncontested evidence, I am satisfied, on a balance of
probabilities, that the unit is still in a very cluttered condition. I
therefore find that the state of the unit substantially interferes with the
Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment of the premises. 
14.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
            L1 application         
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the rent arrears portion of this order as set out below, the
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. (The tenancy is also
terminated on May 5, 2018 due to substantial interference).  The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before May 5, 2018.
2.      As
of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord
owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the
Landlord is entitled to by $313.07*.
3.      However,
the Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the
Landlord owes the Tenant: $37.06 per day for compensation for the use of the
unit starting April 25, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit, and $190.00
for the cost of filing the application.
4.      The
Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as
a result of this order.
5.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before May 5, 2018, then starting May 6, 2018,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
6.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 6, 2018.
7.      If
the Tenant wishes to void the rent arrears portion of this order and continue
the tenancy (until the tenancy is terminated on May 5, 2018 for substantial
interference), the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $1,317.19 if the payment is made on or before April 30, 2018, or
ii)       $2,444.38 if the payment is made on or before May 5, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside the rent arrears portion of this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after May 6, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this
motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
            L2
application
1.      The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated on May 5, 2018. The
Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before May 5, 2018.
2.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before May 5, 2018, then starting May 6, 2018,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
3.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 6, 2018.
