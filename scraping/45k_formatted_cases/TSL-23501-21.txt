204, 2519
LAKE SHORE BOULEVARD W ETOBICOKE ON M8V1E3


 




Between:


Beaches West Development Ltd


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Maureen Bortkiewicz


Tenant



 
 
 
Beaches West Development Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Maureen Bortkiewicz (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 12, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Michelle Lees, attended the hearing. As of 10:10 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
July 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective February
18, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $919.99
as of January 1, 2022.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $909.09 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from October 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020.
 
6.    
The Tenant paid $2,418.18
after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the




File Number: TSL-23501-21
 
Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 1, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $3,586.65*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
18, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $30.25 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 19, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before March 1, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 2, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 1, 2022, then starting
March 2, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 2, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)    
$5,062.34 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022,
or
ii)     $5,982.33 if the payment is made on or before
March 1, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after March
2, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
