Review Order
 
Galaxy Value Add Ontario
Properties LP (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order requiring Kevin Cole
(the 'Tenant') to pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved by order
SOL-22846-21 issued on November 19, 2021.
On November 19, 2021, the Landlord requested a review of the order.
The request was heard by videoconference on February 7, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord’s legal representative M. Forrester attended
the hearing.
 
Note: the application incorrectly states the rental
unit is in Toronto, whereas
the unit is in St. Catharines. The application is
amended to reflect the correct address.
 
Determinations:
 
Review
 
1.     The Landlord’s request
for a review is based on the ground of being not reasonably able to participate in the proceedings.
 
2.     The hearing that gave rise to the order under
review took place on October
26, 2021. The Landlord did not send a representative.
 
3.     At the review hearing the Landlord’s legal
representative submitted that the Landlord keeps track of upcoming
hearings in a database and that the hearing for this matter
was entered incorrectly. As a result the Landlord did not send a representative.

4.    
Based on the Landlord’s
uncontested submissions, at the hearing I found, on a balance of probabilities,
that the Landlord was not reasonably able to participate in the proceedings. Accordingly I granted the review request
and the Landlord’s L9 application proceeded de novo.
 
L9 application
 
5.     The Landlord sold the building
to a new owner on April 29, 2021. The Landlord claims arrears to this date.
 
6.     The amount owed by the Tenant to April 29, 2021 is $673.72. The Tenant also owes the Landlord $201.00 for the cost of
filing this application. The total amount owed by the Tenant is $874.72.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     Order SOL-22846-21 issued
on November 19, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the
following:
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $673.72, which represents the amount of rent owing up to April 29, 2021.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before
February 26, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated
from February 27, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
