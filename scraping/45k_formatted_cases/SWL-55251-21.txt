Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55251-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


201, 130 SHELDON AVENUE CHATHAM ON N7L3M7


 




Between:


Skyline Living


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Krista Chevalier


Tenant



 
 
 
Skyline Living
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Krista
Chevalier (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant.
 
This
application was heard via videoconference on January 24, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s legal agent, M. Mclellan, attended the hearing. As of 10:37 a.m.,
the Tenant was not present or represented although properly served with notice
of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord served an N5 Notice of Termination on
September 16, 2021. The Notice alleges that during
inspections of the unit, it was discovered there was substantial damage to the carpet, appliances, a strong foul odor emanating
from the unit, deep cleaning was required in the bathroom, kitchen and living
areas and fleas were discovered in the unit. Further, the Tenant does not have
rental insurance.
 
2.    
Subsection 64 (1) of the Act states:
 
A landlord
may give a tenant notice
of termination of the tenancy
if the conduct of the tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the tenant is
such that it substantially interferes with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex for all usual purposes
by the landlord or another tenant or substantially interferes
with another lawful right, privilege or interest of the landlord or another
tenant. 2006, c. 17, s. 64 (1).
 
3.    
Subsection 64(3) states that the
notice of termination under subsection (1) is void if the tenant, within
seven days after
receiving the notice,
stops the conduct
or activity or corrects
the omission.

4.     Based on the uncontested evidence of the Landlord, I
find that the Tenant substantially interfered with the Landlord and other
tenant’s reasonable enjoyment. The Landlord submitted that the smell
emanating from the unit goes down the hall and they had received
multiple complaints from other tenants regarding the smell. The Landlord also
received complaints regarding the smell from those accessing
the laundry room, which is located on the same floor as the Tenant’s unit. I
also find that the Tenant did not void the Notice as the Landlord’s evidence
was that the smell was still emanating from the unit within seven days after
the Notice was served.
 
5.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
6.     The Landlord submitted that they continued
to receive complaints regarding the smell
after the Notice was served. In consideration of the foregoing, and the
fact that the Tenant did not attend the hearing to disclose her circumstances for me to consider denying
or delaying eviction, relief
will not be granted.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated, as of February
28, 2022. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 28, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2022, then starting
March 1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction
may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March
1, 2022.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on September 1, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this
date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial
jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
