Residential Tenancies Act, 2006

In the matter
of:


210, 5 BIGGIN COURT TORONTO ON M4A1M2


 




Between:


Centurion Property Associates Inc


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Lassana
Gassama


Tenant



 
On November
11, 2021, Centurion Property
Associates Inc (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Lassana Gassama (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have
the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a
condition specified in the order issued by the Board on May 10, 2021 with
respect to application TNL-28146-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed
to pay to the Landlord
$1,533.66 on or before October
15, 2021 towards arrears of
rent.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $3,033.66 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
TNL-28146-20. The amount
that is still owing from that
order is $1,120.70 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order TNL-28146-20 is cancelled.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,455.71 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2020 to January 6, 2022.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TNL-28146-20 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 17, 2022.
 
3.    
As of the date of this
order, the Tenant owes no money to the Landlord because the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit
exceeds the amount of rent arrears up to November 30, 2021, that
the Landlord is entitled to under this order by $368.57.
 
4.    
The Landlord
is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenant:
$48.88 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting December 1,
2021 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.    
The Landlord
or the Tenant shall pay any amounts
that become owing as a result of this
order.
 
6.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
17, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 18, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
7.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January
18, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after January 18, 2022.
 
 
January 6, 2022                                                                                 Date Issued                                                                       Jim McMaster

The tenant has until January 16, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 16, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.
 
If you have any questions about this order,
call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.




 
In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on July 18, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction
where the rental unit is located.
