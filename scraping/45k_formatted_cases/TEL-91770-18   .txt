Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-91770-18
 











 
 
 

W. S. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict M. D. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Whitby on June 22, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, S.
P., and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
The Tenant was assisted by Tenant
Duty Counsel.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from April 1, 2018 to
June 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective June 2, 2018.
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,850.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from August 1, 2017 to June 2, 2018.
4.     
The Landlord’s update sheet
at the hearing confirms that the Tenant owes $2245.00 for rent and costs to
June 30, 2018. This was not disputed.
5.     
The Tenant testified on her
personal circumstances that led to her mounting rental arrears at the hearing.
She stated that when she moved into the rental unit in September 2017 she had
been temporarily laid off from her work at General Motors due to a forced shut
down. She works in assembly and is paid $34.83 per hour. 
6.     
The Tenants regular position
is a full time position that nets her approximately $4100.00 monthly. She has
now returned to her full time position.
7.     
The Tenant is a single
mother of two children and also receives a child tax credit of $262.00 monthly
and child support of $286.00 monthly.
8.     
In November 2017, and in
March 2018 the Tenant had surgery. She provided medical documents at the
hearing confirming her surgery and testified that following the March 2018
surgery she needed 7 weeks to recover.
9.     
She testified that in
December 2017 she was denied EI and sick leave. Up until December 2017 the
Tenant had no problem meeting her rental obligations. As a result of her
medical issues, the Tenant began falling behind in her payments. She testified
that in March 2018, she was starting to get caught up and then learned that she
needed additional surgery which resulted in 7 weeks off of work for recovery.
10.  
The Tenant began receiving
55% of her wage in May 2018 and in May 2018 she paid $700.00. In June the
Tenant paid her full rent.
11.  
The Tenant acknowledged in
cross examination that she not only fell behind in her rent but also in her
utility bills. She had brought in another tenant to help with the rent who now
pays $600.00 in monthly rent.
12.  
Her evidence was that she is
making every effort to catch up and recover from her set back. The Tenant
provided a proposed repayment plan that would have the arrears fully paid up by
August 10, 2018.
13.  
This repayment plan was not
acceptable to the Landlord. The Landlord did not provide testimony however the
Landlord’s representative submits that the Landlord is a small Landlord who is
suffering from extreme hardship by the Tenant’s failure to pay rent in full and
on time. No supporting documentation was provided on this issue. The Landlord
cannot wait until August for the Tenant to pay the arrears in full.
14.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The
extenuating circumstance of the tenant and the aggressive repayment plan that
is proposed outweigh the Landlord’s circumstances.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Tenant owes the Landlord
$2245.00 in arrears and costs up to June 30, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord the amount set out in paragraph 1 above in accordance with the
following schedule:
 
(1)  $300.00 on or before June 22, 2018; 
 
(2)  $324.17 on or before July 6, 2018;
 
(3)  $324.17 on or before July 13, 2018;
 
(4)  $324.17 on or before July 20, 2018;
 
(5)  $324.17 on or before July 27, 2018;
 
(6)  $324.17 on or before August 3, 2018;
 
(7)  $324.15 on or before August 10, 2018.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord new rent as it comes due on the first day of each month from July
1, 2018, to August 30, 2018. 
4.     
If the Tenant fails to make
any one of the payments in accordance with this order, the outstanding balance
of any arrears of rent and costs to be paid by the Tenant to the Landlord
pursuant to paragraph 1 of this order shall become immediately due and owing
and the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to the Board pursuant
to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenant and requiring that the Tenants pay any new arrears, NSF fees and related
charges that became owing after June 30, 2018. The Landlord must make this
application no later than 30 days after the Tenants failure to make a payment.
