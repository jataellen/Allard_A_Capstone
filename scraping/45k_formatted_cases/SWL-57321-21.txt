Landlords




 


 
and

Oliveira


Tenants



 
 
 
2867471 Ontario Inc., Daniel
Smith and Alyssa Morgan (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Steve Oliveira and Kimberly Bell (the 'Tenants') because
they have been persistently late in paying their rent. The Landlords also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard via video conference on February 17, 2022.
 
The personally named Landlords and the Tenants
attended the hearing.
The Tenants were represented by Duty Counsel, Kristen
Thompson, at the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
There is no dispute
that the Tenants
have persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
The Tenants have paid their rent late 46 out of 52 times since November 2017.
 
2.    
The Tenants argue they are
entitled to mandatory relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(3)(a)
because the Landlords are in serious breach of their responsibilities under the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') and because the reason for
the application is that the Tenants “complained to a governmental authority”
pursuant to subsection 83(3)(b) . In
the alternative, the Tenants seek discretionary relief from
eviction in the form of a conditional order requiring them to pay rent on time in the future
(pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act).
 
3.    
The Landlords oppose all of the Tenants’ requests.
 
4.    
For the following reasons,
I find that the Tenants
are not entitled to mandatory
relief from eviction, but I
am prepared to exercise my discretion to grant discretionary relief in the




 
form of a conditional order requiring them to pay rent on time in the future or
face eviction.
 
Serious Breach
 
5.    
The Tenants say that the Landlords
are in serious breach of their obligations because the floorboards in the rental unit are and the balcony door are
in a state of disrepair. The Landlords do not dispute the fact that some of the
floorboards are gapped and lifting and the balcony door does not fit perfectly
in the door frame letting in a draft.
 
6.    
These items of disrepair
constitute a breach of the Landlords’ obligation to maintain the unit in a good
state of repair pursuant to subsection 20(1) of the Act, but that is not the
issue before the Board. The question here is whether or not they constitute a
“serious” breach within the meaning of 83(3)(a).
For the reasons that follow,
I am not satisfied that they do.
 
7.    
The use of the word “serious”
means that not every ongoing
breach will lead to relief
from eviction being mandatory. Rather the breaches complained of must be
sufficiently egregious that refusal of a landlord’s right to reclaim possession
under the Act must be a reasonable result. For example, in Sage v.
Wellington (County), [2005] O.J. No. 5727 (Ont. Div. Ct.) the Court found the lack of potable water
was sufficiently serious to justify mandatory
relief from eviction
because it did not
comply with mandatory health standards set out in the Health
Protection and Promotion Act. A draughty door and gaps in floorboards
simply do not rise to that level. As a result, the Tenants are not entitled to
mandatory relief from eviction on the basis that the Landlords are in serious
breach of their obligations. That being said, the Tenants may wish to pursue a
remedy for these problems by filing an application with the Board.
 
Retaliation
 
8.    
The Tenants allege that the notice
of termination for persistent late payment was served
on them because they contacted the municipality to complain of disrepair. I disagree.
 
9.    
The problem with the Tenants’ argument
is there is no temporal
connection between the complaints to the municipality and the
service of the notice of termination.
 
10. 
The Tenants have lived
in the rental unit since 2017. Their tenancy agreement
was with a previous owner of the property. The
Tenants contacted the municipality about various issues of disrepair and the municipality
issued an order on December 4,
2019, instructing the previous landlord to make various repairs by January 24,
2020. But the Landlords here did not purchase the property until November of
2021 and the notice of termination that is allegedly retaliatory was served on
November 30, 2021. Given that there was gap of more than a year and a half
between the complaints to the municipality and the service of the notice of termination, not
to mention a new landlord, there is simply no temporal connection between the
complaints and the decision to serve the notice.




 
The Conditional Order
 
11. 
Regarding the Tenants’ request for
a conditional order, I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act. In particular, I have considered
the acquiescence by the previous landlord to the Tenants’ late payments, the Tenants’ economic
status, their medical
conditions, and the vulnerability of the household. The Tenants have lived
in the rental unit since 2017 and they have 3 children ages 14, 13 and 3.
 
12. 
The Landlords are opposed to a
conditional order because they do not believe that the Tenants are capable of
paying their rent on time. I disagree. The second-named Tenant has recently
acquired additional government funding for his medical conditions as well
funding for transportation to his medical appointments. This extra source of
income means that the first-named Tenant is now free to increase her hours at
work which will also increase the household income. Also, the second-named
Tenant says that he has informed his extended family about all of the
unfortunate events he has experienced and his family has offered to help him financially in the months to come to help pay
the rent in the event of any
unanticipated expenses. For these reasons, I am satisfied on the balance of
probabilities that the Tenants are capable of paying their rent on time and I
find that it would not be unfair
to grant relief from eviction subject
to the conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection
83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
13. 
This order contains all the reasons
within it and no further reasons
will be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords the monthly rent due
on time and in full for the period April 1, 2022 to March 31,
2023.
 
2.    
If the Tenants fail to make any
one of the payments in accordance with this order, the Landlords may, without notice
to the Tenants, apply to the Board
pursuant to section
78 of the Act for an order
terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants. The Landlords
must make this application no later than 30 days after the Tenants’ failure to
make a payment.
 
3.    
On or before March 31, 2022,
the Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $186.00 for the costs
of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before March 31, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from April 1,
2022, at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding
