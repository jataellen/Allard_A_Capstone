Order under Section 31
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOT-42472-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


3, 246 ST CHARLES STREET SUDBURY ON P3C2Z2


 




Between:


Curtis Brown


Tenant




 


 
and


 




 


Guy Lehoux


Landlord



 
 
 
Curtis Brown (the 'Tenant') applied for an order determining that Guy Lehoux (the 'Landlord') or the Landlord's agent harassed,
obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with the Tenant.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 18, 2021.
Only the Tenant attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant
testified that another tenant, Shelley Lynnds (SL), has threatened him with a
shovel and substantially interfered with his reasonable enjoyment of the residential
complex by verbally abusing him, playing loud music, banging on the floor and
smoking marijuana. From time to time the Tenant has had to stay with family to have some peace.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s duty to address
substantial interference with the reasonable enjoyment of a tenant
by another tenant was affirmed by the Divisional Court in Hassan v. Niagara
Housing Authority, [2000] O.J. No. 5650.
The Court held at paragraph 16ff:
 
It is not that the other
tenant's actions are imputed to the landlord, but, rather, the landlord's legal
responsibility to provide the tenant with quiet enjoyment that gives rise to
the responsibility on the landlord to take reasonable steps to correct
the intrusion of the neighbouring tenant
on the tenant's right to
quiet enjoyment.
 
As under the old Landlord and
Tenant Act so under the new Tenant Protection
Act, the landlord
has the positive obligation to provide the tenant
with quiet enjoyment and take the reasonably necessary action against
any tenant that denies a neighbouring tenant quiet enjoyment of his
premises.




File Number: NOT-42472-21
 
 
 
 
3.     The uncontested evidence
of the Tenant is that he informed
the Landlord of SL’s conduct on several occasions and the
Landlord has done nothing. Therefore, I find that the Landlord harassed, threatened, and interfered with the Tenant’s
reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex.
 
4.    
The Tenant did not request an abatement of rent. He asked the Board to evict the other
tenant. This remedy is not available to the Tenant. The Board does not have
jurisdiction to evict a tenant on behalf
another tenant who has filed a
tenant application. The Board can only terminate an applicant
tenant’s tenancy.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord shall take reasonable and effective steps within a reasonable length
of time to restore to the
tenant the quiet enjoyment of the residential complex.
 
2.     If the Landlord
fails to apply with this order, the Tenant may file a new application and request remedies that the Board has jurisdiction to grant.
