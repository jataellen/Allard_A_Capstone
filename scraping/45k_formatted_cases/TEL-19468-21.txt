Tenants



 
 
 
2658333 Ontario Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Terry Hubbs, Donna West and Jordan Dstrowski (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 20, 2021.
The Landlord's Legal Representative, Surya Sasan, and the Tenant, Terry Hubbs,
attended the hearing. The Tenant declined the opportunity to speak with Duty
Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
The
Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the
period from July 15, 2021 to November 30, 2021 because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 6, 2021.
 
2.   
The
Tenants vacated the rental unit on November 18,
2021. The Tenants were in possession of the rental unit on the date the
application was filed.
 
3.    The lawful monthly
rent was $1,780.00.
 
4.   
The Landlord
is not holding a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.   
At the
hearing, the Tenant, Terry Hubbs, disputed the amount of rent arrears claimed
by the Landlord. The Tenant testified that a payment, in the amount of
$1,780.00, had been paid to the Landlord on July 22, 2021 via e-transfer and
the Landlord had accepted the payment.




 
6.   
The
Tenant further testified that he had delivered the balance of the money owed to
the Landlord at an address provided by the Landlord on the Tenancy Agreement.
 
7.   
The
Landlord’s Legal Representative submitted that the Landlord did not receive any
payments and submitted that the update form filed with the Board was correct.
 
8.   
In
review of the update form with the Landlord’s Legal Representative, it was
determined that the form was incorrect as an additional month of rent had be
added.
 
9.   
The
Tenant testified that he did not receive a copy of the update form and was
unable to provide any evidence to support his claim that the payments had been
made.
 
10.
The
Tenant was afforded the opportunity to provide his evidence of the payments
made to the Landlord by way of post-hearing submissions by no later than
January 7, 2022.
 
11.
The Tenant
submitted his evidence
to the Board and to the Landlord
on January 4, 2022.
 
12.
The Landlord
did not submit any rebuttal
evidence.
 
13.
The
Tenant’s evidence included his bank statement and confirmation of the
e-transfer on July 22, 2021 and confirmation that the Landlord had accepted the
payment.
 
Analysis:
 
14.
The N4
Notice of Termination (‘N4 Notice’) was served upon the Tenant on August 16,
2021. The rental periods for which rent had not been paid were July 15, 2021 to August 15,
2021. The termination date on the N4
Notice was September 6, 2021.
 
15.
Although the N4 Notice
is defective on its face,
as the rental periods are not valid,
the Tenant vacated the rental
unit on November 18, 2021 thus the Landlord was seeking an order for arrears
only.
 
16.
Upon review
of the evidence submitted by the Tenant,
I am satisfied that a rent payment
for July was made to the Landlord on July 22, 2021 therefore voiding the
N4 Notice.
 
17.
The Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) at section
59(3) sets out that; the Notice of Termination is void if, before the day
the Landlord applies to the Board for an order terminating the tenancy and
evicting the Tenant based on the notice, the Tenant pays, (a) the rent that is in arrears
under the tenancy
agreement and (b) the additional rent that would have been due under the tenancy
agreement as at the date of payment by the tenant had notice of termination not
been given.




 
18. I am satisfied that the Tenant voided
the N4 Notice of Termination prior to the termination date on the notice and
for that reason, the application must be dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1. The application is dismissed.
