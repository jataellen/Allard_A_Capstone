Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19092-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


BASEMENT, 69 IAN FLEMING
CRESCENT WHITBY ON L1R2X6


 




Between:


Suchismita Chakroborty Santanu Chakroborty


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Jerry Shaban Stephen Hayes


Tenants



 
 
Suchismita
Chakroborty and Santanu Chakroborty (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Stephen Hayes and Jerry
Shaban (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 8, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Christopher Williams attended the
hearing. As of 10:32 a.m., the
Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the
period from March 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of
Termination effective August 28, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,200.00.
 
4.     
The Tenants
have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.      The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,200.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit is still being held by the Landlords.
 
6.      Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from August
1, 2020 to August 28, 2021.
 
7.      I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including
the impact of COVID-19




 
on the parties
and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant
and find that it
would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 16, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlords
$8,431.87*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 5, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlords $39.45
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 6, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before January 16, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January
16, 2022, then starting January
17, 2022, the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that
the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after January 17, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 16, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $10,786.00** to the Landlords or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
17, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
