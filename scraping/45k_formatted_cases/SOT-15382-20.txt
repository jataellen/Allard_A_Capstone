Parente Development Limited Edmond Parente


Landlords



 
Judith Beaudoin (the 'Tenant') applied for an order determining that Edmond Parente
and Parente Development
Limited (the 'Landlords') failed to meet the Landlords' maintenance obligations
under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') or failed to
comply with health, safety, housing or maintenance standards.
This application was heard via video/teleconference on September 22, 2021.
The Tenant and the Landlords attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.     The residential complex
is a six storey multi residential apartment building.
 
2.     The Tenant and the Landlord
entered into a tenancy agreement commencing May 30, 2020.
 
3.    
The Tenant testified that immediately after taking possession of the rental unit on May 30, 2020 the Tenant she began to see clusters of bugs in the rental unit resulting in her being
bitten on her arms, legs and feet.
 
4.    
The Tenant purports that at no time
did the Landlord or a
representative of the Landlord
advise the Tenant that there were previous
problems not only with the rental unit but the residential complex with pest
infestations.
 
5.     The Tenant further
testified that because
of the bug infestation she moved out of the rental unit on June 17, 2020 after
advising the Landlord on June 16, 2020.
 
6.     The Tenant seeks return of rent paid, the deposit
and out of pocket expenses
for moving out and replacing
her property that was damages and disposed of because of the bed bugs.




 
7.    
Subsection 20(1) of the Act states
the following:
A landlord is responsible for
providing and maintaining a residential complex, including the rental units in it, in a good state of repair and fit for
habitation and for complying with health, safety, housing
and maintenance standards.
 
8.     Subsection 20(1) of the Act does not contain an element of fault. Basically, the reason for the breach is not relevant in
determining if a breach occurred. Therefore, regardless of the reasons why a
landlord has not and is unable to provide a rental unit in a good state of
repair and fit for habitation, if they are unable to do so, they will generally
be found to be in breach of their obligations under the Act.
 
9.     The issue in this application is whether or not the Landlord breached
section 20 of the
Act.
 
10.  The Tenant (as applicant) bear the burden
of proof. The standard of proof in proceedings
before the Board is “proof on a balance of probabilities.” By that standard,
the party bearing the burden of proof must show with evidence that, “more
likely than not”, their assertions are true.
 
11.  The Tenant submitted a number of photographs of the bug bites, and of her disposing of certain personal belongings and furnishings.
 
12.  Section 16 of the Act says:
When a landlord or a tenant
becomes liable to pay any amount as a result of a breach of a tenancy agreement, the person entitled
to claim the amount
has a duty to take reasonable steps to minimize the person’s losses.
 
13.  The Tenant alleged
that she reported
to the Landlord on June 16, 2020 the day before she moved out and vacated the
rental unit and disposed of her property.
 
14.  The intention of section 20 of the Act is to make landlords responsible for maintaining their
residential rental complexes and ensuring that landlords are responsible for
rectifying maintenance deficiencies and meeting applicable standards.
 
15.  Guideline 5 of the Landlord and Tenant Board
Interpretation Guidelines states where a landlord responds within a reasonable time, and the response was appropriate to effect
the repair, no abatement or other remedy should be ordered.
 
16.  Although, I find that the Landlords failed to meet the
Landlords' obligations under subsection 20(1) or section 161 of the Act to repair or maintain the rental unit and failed to comply with health, safety
and/or housing maintenance standards. Based on the testimonies and the evidence
given, the Landlord in this instance was not provided an opportunity to
mitigate and attempt to remedy the pest problem in the unit before the Tenant
moved out and disposed of her property.




 
17.  Therefore, in my opinion, the Tenant is not entitled
to her claims. No abatement
or other remedy is awarded.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant’s application is dismissed.
