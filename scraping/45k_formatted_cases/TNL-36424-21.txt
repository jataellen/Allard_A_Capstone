Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-36424-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1421, 4455 BATHURST STREET TORONTO ON M3H5X7


 




Between:


Toronto Commumity Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Hana Treiger


Tenant



 
 
 
Toronto
Commumity Housing Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Hana Treiger (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on September 3, 2021 with respect to application TNL- 28491-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the
following conditions specified in the order: the Tenant shall maintain the
rental unit, including the balcony area, in a safe, clean and reasonable living
condition. The Landlord completed an inspection of the unit on or about
December 8, 2021 and it was noted that the unit was not being kept in a safe or
clean condition. The Landlord observed that the bedroom contained a large
amount of clutter and is not being used for its intended purpose. Further the
balcony of the unit appears to be acting as a storage
space with items
stacked in an unsafe manner.
Further the Tenant had agreed that they would prepare
the unit for pest control treatments, in accordance with the information provided
by the Landlord. The Landlord
provided a report
from a pest control company dated November 25, 2021, indicating that the unit was
unable to be fully treated as the baseboards were blocked, dressers and closets
had not been emptied as required. These instances constitute serious breaches
in the order previously issued by the Board.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 28, 2022.




File Number: TNL-36424-21
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January
28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 29, 2022.
 
 
January 17, 2022                                                                                 Date Issued                                                                       Jim McMaster
Member, Landlord and Tenant Board
 
Toronto North-RO
47 Sheppard
Avenue East, Suite
700, 7th Floor Toronto ON M2N5X5
 
The tenant has until January 27, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 27, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.
 
If you have any questions about
this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.
 
In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on July 29, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction
where the rental unit is located.
