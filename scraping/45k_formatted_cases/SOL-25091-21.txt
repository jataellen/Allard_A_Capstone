Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-25091-21

BSMT STUDIO APT, 4 ELBERTA STREET ST CATHARINES ON L2M5M5


 




Between:


Mark Hulsebosch Cindy Hulsebosch


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Olivia Schwartz


Tenant



 
 
Mark Hulsebosch and Cindy
Hulsebosch (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Olivia
Schwartz (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 18, 2022.
One of the Landlords, Cindy Hulsebosch, their Legal
Representative, Masoud Tchavoshi, and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of
Termination effective September 28, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,000.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlords
collected a rent deposit of $1,000.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlords.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 1, 2021 to September 28, 2021.
 
Landlord Submission
 
7.    
The Landlord's Legal Representative
provided verbal submission that there have been
multiple attempts to work out a payment plan with the Tenant.




 
8.    
The Landlord's Legal Representative provided verbal submission that the Tenant
has been unresponsive and has not paid any amount of rent or payment towards arrears since August 2021.
 
9.     The Landlord's Legal Representative gave submission
that the Tenant provided the Landlord with 2 local references before moving in to the rental unit, and has options to find another place to live.
 
Tenant Submission
 
10. 
The Tenant
gave verbal submission that she has been unemployed since May 2021 due
to injuries, sickness and testing positive for covid.
 
11.  The Tenant submitted that she was receiving OW as a result
of not working due to injuries.
 
12. 
The Tenant
submitted that she chose to pay for other items
like her car and car insurance
instead of her rent.
 
13.  The Tenant
submitted that at the time of the hearing
she was not working and has
no source of income, but had enrolled in school.
 
14.  The Tenant gave submission that her references were not options
for a place to live and
requested an extended termination date of February 28,2022 in order to find a
place to live.
 
Findings and Analysis
 
15. 
According to section
83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”),
when the Board hears an
application for an order to terminate the tenancy, the Board
must consider
all the circumstances to determine if it would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
16.  I find that although the Tenant was unable to work for
a few months as a result of her injuries, which resulted
in the arrears, the Landlord
made several attempts
to work out a
payment plan wit the Tenant.
 
17. 
The Tenant was unresponsive to the Landlord’s attempts
to work out a payment
plan and made no effort to
respond to the Landlord in order to pay arrears and rent.
 
18. 
I find that the arrears are significant to the Landlord,
and the Tenant gave testimony she chose to
pay for other items instead of rent.
 
19.  I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find
that it would be prejudicial to the Landlord due to the large amount of
arrears, and unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1)
of the Act.




 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 6, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $4,865.66*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January
26, 2022, less the rent deposit
and interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $32.88 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 27, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount
owing* on or before February
6, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 7, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 6, 2022, then starting February
7, 2022, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 7, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlords or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$6,186.00 if the payment

31, 2022, or
ii)             
$7,186.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 6, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance
with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 7, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
