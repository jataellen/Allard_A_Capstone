Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-02330-18











 

XC (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict GC (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has been
persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination
date as well as administration charges related to NSF cheques.
 
This application was heard in Hamilton on March 1,
2018.
 
Only the Landlord attended the hearing. By 10:12 a.m., the Tenant did not attend the
hearing though properly served with the Notice of Hearing. 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant is still in
possession of the rental unit.
 
2.     
The tenancy started on May
1, 2017. 
 
3.     
The rent is due on the first
day of each month.
 
4.     
The Tenant paid the rent for
October on October 27th and has not paid any of the rent owing from
November 2017 to February 2018.
 
5.     
The Tenant has persistently
failed to pay the rent on the date it was due in accordance with the N8 Notice
of Termination dated January 24, 2018, which is the termination notice that was
served on the Tenant, though by way of clerical error the Landlord filed a
largely blank termination notice with the Board.
 
6.     
The Landlord incurred
charges of $60.00 for administration charges related to cheques tendered by or
on behalf of the Tenant, which were returned NSF. The Landlord collected a rent
deposit of $2,000.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by
the Landlord.
 
7.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 28, 2017 to April 30, 2018
 
8.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. Specifically, the
Landlord testified that she has been extremely financially prejudiced by the
Tenant’s failure to pay rent. The Landlord is a student and relies on this
income to pay for her tuition, living expenses and mortgage. As well, I am
mindful that this has not been a long term tenancy, such that this spate of
late payment could be seen as an anomaly in an otherwise extensive and unblemished
tenure. I am also mindful that the Tenant is in significant arrears of rent. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated, as of April 30,
2018. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before April 30, 2018.
 
2.     
As of the date of this
order, the amount the Landlord is holding for the rent deposit and the interest
owing on the deposit exceeds the amount the Tenant owes for compensation and
the total charges related to NSF cheques tendered to the Landlord by or on
behalf of the Tenant  by $1,976.29.
 
3.     
The Landlord is authorized
to offset from the amount the Landlord owes the Tenant the following amounts:
$65.75 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from May 1, 2018 to the
date the Tenant moves out of the unit; and $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
4.     
The Landlord or the Tenant
may collect from the other any money that becomes owing as a result of this
order. 
 
5.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before April 30, 2018, then starting May 1, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
6.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after May 1, 2018.
