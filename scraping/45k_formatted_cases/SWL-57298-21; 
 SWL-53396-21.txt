Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57298-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


304, 160 EMERY
STREET W LONDON ON N6J3W3


 




Between:


Mantler Management Ltd


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kaily
  Mackay


Tenant



 
 
 
Mantler Management Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Kaily Mackay (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent
the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the
order issued by the Board on October 28, 2021 with respect to application
SWL-53396-21/ SWL-53397-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant
has not met the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenant failed to pay the lawful
monthly rent in full on or before
November 1, 2021. The
Tenant failed to pay $699.00 towards the arrears on or before November 13,
2021.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $1,566.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's
application fee in Order SWL-53396-21/ SWL-53397-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $867.80 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order SWL-53396-21/
SWL-53397-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed
to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from November 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.




 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $699.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit has been paid to the Tenant up to December
31, 2020. There is no further interest owing since
there was no guideline rent increase allowed (consequently no interest) in 2021
due to COVID19.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order SWL-53396-21/ SWL-53397-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 17, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord $1,704.68*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 6, 2022 and the costs
related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $22.98
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 7, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before
January 17, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
January 18, 2022 at .00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January
18, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 18, 2022.

The tenant has until January 16, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 16, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on July 18, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction
where the rental unit is located.
