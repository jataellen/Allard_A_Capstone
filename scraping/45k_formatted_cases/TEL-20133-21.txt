Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-20133-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


UPSTAIRS APARTMENT, 21 BRIDGE ST W
  CAMPBELLFORD ON K0L1L0


 




Between:


2471451 Ontario Corp.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Aleesa Partridge


Tenant



 
 
 
2471451 Ontario Corp. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Aleesa Partridge (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in
the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or
another tenant.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on January
25, 2022. The Landlord
Artif Khan, and the Tenant, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord’s N5 notice required the Tenant to pay
$5,000.00 to repair the damage claimed in the notice. The Landlord did not request
any compensation for damage in his
application. At the hearing the
Landlord testified he is not pursuing the cost of damage as a part of his
application.
 
2.    
The Landlord acknowledged that all of the issues
with the exception
of water damage have been resolved by the Tenant.
 
3.     The Tenant’s rental unit is located above a commercial
space owned by the Landlord. When the Landlord
was at the commercial location, he discovered there was a leak in the
ceiling which caused the ceiling
tiles to fall and the carpet was wet. The Landlord went to
the Tenant’s unit to investigate. The Landlord claims
the faucet on the Tenant’s sink was broken off from it’s mount and was
hanging into the sink.
 
4.     The Tenant denied that the faucet was broken and hanging and testified she had no idea
there had been a leak. The Tenant
testified that the plumber told her there was a problem with the drain.
 
5.     The Landlord’s evidence shows a photograph of the
under side of the sink. No
photographs of a damaged or broken faucet
hanging into the sink was provided.

6.     The Tenant’s evidence
shows that a plumber was contacted by the Tenant
and that work was done on the drain, at a cost of
$129.75.
 
7.     I find there is insufficient evidence to conclude
the Tenant wilfully
or negligently caused damage to the rental unit or
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
