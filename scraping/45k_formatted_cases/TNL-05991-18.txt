Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-05991-18










 



 


 


 



 

OPG
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict JC
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes
(‘L1 application’); and because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying
the Tenant's rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date (‘L2 application’).
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on August 1, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord’s counsel, MZ attended the hearing. There was no
record before me of a request to adjourn and I was satisfied that the parties
had proper notice of the hearing.  After waiting more than 30 minutes, I
proceeded to determine the application on the basis of the materials before me
and submissions from the Landlord.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from May 1, 2018 to August 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective May 21, 2018.
2.     This
is a monthly tenancy, and rent is due on the first day of each month.  The
evidence before me reveals that the Tenant has not paid the full rent when due in
12 of the 12 months during the period from July, 2017 to June, 2018, both
inclusive.  I am satisfied that the Tenant has been persistently late in the
payment of rent.
3.     The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,565.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
4.     Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2018
to May 21, 2018.
5.     The
Tenant paid $300.00 after the application was filed.
6.     No
circumstances were disclosed to me to support relief from eviction in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, (2006)
(the ‘Act’).
It is ordered that:
 
L1 Application for Non-payment of Rent
 
1.     Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before August 14, 2018. However, even if the Tenant voids the part of
this eviction order that relates to non-payment of rent, the tenancy will be
terminated as of August 31, 2018 for the Tenant’s persistent late payment of
rent.
2.     The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,746.90*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to August 3, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $51.45 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting August 4, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.     The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.     If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before August
14, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from August 15, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     If
the unit is not vacated on or before August 14, 2018, then starting August 15,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after August 15,
2018.
8.     If,
on or before August 14, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $4,885.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated for non-payment of rent and the
Tenant could remain in the unit until August 31, 2018.  If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.  However,
the tenancy will still be terminated as of August 31, 2018 for the Tenant’s
persistent late payment of rent.
9.     The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order for eviction for non-payment of rent if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after August 15, 2018 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to
make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.  However, the tenancy will still be terminated as of August 31, 2018
for the Tenant’s persistent late payment of rent.
L2 Application for Persistent Late Payment of Rent
 
10.   Even
if the Tenant voids the part of this eviction order for non-payment of rent,
the tenancy will still be terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before August 31, 2018.
 
11.   If
the unit is not vacated on or before August 31, 2018, then starting September
1, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
12.   Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after September 1,
2018.
