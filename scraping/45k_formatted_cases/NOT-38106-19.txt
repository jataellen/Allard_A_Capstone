Order under Section 31
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOT-38106-19
 
 
 
 
EA (the 'Tenant') applied for an order determining that RVPI, HD and JD (the
'Landlords') harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with the
Tenant and substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental
unit or residential complex by the Tenant or by a member of the Tenant's
household.
 
This application was heard on June 17, 2021 in VC75 and on July 22, 2021 in Passcode 215 965
491 VC 75. Only the Tenant assisted by (‘AB-S’), attended the hearing
on June 16, 2021. Only the Tenant,
assisted by AB-S, attended the hearing on July 22, 2021.
 
This application is one of 16
related tenant applications against the Landlords concerning the effective shut down of a mobile
home park (the ‘Park’)
and certain maintenance and repair issues leading up to the time of the
effective shut down.
 
Refer to order NOT-33990-18-HR (the ‘Base Order’)
issued February 1, 2022, concurrently with this and the other 14 related individual Tenant
applications. That order sets out my
determinations on the liability of the Landlords pertaining to events
leading up to the Park’s closure and the availability of
remedies related to the closure itself.
 
The application under file number NOT-33990-18 was a multi-tenant T2 application brought on behalf
of fifteen tenants
identified in Schedule
1 to that order (‘Park
Tenants’), seeking relief
for the discontinuance of power to the Park. A separate T6 application and/or T2 application was brought by
each of the fifteen Park Tenants, seeking relief for the Landlords’ actions and
inactions pertaining to the Park’s water supply, the Park’s sewage system and
the effective closure of the Park. This application under file NOT-38106-19 is
one of those applications.
 
The hearing of issues common to
all of the applications, meaning common to the application under file number NOT-33990-18 and the fifteen
individual applications, proceeded
to completion on July 22,
2022 in Passcode 215 965 491 VC 75 following a number of earlier appearances.




 
The hearing of the Tenant’s individual issues under file number NOT-38106-19 proceeded on June
17, 2019. The procedural history is set out in the Base Order.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
As set out in the Base Order, I find that that:
 
a)     The Landlords withheld
or interfered with the provision
of electricity, a vital service;
 
b)     The Landlords failed
to repair or maintain the Park’s sewage
system, allowing problems with sewage discharges and
significant odours over a period that extends back prior to one year prior to
the Tenant’s application filing in September 2019;
 
c)     
The Landlords failed to repair or maintain the Park’s water
system such that the supply of potable water was compromised
for roughly two weeks at the beginning of March 2018 and throughout the period
June through October 2018;
 
d)    
The Landlords’ failures substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
of the units and the Park by
the Tenants, both prior to and after October 2018; and
 
e)     The above failures, combined with the Landlords’
decision to cease providing all services at the Park as of October
2018, attract various
remedies, some pertaining to events leading up to the October 2018 effective closure and
pertaining to events following that effective closure.
 
2.   
The Tenant claims for those costs attributable to the Park’s
closure.
 
3.    I find the following facts on the basis of the uncontroverted testimony of the Tenant
and, where indicated, my review of materials provided at Tab E of the Tenant’s
productions;
 
a)     The Tenant lived at the Park for many years before he vacated in April 2019;
 
b)    
The Tenant lived in the lower portion of the Park and was particularly affected by the sewage problems at the Park;
 
c)      The Tenant incurred
the following out of pocket
expenses during his six
month stay at the Park following the October 2018
closure:
 
(i)                
$150.83 for fuel for his generator
(refer Tab E-6 of the Tenant’s productions);
 
(ii)               
$420.00 for propane (refer
Tab E-6 of the Tenant’s
productions); and
 
(iii)             
$140.00 for water.
 
d)    
The Tenant incurred $249.95
for moving costs (refer Tab E-6 of the Tenant’s productions).




 
 
 
4.   
As set out in the Base Order, I find the following:
 
a)     The Tenant is not entitled
to compensation for the loss of value of the mobile home;
 
b)     The Tenant is entitled to compensation for his reasonable out of pocket
expenses during his continued stay at the Park; and
 
c)     
The Tenant may be entitled to damages for interference with reasonable enjoyment.
 
5.    The Tenant is entitled to compensation
in the amount of $710.00
for out of pocket costs of
his continued stay at the Park.
 
6.    I find that the Tenant is entitled to damages for
interference with reasonable enjoyment. I find
that it is likely that the Tenant suffered difficulties during the time he stayed in
the Park without power or
water. I find that damages of
$1,000.00 is appropriate in the circumstances.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlords shall pay to the Tenant a total of $1,960.78, representing payment for the following:
 
a)     $710.83 for his out of pocket costs to stay at the Park;
 
b)     $249.95 for costs of moving;
and
 
c)     
$1,000.00 for damages.
 
2.    
The Landlords shall pay the Tenant the full amount owing by March 31, 2022.
 
3.    
If the Landlords do not pay the
Tenant the full amount owing by March 31, 2022 the Landlords will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from April 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
