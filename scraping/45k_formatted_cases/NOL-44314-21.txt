Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44314-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


A, 6 BROCK CRESCENT KAPUSKASING ON P5N2J8


 




Between:


Melanie Villeneuve Ron Villeneuve


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Diane Poisson


Tenant



 
 
 
Melanie Villeneuve and Ron
Villeneuve (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Diane
Poisson (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 27, 2022. Only the Landlords attended the hearing. As of 2:50 p.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The notice
of termination which
was filed in support of the Landlord’s application, has a stated termination date of October 14,
2021.
 
2.    
The certificate of service completed by the Landlord
states that the notice was served to the Tenant by handing the documents
directly to them on October 14, 2021.
 
3.    
As the termination date of the notice is the same date as when the notice was served the Tenant has not been provided an
opportunity to correct the notice as is required by the Residential Tenancies
Act.
 
4.    
As a result, the Landlord’s notice
of termination is flawed, and the application cannot move forward.




File Number: NOL-44314-21
