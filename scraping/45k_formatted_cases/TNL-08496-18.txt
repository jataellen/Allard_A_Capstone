            Order
under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-08496-18
 



 


 


 



 
 
PJ
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict DRK
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on October 9, 2018.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s representative ES, and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
At the hearing (PW) who is an employee of the Landlord, gave
evidence with the assistance of an interpreter. The Tenant also gave evidence
at the hearing.
 
 Determinations:
 
1.      The
rental unit is a room in a rooming house. The monthly rent is $750.00. There is
no written tenancy agreement. 
 
2.      The
tenancy began on June 1, 2018. The Tenant paid first and last month rent at the
outset of the tenancy. The Landlord also collected a $500.00 “security deposit”
which is not permitted by the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and which must be credited to the rent owed by the Tenant to the
Landlord.
 
3.      The
Tenant paid the rent for the month of July 2018. The Landlord claims that the
Tenant has paid no rent for the months of August, September or October 2018.
 
4.      The
Tenant claims that he gave $1,590.00 in cash to PW on the 3rd or 4th
of September 2018, but did not get a receipt from her. Although the Tenant
claimed that he had a witness to this event, the witness was not at the hearing
to give evidence.
 
5.      PW
is an employee of the Landlord who is responsible for cleaning the common areas
of the residential complex. She collects the garbage on Monday each week and
cleans the common areas including the kitchen, hallway and sunroom on Tuesday
each week. She sometimes cleans the bathroom on the first floor as well, but
generally the tenants are responsible for cleaning the bathrooms themselves.
 
6.      PW
was at the residential complex on the evening of Monday September 3, 2018 to
collect the garbage and on Tuesday September 4, 2018 to clean the common areas.
She could not remember the specific time that she attended on September 4 but
believed it was late in the afternoon.
 
7.      PW
denied the Tenant’s assertion that he gave her money for rent. PW was not
instructed by the Landlord to collect money from the Tenant nor did she receive
any money from him.
 
8.      During
the more than one year that PW has been employed by the Landlord she has been
asked by the Landlord to collect money from tenants about 4 or 5 times. In June
2018 she was asked to collect $200.00 from the tenant of Room #4, and on 
August 31, 2018 she was asked to collect $600.00 from the tenant of Room #6. On
each of these occasions she collected the money as requested by the Landlord
and delivered the money to the Landlord. She was not instructed to, nor did she
ever, collect money from the Tenant.
 
9.      I
accept the evidence of PW. The Tenant did not ask her any questions or
challenge her evidence at the hearing (except as to the time of day she
attended on September 4, when he asserts she came in the early evening to
clean).
 
10.   The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from August 1, 2018 to October 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination.
 
11.   The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $750.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
12.   Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 31, 2018 to
October 10, 2018.
 
13.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1)
of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before October 21, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $491.66*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to October 10, 2018, after deducting the rent deposit
and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit, and the “security deposit”.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $24.66 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting October 11, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
October 21, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from October 22, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before October 21, 2018, then starting October
22, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after October 22,
2018.
 
8.      If,
on or before October 21, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $1,940.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after October 22, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
