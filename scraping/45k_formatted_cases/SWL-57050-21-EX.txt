Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57050-21-EX
 
 



In the matter
of:


114, 84 OAKVILLE AVENUE LONDON ON N5V2S5


 




Between:


Amiraco Properties Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Wayne
Oliver


Tenant



 
 
 
Amiraco Properties Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Wayne Oliver (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in
the order issued by the Board on October 1, 2021 with respect to application
SWL-54011-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.   
I find that the Tenant has not met the following condition specified in the order: The Tenant
failed to pay the lawful monthly rent on or before November 1, 2021.
 
3.   
Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed
to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from October 1, 2021 to
November 30, 2021.
 
4.   
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $810.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.   
Interest on the rent deposit has been paid to the Tenant up to December
31, 2020, which is included in this order. There is
no further interest owing since there was no guideline rent increase allowed
(consequently no interest) in 2021 due to COVID19.
 
 
It is
ordered that:




File Number: SWL-57050-21-EX
 
1.   
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 15, 2022.
 
2.   
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $710.93*. This amount
represents the rent owing up to January 4, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.   
The Tenant
shall also pay to
the Landlord $26.97 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 5, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.   
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
15, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
5.   
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.   
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord on or after January 16, 2022.

The tenant has until January 14, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 14, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.
