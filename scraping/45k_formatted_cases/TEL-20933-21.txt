Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-20933-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


12457
HWY 62
CENTRE HASTINGS (MADOC) ON K0K2K0


 




Between:


Rodney Hallett


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Carter Laws Charlie Unknown Jacob Belland


Tenants



 
 
 
Rodney Hallett
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Carter Laws, Charlie Unknown and Jacob
Belland (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on January 7, 2022 at 1:00 p.m.
 
Only the Landlord, Rodney Hallett,
attended the hearing. The Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
though being properly
served with the Notice of Hearing by the Board.
The hearing
proceeded without the Tenants at 4:19 p.m.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The application is dismissed because the
Landlord did not pay the Tenants the compensation required for this application under
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the “Act”).
 
2.    
The Landlord
served the Tenants
an N12 Notice of Termination under section 48 of the Act because he wants to move into the
rental unit.
 
3.    
Section 48.1 of the Act
states that, “a landlord shall compensate a tenant in the amount equal to one month’s
rent or offer the tenant another rental
unit acceptable to the tenant if
the landlord gives the tenant a notice of termination of the tenancy under
section 48”.
 
4.    
Section 55.1 of the Act
requires that compensation under section 48.1 be paid to the tenant no later
than on the termination date specified in the notice of termination. In the
present case, the termination date in the N12 Notice
of Termination is January 31, 2022.

5.    
At the hearing (held
prior to the termination date in the N12 Notice), the Landlord was unable to confirm that he did not pay the Tenants
any compensation under section 48.1. Therefore, I find that the Landlord
has not satisfied a statutory requirement for this application and the
application must therefore be dismissed.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord's application is dismissed.
