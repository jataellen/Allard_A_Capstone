Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57565-22
 
 



In the
  matter of:


207, 100 OLD CARRIAGE DRIVE KITCHENER ON N2P1Z3


 




Between:


Equiton Residential Income Fund LP


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Janiel Beckford


Tenant



 
 
 
Equiton Residential Income Fund LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict
Janiel Beckford (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on
November 25, 2021 with respect to application SWL-53752-21.
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following condition
specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $2,631.89
arrears in full on or before December 31, 2021.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $2,631.89 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
SWL-53752-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $2,224.70
and that amount is included
in this order.
As a result, the previous order SWL-53752-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $637.60
from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.




 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from January 1, 2022 to
January 24, 2022.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.     Order SWL-53752-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 4, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
pay to the Landlord $1,448.79*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 24, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $21.55 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 25, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 4, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
February 5, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 4, 2022, then starting February
5, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 5, 2022.
 
 
January 24, 2022

The tenant has until February 3, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by February 3, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction

has not been filed on or before

Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
