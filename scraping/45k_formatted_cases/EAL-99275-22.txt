Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-99275-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


306, 851 RICHMOND ROAD OTTAWA ON K2A3X2


 




Between:


Homestead Land Holdings Limited


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Afaf-sami Abu-Ghanem


Tenant



 
 
 
Homestead Land Holdings Limited
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Afaf-sami Abu-Ghanem (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on
January 18, 2022 with respect to application EAL-97623-21.
 
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following condition specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $800.00 arrears
on or before January 14, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $6,237.79 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order EAL-97623-21. The amount that is still owing from that
order is $6,237.79 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order EAL-97623-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from February 1, 2022 to February 28, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,007.15 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 1, 2021 to February 8, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order EAL-97623-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 19, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,459.60*. (less
any amount paid since the application was filed January 25, 2022.)This amount
represents the rent owing up to February 8, 2022 and the costs related
to the application fee for the previous
application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$28.62 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 9, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
19, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 20, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 19, 2022, then starting
February 20, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 20, 2022.
 
 
February 8, 2022                                                                                 Date Issued                                                                       Kimberly

The tenant has until February 18, 2022
to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by February 18, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.
