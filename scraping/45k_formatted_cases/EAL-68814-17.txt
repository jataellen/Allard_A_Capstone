D.R.I.T.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Z.M.
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes and
has been persistently late in paying the rent.
 
This
application was heard in Ottawa on December 12, 2017.
 
Only
the Landlord’s representative, A.L. M, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
THE
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from August 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October 11, 2017.
2.      The
Tenant paid $4,125.00 after the application was filed.
3.      The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending December 31, 2017 total $100.22.
4.      The
Landlord incurred costs of $190.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
5.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,046.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
6.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from August 1, 2014
to October 11, 2017 totalling $56.52.
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Board’s standard voidable eviction order shall
issue with respect to the application for non-payment of rent. 
THE
APPLICATION FOR PERSISTENT LATE PAYMENT
8.      The
Tenant has been persistently late paying the rent.
9.      The
tenancy is a month to month tenancy.
10.   The
Landlord asks that an order issue granting the Tenant conditional relief under
section 83 of the Act if the Tenant voids the eviction order for non-payment by
paying all of the rent arrears and costs currently owing. Given this submission
of the Landlord I find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from
eviction subject to  the conditions set out in this order pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
It is
ordered that:
THE
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated for non-payment of rent.  The Tenant must move out
of the rental unit on or before January 2, 2018.
2.      As
of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation
the Landlord is entitled to by $1,356.88*.
3.      However,
the Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the
Landlord owes the Tenant:
$34.58 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting December 21,
2017 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit, and
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
4.      The
Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as
a result of this order.
5.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before January 2, 2018, then starting January 3,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
6.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 3,
2018.
7.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $290.22 if the payment is made on or before December 31, 2017, or
ii)       $1,342.08 if the payment is made on or before January 2, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after January 3, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
THE
APPLICATION FOR PERSISTENT LATE PAYMENT OF RENT
9.      If
the Tenant voids the eviction order above pursuant to paragraph 7 or 8 of this
order then:
(1)  The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord new rent on time and in full as it comes due
and owing for the period January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018. 
(2)  If the
Tenant fails to make any one of the payments in accordance with paragraph 9(1)
of this order, the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to the
Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenant and requiring that the Tenant pay any new arrears, NSF
fees and related charges that became owing after December 31, 2017.
