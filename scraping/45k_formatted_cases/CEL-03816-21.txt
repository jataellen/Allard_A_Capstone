Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-03816-21
 
 
In the matter
of:      BASEMENT,
15 GARSIDE CRESCENT
BRAMPTON ON L6S1H5
 




Between:                  Lilla Ganesh Harry Ganesh


Landlords




 
 
And
 
Sello Mashike                                                                                                                  Tenant
 
 
 
Lilla Ganesh and
Harry Ganesh (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Sello Mashike (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of
the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully
or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises. The Landlords has also applied for an
order requiring the Tenant to compensate the
Landlords for the damage; and
because the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit
for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard
by video conference on January
6, 2022. The Landlords and
the Tenant attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.     It is not disputed that the residential
complex is a duplex, the basement of which comprises the Tenant’s rental
unit and the ground floor of which comprises another rental unit occupied by another
tenant.
 
2.    
It is also undisputed
that the N12 notice of termination (the N12) that forms the basis of the application only lists the municipal address
of the complex, without particularizing the Tenant’s unit. I determined that the N12 is fatally
defective by failing to identify the unit in
accordance with section 43(1)(a) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
The application is dismissed without
consideration of it merits.
