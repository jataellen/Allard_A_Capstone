In the matter
of:


34 BLACK CHERRY
CRESCENT BARRIE ON L4N9L1


 




Between:


Black Cherry
Estates Inc


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Dawn Ramsay


Tenant



 
Black Cherry Estates Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Dawn Ramsay (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February
18, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s Agent, Kelly Fraser, and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
The Tenant declined the opportunity to speak with
Tenant Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
October 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October
20, 2021.
 
2.     The monthly rent was increased
effectively on January
1, 2022 to be become
$1,760.88
 
3.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,740.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
4.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from November 9, 2020
to October 20, 2021.
 
5.    
The Tenant paid $500.00
after the application was filed.
 
6.    
The Tenant did not dispute the
quantum owing, and provided an explanation, including circumstances,
surrounding the rent arrears she has come to owe. The Tenant stated that the matter
of arrears is mainly due to covid-19
impacting her employment (she works for at an
automobile plant) which has contributed to her inability to stay current with
her rents. The Tenant requested a
standard voidable order with an extended voiding date of 30 days.
 
7.     The Landlord’s Agent
objected to the extended voiding
date and instead
submitted her own arguments relating to the pattern of arrears under the
tenancy and despite having




File Number: CEL-04262-21
 
left several messages in the Tenant’s
mailbox to initiate
some discourse about
possible repayment, has received no reply from the Tenant. She requested
a standard 11-day order with an expedited Sheriff’s enforcement provision.
 
8.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.         I indicated to the parties present that
considering the time when I believe I would be able to issue this order, I
would issue a standard 11-day voidable order,
which would effectively meet both parties’
requests in respect
of the voiding date. I also indicated that I am refusing the
Landlord’s request for an expedited enforcement provision, as no substantive
reasons were given relating to arrears quantum, health, safety or other such
reasons, to justify the inclusion of such a provision.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 11, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $6,396.96*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
28, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $57.21
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting March 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before March 11,
2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
March 12, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 11, 2022, then starting
March 12, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 12, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant
must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$8,442.76 if the payment
is made on or before February 28, 2022, or
ii)             
$10,203.64 if the payment
is made on or before
March 11, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this
paragraph and by the appropriate
deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.

9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount

12, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
