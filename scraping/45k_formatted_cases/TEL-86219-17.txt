Landlord’s L1 application.
S.H.I.L.(the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict M.M. (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
Landlord’s L2 application.
S.H.I.L.(the 'Landlord') also
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict M.M. (the 'Tenant')
because she, another occupant of the rental unit or someone he permitted in the
residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the
premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to
compensate the Landlord for the damage. The Landlord also claimed compensation
for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
These applications were heard
in Toronto on July 10, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative B.R.
and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
It should be noted that for
reasons unknown the Tenant got very upset during the hearing and left the
hearing room. The Tenant was warned on her way out that the hearing would
continue without her.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
With respect to the
Landlord’s L1 application, the
Tenant has not paid the total rent he was required to pay for the period from
November 1, 2017 to July 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination effective November 19, 2017.
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $969.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by
the Landlord.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2017 to November 19,
2017.
4.     
The Tenant paid $3,962.07
after the application was filed.
5.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until August 10, 2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of
the Act.
6.     
With respect to the Landlord’s
L2 application, before the
Tenant left the hearing room she admitted that she had damaged the fire alarm
horn in her unit as it was making noise.
7.     
The Tenant should have
contacted the Landlord immediately for action on this rather than taking it
into her own hands.
8.     
As a result I have ordered
the Tenant to pay for the damages as proven by means of an invoice for the
damages in the amount of $450.87 however I have given the Tenant a second
chance to not do any further damage to the rental unit provided the rent gets
paid in full including the damages as per the order.
9.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
10.  
The Tenant has paid
$4,932.20 to the Board in trust since the application was filed. $1,972.88 of
it has been credited in this order and the remainder was sent to the Landlord
previously and is a part of the amount mentioned paid to the Landlord in
paragraph # 4. **
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before August
10, 2018.The amount of $1,972.88 plus accrued interest shall be paid out to the
Landlord.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $1,103.93*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to July 20, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $32.43 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
July 21, 2018 to the date she moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $450.87 in damages done to the fire alarm system.
6.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before August 10, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from August
11, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before August 10, 2018, then starting August 11, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after August 11, 2018.
 
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, she must pay to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust:
i)        $3,064.50 if the payment is made on or before July 31, 2018, or
ii)       $4,050.94 if the payment is made on or before August 10, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after August 11, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
 
10.  
If the Tenant voids this
order as in paragraph # 8 or # 9, then the Tenant will refrain from any causing
any damage to the rental unit or the rental complex up to and including August
10, 2019.
 
11.  
Failure to do as directed in
paragraph # 10 will allow the Landlord to apply to the board under Section 78
of the Residential Tenancies Act (2006), without notice to the Tenant,
for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord must
make this application no later than 30 days after the Tenant’s breach of the
paragraph.
 
12.  
The Board shall pay to the
Landlord the amount of $1,972.88 together with any accrued interest. **
