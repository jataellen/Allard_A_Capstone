Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19576-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


589 BEECHWOOD STREET OSHAWA ON L1G2S1


 




Between:


Aiysha Patel


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Arthur James
Sean
Katelyn Margaret Marilyn Mckenzie Marilyn Ducsharm


Tenants



 
 
 
Aiysha Patel (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Marilyn Ducsharm, Katelyn
Margaret Marilyn Mckenzie
and Arthur James Sean (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent
that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by way of
video conference on January 5, 2022. The Landlord’s legal representative Paul Balram and the
Tenants Arthur James Sean and Katelyn Margaret Marilyn Mckenzie attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective September 16, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,800.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
3.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from December
1, 2020 to September 16, 2021.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The parties agreed
that as of the
date of the hearing, the Tenants owe to the
Landlord
$16,986.00 which
consists of $16,800.00 in arrears of rent and the $186.00
application filing fee.




 
 
 
6.    
The Tenant Arthur James Sean testified
that during the summer of 2021 his work vehicle, his tools and equipment were stolen. The Tenant is a general
contractor and was unable
to work as a result of his work vehicle and tools being stolen. The Tenants filed no evidence to support
this allegation.
 
7.    
The Mr. Sean
stated that he has been back to work since the fall of 2021 but has been unable
to complete his desired number of projects as he has found it difficult to find
employees. The Tenant Katelyn
Margaret Marilyn Mckenzie is currently working part time. The total household income is currently $4,500.00 per month. The Tenants testified that in addition to their rent,
their monthly expenses total approximately $3,000.00.
 
8.     The Tenants proposed
a repayment plan in which they would pay their monthly
rent on time, plus an
additional $500.00 towards the rent arrears.
 
Relief from eviction:
 
9.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until February 28, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
10.  I am not granting the Tenants their requested
repayment plan because the arrears are substantial, and the Tenants have made
no payments to the Landlord in six months despite both Mr. Reid and Ms.
McKenzie working since the fall of 2021. Further,
the Tenants’ own evidence indicates that the Tenants cannot financially afford
the proposed repayment plan or payment of the current
monthly rent when factoring in all personal
and household expenses.
 
11.  However, I am mindful to the fact that the Tenants have 3 children
and as such, find that
delaying the termination date to February 28, 2022 would not be unfair to allow
the Tenants some additional time to find alternate housing.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$13,621.25*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 26, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $92.05
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 27, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.




 
 
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
28, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 28, 2022, then starting
March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$16,986.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$19,786.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022**.
If the Tenants
do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March 1, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
