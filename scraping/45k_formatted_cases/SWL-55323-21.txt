Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55323-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


3, 4 REAUME AVENUE WALLACEBURG ON N8A5A8


 




Between:


Wallaceburg Kinsmen
Court c/o Ursite


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Trisha Sands


Tenant



 
 
Wallaceburg Kinsmen Court c/o
Ursite (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Trisha
Sands (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 13, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Robert
Rose, attended the hearing.
As of 10:21 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent
the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from September 1, 2021 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 23, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $694.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant paid $2,776.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until January 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 31, 2022.

2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$257.18*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 21, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord
$22.82 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 22, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
31, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022, then starting February
1, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to
the Landlord, on or after February 1, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before January 31, 2022, the Tenant pays the
amount of $665.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for
eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain
in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
