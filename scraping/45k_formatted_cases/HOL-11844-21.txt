and


 




 


Catlin Zachary
  Evelyn Mihaly


Tenants



 
Roger Wei (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Evelyn
Mihaly and Catlin Zachary (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe. The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges
and related administration charges.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 14, 2022. Only
the Landlord attended the hearing. As of 9:48 a.m., the Tenants were not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from July 6, 2021 to September 5, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination effective August 20, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on November
10, 2021. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $3,000.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.    
The Tenants have made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
6.     The Landlord incurred
charges of $7.00 for a cheque tendered
by or on behalf of the
Tenants, which was returned NSF and $20.00 for related administration charges.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of November 10, 2021, the date the Tenants gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.

2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$12,594.11*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to November 10, 2021 and the total charges related to
a NSF cheque tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenants.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before March 8, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 9, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
