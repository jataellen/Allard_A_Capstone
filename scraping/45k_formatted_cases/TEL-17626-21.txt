Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-17626-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


3, 2041 VICTORIA PARK AVENUE
  SCARBOROUGH ON M1R1V4


 




Between:


Starlight Canadian Residential Growth Fund


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Natasha Lewis


Tenant



 
 
 
Starlight Canadian Residential
Growth Fund (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Natasha Lewis (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard in
Passcode: 926 3155 0221# on August 17, 2021.
The Landlord’s representative Matt Anderson,
and witnesses for the Landlord
Property Manager Heather
Trimble and Verity McGovern, attended the hearing. The Tenant was properly served and did not
attend by the time hearings concluded at 4:00pm.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord submitted multiple
email and complaints regrading the Tenant’s
behaviour. The witnesses testified that the Tenant can be highly unpredictable
and abusive toward staff and contractors. The Tenant submits false
maintenance requests where no
repairs are required. On other
occasions, the Landlord will make a repair and the Tenant will break the work
that has been completed.
 
2.     The Tenant has installed a second lock on the door without
the Landlord’s permission and will deny entry after
proper notice has been served for the Landlord to perform maintenance.
 
3.     The Landlord removed
patio stones from the common
area and the Tenant put them back without the Landlord’s approval.
 
4.     The Tenant makes
racist and condescending remarks to staff
and contractors and has
received multiple warnings about the issues described. The Landlord testified that




 
serving the N5 notice
was a last resort because
the behaviour has not changed.
As a result, the Landlord
cannot do their job properly.
 
5.     I find this conduct substantially interferes with a lawful right,
privilege or interest
of the Landlord.
 
6.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $2,514.30 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from January 1, 2021 to
June 30, 2021
 
8.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of February
13, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 13, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $15,421.67, which represents compensation for the use of the
unit from July 1, 2021 to February 2, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit. Any
amounts paid during the period shall be deducted for this amount ordered.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$82.66 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from February 3, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
February 13, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 14, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 13, 2022, then starting February
14, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 14, 2022.

In accordance with section 81 of

Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
