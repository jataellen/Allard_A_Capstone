Jasmin Rohrer Spencer Votour


Tenants



 
 
 
Homestead Land Holdings Limited
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Jasmin Rohrer and Spencer Votour
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the
rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 11, 2022. Only the Landlord’s representative, Briar Hurst,
attended the hearing. As of 10:23am,
the Tenants were not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 2, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
vacated the rental
unit on September 28, 2021.
The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,465.00.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,506.98 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from August
1, 2021 to September 2, 2021.




File Number: EAL-97640-21
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of September
28, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $1,646.37*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to September
28, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before
January 31, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 1,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
