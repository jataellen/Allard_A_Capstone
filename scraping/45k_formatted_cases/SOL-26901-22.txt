  matter of:


323, 27 LEASIDE DRIVE
ST CATHARINES ON L2M7X1


 




Between:


St Lawrence Village Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Marsha Furuya


Tenant



 
 
 
St Lawrence Village Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Marsha Furuya (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by
the Board on October 4, 2021 with respect to application SOL-11355-19.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order: On January 15, 2022 the Tenant failed
to bring the rental unit to a reasonable state of “ordinary” cleanliness. The
Tenant provided the Landlord with the following dates for removing the Tenants
belongings to storage or disposal January 4, 2022 and January 7, 2022 and January 11, 2022. The Landlord hired
a contractor on one-time
basis to remove the Tenants belongings on January 7, 2022 with proper notice
given to the Tenant on January 3, 2022 to enter on January 7, 2022. On January
7, 2022 the Landlord attended the unit
to carry out the Tenants belongings to storage or disposal. The Landlord found 5
large garbage bags and 3 broken empty boxes placed outside the Tenants rental
unit in the hall to be placed in storage. The Tenant did not allow Landlord to enter rental unit. On January 9, 2022 the Landlord served the Tenant
notice to enter the unit to carry out inspection of the rental unit. The
Landlord found the Tenant had not brought the rental unit to a reasonable state
of “ordinary” cleanliness. On January 28, 2022 the Landlord served the Tenant notice of
entry for January 29, 2022
for purpose of inspection of rental unit. On
January 29, 2022 the Tenant denied entry into the rental unit.
