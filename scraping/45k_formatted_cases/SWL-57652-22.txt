Between:

and


 




 


Jamie Thurlby


Tenant



 
 
 
Tri Sands Apartments Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Jamie Thurlby (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent
the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the
order issued by the Board on January 13, 2022 with respect to application
SWL-54382-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following condition(s) specified in the order: On January 19, 2022, while under proper
24 hour notice of pest control, the Tenant
refused access to rooms in the unit for treatment and inspection, and was not
prepared for pest control treatment.
 
3.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $369.59 from the
Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
4.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from August 1, 2018 to February 8, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SWL-54382-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 19, 2022.

3.    
As of the date of this order, the
Tenant owes no money to the Landlord because the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit
exceeds the that the Landlord is entitled to under this order by
$384.76.
 
4.     The Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenant:
$12.15 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 9,
2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit;
 
5.     The Landlord or the Tenant shall pay any amounts
that become owing as a result of this
order.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 19, 2022, then starting
February 20, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 20, 2022.

The tenant has until February 18, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by February 18, 2022 the order will be stayed and the Board will schedule a hearing.
