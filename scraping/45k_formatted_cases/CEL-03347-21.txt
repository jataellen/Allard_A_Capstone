Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-03347-21



In the matter
of:


231, 7170 DARCEL
AVENUE MISSISSAUGA ON L4T3T5


 




Between:


IMH Pool
XX


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Simone Johns


 
Tenant



 
 
IMH Pool XX (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Simone Johns (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video
conference on February 7, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal
Representative, Sara Mathew, attended the hearing. As of 3:28 p.m. the Tenant
was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
The application is amended
to reflect that the lawful
monthly rent is $2,218.45.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
September 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective September 29, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
3.    
The lawful monthly rent is $2,218.45.
4.    
The Tenant paid $7,815.72
after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,018.46 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with section 83 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19
on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenant, and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 25, 2022.
 
2.    
As of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit exceeds
the arrears of rent
and compensation the Landlord is entitled to by $678.33*.
 
3.     However, the Landlord
is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenant: $72.94 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 15, 2022 to the
date the Tenant
moves out of the unit,
and $186.00 for the cost of
filing the application.
 
4.    
The Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a
result of this order.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 25, 2022, then starting
February 26, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 26, 2022.
 
7.     If, on or before February 25, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $2,655.98** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction
will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and
the Tenant could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
8.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 26, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
