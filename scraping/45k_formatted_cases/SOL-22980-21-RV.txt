Review Order
 
 
Adnan Qureshi
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dean
Kovinic (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
This application was resolved by order SOL-22980-21 issued on December
21, 2021.
 
On December
22, 2021, the Landlord requested a review of the order and that the order be
stayed until the request to review the order is resolved.
 
On January 6,
2022, interim order SOL-22980-21 -IN was issued, staying the order issued on
December 21, 2021. The Landlord
alleged that they were not
reasonably able to participate in the proceeding.
 
The request
was heard by video conference on January 25, 2022. Only the Landlord
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
The Request
 
1.    
The Landlord
alleged that they were not reasonably able to participate in the original
proceedings of December 8, 2021, which resulted in order SOL-22980-21
dismissing the Landlord’s application.
2.     In support of the request to review
the order, the Landlord testified that on the date of the hearing, his mother was sick, and he was tasked with contacting a doctor for her care and
missed the hearing as a result.




File Number: SOL-22980-21

Based on the submissions made in
the request, I am satisfied that the Landlord was not reasonably able to
participate in the proceeding.
 
4.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on September
30, 2021. The Tenant was in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.

on December 21, 2022, is granted.
The order cannot be enforced.
 
2.    
The interim order issued
on January 6, 2022, is cancelled, and replaced with this order.

Tenant vacated the rental unit.
