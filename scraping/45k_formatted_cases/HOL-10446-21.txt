Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: HOL-10446-21
 



In the matter
of:


1011 BERYL
PRIVATE OTTAWA ON K1V2M4


 




Between:


Penelope Chandler


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Peter Naoufal


Tenant



 
Penelope Chandler (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Peter Naoufal (the 'Tenant') because
a) the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted
in the residential complex has
wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises.
The Landlord has also applied for
an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage
and compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after
the termination date.
This application was heard via video/teleconference on October
7, 2021.
Only the Landlord attended the
hearing. As of 12:45 p.m., the Tenant
was not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
Preliminary matter:
At the hearing the Landlord’s Agent advised that the Tenant vacated
and moved out of the rental
unit on or about July 31, 2021.
 
Determinations:
1.    
The Tenant is no longer an occupant of the unit and the Landlord’s application to end the tenancy and evict the Tenant is
therefore moot.
 
Damages
 
2.     The Tenant was still in possession of the rental
unit as of the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The L2 application filed by the Landlord with the
Board also claims that the Tenant or another
occupant of the rental unit has wilfully
or negligently caused undue damage to
the rental unit or residential complex.
 
4.    
The Landlord states that he has incurred or will incur costs of $1,619.94 to repair the damage and/or replace property that
was damaged and cannot be repaired.




 
5.    
Section 89 (1) of the Act
provides, that a landlord may apply to the Board for an order requiring a
tenant to pay reasonable costs that the landlord has incurred or will incur for
the repair of or, where
repairing is not reasonable, the replacement of damaged property, if the tenant, another occupant
of the rental unit or a person whom the tenant permits in the residential
complex wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to the rental unit or the
residential complex.
 
6.    
This wording means that a landlord
must establish that it is more likely
than not that the
tenant, an occupant or a guest, wilfully or negligently caused each item of the
property damage claimed.
 
7.     On any application before the Board,
the party making
an allegation in an application has the onus of proving those allegations on a balance of
probabilities.
 
8.     The standard of proof requires the party to show with
evidence that, “more likely than not”, their assertions are true and that evidence “must be sufficiently clear,
convincing and cogent to satisfy the balance of probabilities test.”
 
9.     The Landlord submitted a number of photographs of the claimed
damage and estimates for the
cost to replace the damaged property totalling $1,619.94.
 
10.  The Tenant did not attend
the hearing to make submissions.
 
11.  I reviewed the Landlord’s documents submitted and I am
satisfied based on the uncontested testimony of the Landlord, on a balance of probabilities,
the Tenant, or another occupant of the rental
unit or someone she permitted in the residential complex has caused undue damage to the premises and the Landlord
has incurred or will incur costs of $900.00 to repair the damage and/or replace
property that was damaged and cannot be reasonably repaired.
 
12.  This order contains
all the reason for the decision within
the order. No other reasons
will be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $900.00 which represents the reasonable costs
of repairing the damage and/or replacing the damaged property.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay the total amount owing** to the Landlord
on or before February 28, 2022.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February
28, 2022, he will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.




 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
28, 2022, the Landlord has the right anytime after March 1, 2022 to
collect from the Tenant the amount owing or any outstanding balance as a result
of this order.
