Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: TNL-35355-21
 



In the
  matter of:


212, 100 ARBORS LANE WOODBRIDGE ON L4L7G4


 




Between:


O. Morell
Homes Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Abdul-Rahim Bangura
  William Panton


Tenants



 
 
O. Morell Homes Ltd. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict William Panton
and Abdul-Rahim Bangura
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the
rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 10, 2022. Only the Landlord,
Onorio Morelli and the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Jeff Shabes,
attended the hearing. As of 9:56 a.m., the Tenants were not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective January 16, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent is $2225.00.
 
4.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $2,200.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from July 1, 2020 to
January 16, 2022.
 
6.    
The Tenants paid $10,385.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenants, and find that it would
not be unfair to postpone
the eviction until March 15, 2022
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




File Number: TNL-35355-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below, the
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 15, 2022.
 
2.    
As of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the
Landlord is entitled to by $2,342.83*.
 
3.     However, the Landlord
is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount the
Landlord owes the Tenants:
$73.15 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
February 19, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the
unit, and
$186.00 for
the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
The Landlord or the Tenants shall pay to the other
any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 15, 2022, then starting
March 16, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 16, 2022.
 
7.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)      $911.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022, or
ii)     $3,136.00 if the payment is made on or before March
15, 2022**.
If the
Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after March 16, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
