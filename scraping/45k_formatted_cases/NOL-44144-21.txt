Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44144-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


2688 BIDWELL ROAD MANITOWANING ON P0P1N0


 




Between:


Karen Gerrard Thomas Shortt


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Bryan Levert Sarah Bryenton


Tenants



 
 
 
Karen Gerrard and Thomas Shortt
(the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Bryan Levert and Sarah Bryenton (the 'Tenants') because they have been
persistently late in paying their rent.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 988 4914 7021# on January
10, 2022. The Landlord
Karen Gerrard, and The Tenants, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlords and The Tenants
entered into a fixed term tenancy with monthly rent set at
$1,000.00. When the agreement reached the end of its
term the parties signed a new fixed term
lease at $1,250.00 per month.
In March 2022 there is to be a new fixed term agreement with the rent set at
$1,500.00.
 
2.    
The notice to terminate
the tenancy is based on late payment
of rent with the higher amount.
 
3.    
Part V of the Residential Tenancies Act speaks to Security of Tenure and Termination of Tenancies. Section 38 states that when a fixed term agreement ends and has
not been renewed or terminated, the landlord and the tenant shall be deemed to
have renewed it as a monthly tenancy agreement containing the same terms and
conditions.
 
4.    
As a tenancy can only be terminated in compliance with the Act, the tenancy in this case was not terminated.
As such the tenancy continues on a month to month basis with the same terms. Specifically, the rent continues
to be $1,000.00 without a notice to increase
the rent in compliance with the Act.




File Number: NOL-44144-21
 
5.    
Section 121 of the Act provides
that parties may agree to increase the rent, but the
increase is limited to 3% based on the provisions as set out in this section.
 
6.    
Because there was no
notice to terminate the tenancy, order by the Board, or notice by The Tenants
to terminate the tenancy, the tenancy is deemed to have continued
with the same conditions.
 
7.    
Entering into a new tenancy agreement to increase the rent is not in compliance with the
Act.
 
8.    
Because the amount of rent claimed
as not being paid on time in the notice served on the
Tenants is not accurate, I find the notice is defective and the tenancy cannot
be terminated based on the notice served.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlords' application is dismissed.
