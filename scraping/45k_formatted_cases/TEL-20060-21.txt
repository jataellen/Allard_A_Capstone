Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-20060-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


207, 560 BLOOR
STREET E OSHAWA ON L1H3N2


 




Between:


Property Trust
Ltd


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Barry Kane


Tenant



 
 
 
Property Trust Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Barry Kane (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on January 18, 2022.
 
Only Roger Kanthiah, the Landlord and owner of the company, attended the hearing. As of 12:08 p.m., the Tenant was not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
Based on the particulars contained
in the N8 Notice of Eviction served to the Tenant on July 21,2021,
I find that from October
2020 to July 21, 2021, the Tenant was late paying
their rent every month of the 10-month period.
 
2.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $806.24 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
3.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period from January 1, 2020.
 
4.     The Landlord testified that since the application was
filed the Tenant paid October and November 2020 and January 2022 late, and did
not pay December 2020 rent; she now owes approximately $1,381.13 in rental
arrears. There is an upcoming rent increase of 1.2% starting in February. Due to the persistently late payments, and that the Tenant
has not altered this behaviour, he is seeking termination within 11 days from
the date of the order and the application filing fee.
 
5.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Landlord is not aware of




File Number: TEL-20060-21
 
any reasons to delay or deny the
eviction and the Tenant did not attend to present any considerations. Further,
based on the uncontested evidence, the Tenant has continued to pay rent late since the application
was filed and owes arrears of rent.
 
6.     This order contains
all the reasons
for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
February 6, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 6, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February
6, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 7, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 6,
2022, 2021, then starting February 7, 2022,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction
may be enforced.
 
5.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 7, 2022.
