Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number: NOL-43240-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
661 CLOVERVALLEY ROAD MANITOWANING
ON P0P1N0


 




Between:


Joseph Albrecht


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


David Clare


Tenant



 
 
 
Joseph Albrecht (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict David Clare (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on August 19, 2021.
The Landlord, the Landlord's Legal
Representative, Kyle McGraw, and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Board grants
the Landlord’s request
to amend the application to the correct municipality of the rental unit to
Manitowaning. The Tenant did not contest the amendment and there was no
prejudice to granting the amendment.
 
2.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
October 1, 2020 to August 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective April 9,
2021.
 
3.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
Lawful rent
 
4.    
The Landlord purchased the property and inherited the tenancy. According to the signed lease agreement between the Tenant
and his previous landlords, the “Base rent” is
$1,226.40 due on the 1st and 15th of the month
in equal instalments of $613.20. The Tenant asserts that the rent is $600.00
monthly and that he only signed the lease because the previous landlords wanted to show more income.
However, it was always
the understanding between him and the previous landlords that the monthly rent
is
$600.00.

5.    
On any application before the
Board, the person who alleges any particular incident or event occurred
has the burden
of leading sufficient evidence to establish
that it is more likely than
not that their version of events is true.
 
6.     The Tenant provided
insufficient evidence to prove his assertion. I do not find the fact that that Tenant historically paid $600.00
monthly to be determinative on the issue. The previous landlords were not
present at the hearing to testify as to the true substance of their
transaction. The Tenant did not provide a reasonable explanation for failing to
call the previous landlords as witnesses. I denied the Tenant’s adjournment
request to summons the previous landlords because the Board is required to be
expeditious while affording parties adequate opportunities to know the issues
and be heard on the matter (s. 184 of the Act). The parties were previously
before the Board on August 19, 2021. Duty Counsel was available
at the previous hearing. The matter was adjourned for lack of time. In my view, the Tenant had ample
time to obtain legal advice and summons the previous landlords.
 
7.    
The best evidence
before me on the issue of the lawful rent is the lease agreement. Accordingly, I find that the lawful
monthly rent is $1,226.40 due on the 1st and 15th of the month in
equal instalments of $613.20.
 
8.    
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
 
9.     The Tenant paid $5,426.42 after the application was filed.
 
10.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until
February 15, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. Although the Landlord did not attempt
to negotiate a payment agreement with the Tenant, I find that negotiations would be
futile because the Tenant disputes the monthly rent amount. The Tenant stated
he cannot afford the monthly rent, so the tenancy is not viable. However, the
Tenant has made payments to the Landlord since this application was filed.
Postponing the eviction will allow the Tenant time to arrange for alternate housing.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 15, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$13,495.42*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 27, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $40.32
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 28, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.

5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 15, 2022, then starting
February 16, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 16, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$13,783.78 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022,
or
ii)             
$15,010.18 if the payment
is made on or before
February 15, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 16, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
