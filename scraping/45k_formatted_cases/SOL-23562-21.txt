Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-23562-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


802, 355 MELVIN
AVENUE HAMILTON ON L8H2K9


 




Between:


Redhill Tower


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Melinda
Gulyas


Tenant



 
 
Redhill Tower (the 'Landlord') applied for an order requiring Melinda Gulyas (the 'Tenant') to pay
compensation for the damages caused by the Tenant or a person the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 10, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord’s Representative J. Kay attended
the hearing. The Tenant did not attend, although properly served with the
notice of hearing from the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant was still in possession of the rental
unit as of the date the application was filed, however the Tenant has since vacated the rental unit.
 
2.     The Landlord’s application seeks $850.00 in damages from the Tenant.
 
3.     Section 89 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the “Act”) allows a
landlord to apply to the Board for an order requiring a tenant
to pay reasonable costs that the landlord has incurred or will incur for the
repair of, or where repairing is not reasonable, the replacement of damaged property, if the tenant, another occupant
of the rental unit or a person whom the tenant permits in the residential
complex wilfully or negligently causes undue
damage to the rental unit or the residential complex and the tenant is
in possession of the rental unit. To succeed in its application, the Landlord
must show that the damage is “undue”, meaning it is beyond normal wear and
tear, and considered to be excessive or unnecessary.
 
4.     The Landlord inspected the rental unit on
July 22, 2021 and produced before and after pictures comparing the condition of
the unit prior to the Tenant taking possession in early 2020 up to July 22,
2021.




 
Paint
 
5.    
The Landlord seeks
$350.00 in order to repaint the walls, as well as $50 to replace two light
fixtures in the kitchen and bedroom.
 
6.    
The Landlord produced
pictures of consistently painted walls throughout the entire unit prior to the
Tenant’s move in, as well as a white, non-descript light fixture in the
kitchen. The pictures from July 2021 showed a light pink and grey painting
throughout the unit, as well as two replacement light fixtures in the kitchen
and bedroom.
 
7.     The Landlord submitted they will have to
repaint the unit and restore the original type of light fixtures prior to a new
tenant moving in. I appreciate the
Landlord may not like the colour of the walls or the light fixtures installed,
however I do not find the quality of the paint job or the appearance of the paint job and/or light fixtures to be so inadequate so as to constitute “undue damage” within
the meaning of s. 89 of the Act.
 
Patio screen door
 
8.    
The Landlord seeks $75
for the replacement of the patio screen door and produced a picture showing a
small detachment of the screen from the very base of the door. This portion of the Landlord’s claim for
damages is denied, as the alleged damage appears to be very minor and I find
any damage to the screen door was the result of normal wear and tear.
 
Towel Rack
 
9.    
The Landlord seeks $25
for the replacement of the bathroom towel rack and produced a picture showing
the installed brackets without the towel rack.
It is unclear why the towel rack was removed. I do not find on a balance of probabilities that the removal of the towel
rack was caused by the wilful or negligent conduct of the Tenant.
 
Other
 
10.  The Landlord seeks $150 for wall damage
caused by two holes on the wall. The
Landlord produced a picture showing two holes approximately 12
inches apart. It appears the Tenant
may have affixed a picture at that location. The Landlord also produced
pictures of the bathroom door, showing relatively minor stains/scratches on the
upper right section of the door. This portion of the Landlord’s claim for
damages is denied, as I find this damage was the result of normal wear and
tear.
 
11.  At the hearing, the Landlord produced a
purchase order in the amount of $300.95 for closet doors for the unit. I find insufficient evidence was given as
to these alleged damages or their cause.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
