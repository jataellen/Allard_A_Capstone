File Number: SWL-57733-22
 
 



In the matter

OUELLETTE AVENUE WINDSOR ON

Between:


Skyline Living


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kimberly Wilson


Tenant



 
 
 
Skyline Living (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kimberly Wilson (the
'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes
because the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on March 4, 2021
with respect to application SWL-40882-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant
has not met the following condition specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $1238.06 rent
in full on or before February 1, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant was ordered to pay
the monthly rent in full and on time for the months of
March 2021 to February 1, 2022, in Order SWL-40882-20.
 
4.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed
to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from December 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,231.13
from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from October 1, 2014 to February 25, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SWL-40882-20 is cancelled.

2.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before March 8, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$1,102.19*. This amount
represents the , less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$40.70 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 26, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing*
on or before March 8, 2022,
the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 9, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 8, 2022, then starting
March 9, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 9, 2022.
