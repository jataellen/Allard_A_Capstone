In the matter

APT, 49 MEADOWLANDS BOULEVARD ANCASTER ON L9K1H8


 




Between:

Tenant




 


 
and


 




 


Hamid Kiani


Landlord



 
 
Review Order
 
Franco Stina (the 'Tenant') applied
for an order to determine whether the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
applies.
 
This application was resolved by order SOT-18946-21 issued on August
17, 2021. On August 24, 2021, Hamid Kiani (the 'Landlord') requested a review of the order. The request was heard by
videoconference on November 24, 2021.
The Tenant, the Tenant’s Agent
Sam Kiani and the Landlord
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord became
aware of the hearing after receiving disclosure from the Tenant’s
Representative but testified he did not receive the Notice or application from
the Board. The Tenant’s Representative did not provide
the Landlord with a copy of the Notice or the
application. The Landlord’s Agent
called the Board but a copy was not forwarded likely due to an administrative
error. I find on a balance of probabilities the Landlord did not have an
adequate opportunity to participate in the hearing held on August 4, 2021.
 
2.    
I do not find the order
contains a serious error. The findings of fact made in order SOT- 18946-21 issued on August 17, 2021 are
the same and the Landlord’s submission on the issue does not change the outcome of
the order. I find the Act applies.
 
3.    
Pursuant to section 5(i),
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, the Act does not apply if
“the living accommodations whose occupant or occupants are required to share a
bathroom or kitchen facility with the owner, the owner’s spouse, child or
parent or the




File Number: SOT-18946-21-RV
 
spouses’ child
or parent and where the owner, spouse,
child or parent
lives in the building
in which the living accommodation is located”.
 
4.    
In this case, the Landlord
and his child live in the upper level of the house and
the Tenant occupies the basement. The
Tenant enters his basement unit through the Landlord’s entrance, and he shares
the laundry room. These areas are common areas in the residential complex which
does not circumvent section 5(i) of the Act.
 
5.    
There’s no dispute the
Tenant has his own self- contained kitchen and bathroom separate from the
Landlord’s kitchen and bathroom. Since
the Tenant is not required to share the kitchen
or bathroom with any of the prescribed persons named in section 5(i) of
the Act, the Act applies.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The request
to review order SOT-18946-21 issued on August 17, 2021 is
denied. The order is confirmed
and remains unchanged.
