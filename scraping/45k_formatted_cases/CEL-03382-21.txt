Isaiah Crawley (Williams) Kaitlyn Fulton


 
Tenants



 
 
Susan Holmes (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kaitlyn Fulton and Isaiah Crawley
(Williams) (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video
conference on February 7, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal
Representative, Chris Holmes, attended the hearing. As of 3:36 p.m. the Tenants
were not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from October 1, 2021 to December
31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October 18, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on
December 2, 2021. The Tenants
were in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.
3.    
The lawful monthly rent was $2,100.00.
4.    
The Tenants have made no payments
since the application was filed.
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,100.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of
December 2, 2021, the date the Tenants
gave vacant possession of the
rental unit to the Landlord.




File Number: CEL-03382-21
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $1,699.54*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to December 2, 2021, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
25, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 26, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
