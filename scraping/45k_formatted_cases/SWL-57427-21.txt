Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57427-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


LOWER UNIT, 1096 MARION AVENUE WINDSOR ON N9A2J4


 




Between:


Nine Yoga
Holdings


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Rhett Maheu


Tenant



 
 
 
Nine Yoga Holdings (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Rhett Maheu (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the
order issued by the Board on August
19, 2021 with respect to application SWL-49717-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order: the Tenant agreed that there would be no further instances of any of the actions cited in the N5, N6 or N7 notices that had been served to the Tenant. On
November 30, 2021, the Landlord received notice that the Tenant has blocked the means of egress from the rear of the property, an action which had
been clearly identified in the previous N5 notice served. As a result of these
actions I find that the Tenant has breached the previous order issued by the
Board.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 25, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 25, 2022, then starting
January 26, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.

3.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 26, 2022.

The tenant has until January 24, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 24, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on July 26, 2022 if
the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
