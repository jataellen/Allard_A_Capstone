In the
matter of:


409, 22 TINDER
CRESCENT NORTH YORK ON M4A1L6


 




Between:


22 Tinder Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Crystal Powell


Tenant



 
 
 
22 Tinder Inc. (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Crystal
Powell (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard together
with the Tenant’s
applications, TNT-30188-21 and TNT-32956-21, by video conference
December 09, 2021
 
22 Tinder
Inc. was represented at the hearing
by its owners Steven Bloom and Michael Langer. The Tenant attended the
hearing along with her representative Yasmin Van Maurik.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The parties agree the total
rent arrears owing is $6349.98.
 
2.    
The Tenant submitted
the Notice of Termination (the ‘N4’) is invalid. Without a valid N4 the Board
would have no ability to order eviction. The Tenant representative submitted
that the N4 is incorrect because it lists the monthly rental the rental period
commences the 13th day of each month. This is contrary
to what was listed on the N4.
 
3.    
The Tenant’s
evidence does not support her position. The Tenant testified she is not home a lot of the time and pays rent on different
dates every month. There were times where she paid rent on the 1st day of the month. On everal occasions she paid in the
middle of the month, and sometimes she paid after




the 20th day of the month. This does not suggest rent was due on the
13th of the month.
Rather, it is indication the Tenant was persistently late with her rent
payments. I find lawful rent is due on, or before, the first day of each month.
Accordingly, the Notice of Termination does not erroneously state the arrears owing.
 
4.    
As a result of Order TNT-30188-21 the Landlord owes the Tenant $4,984.21
The money owing shall be applied to the rent arrears
owing. As a result, the rent arrears
owing to December 31, to the Landlord is $1365.77
 
5.     The Tenant shall pay the Landlord $186 for cost of filing
this application.
 
6.    
The total amount owing to the Landlord is $1551.88.
 
7.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant
relief from eviction subject to the conditions set out in this order pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant
shall pay the Landlord $1551.88
for arrears ($1365.77) up to August 15th, 2022 and application
costs ($186).
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall make the following payments

monies owing under paragraph 1 of this order:

3.    
The Tenant shall also
pay to the Landlord new rent on time and in full as it comes due and owing for the period January
1, 2022 to August 1, 2022, or until
the arrears are paid in full, whichever date is earliest.
 
4.    
If the Tenant fails to
make any one of the payments in accordance with this order, the outstanding balance
of any arrears of rent and costs to be paid by the Tenant to the Landlord pursuant to
paragraph 1 or 2 of this order shall become immediately due and owing and the
Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant apply to the Board pursuant
to section 78 of the Act
for an order terminating the
tenancy and evicting the Tenant and requiring that the Tenant pay any new
arrears, NSF fees and related charges that became owing after January 07, 2022.
