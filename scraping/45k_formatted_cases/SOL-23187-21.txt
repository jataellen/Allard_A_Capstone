In the
  matter of:


3028 SANDLEWOOD COURT BURLINGTON ON L7M3A5


 




Between:


Veena Malhotra


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Colleen M
  Denyer                    
Paul W Fitch


Tenants



 
 
 
Veena Malhotra
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Paul W
Fitch and Colleen M Denyer (the 'Tenants') because they have been persistently late in paying their rent.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 13, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord attended
the hearing. The Tenants were not present
or represented despite being served with the notice of
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have persistently failed
to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
2.     The Landlord served an N8 notice pursuant to
subsection 58(1)(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) on July 19, 2021 with a termination date
of September 30, 2021 because
the Tenants persistently failed to pay rent on the first day of the month when it became due.
 
3.     The Landlord testified that from January 1, 2021 to
October 1, 2021 the Tenants only paid the February
2021 rent on the first day of the month.
The Tenants paid every other month late and did not pay rent at
all for September 2021.
 
4.     The Landlord indicated
that the Tenants
vacated the rental
unit on October 1, 2021.
 
5.     The Landlord seeks an order for the $186.00 application filing fee.
 
6.     Based on the uncontested evidence of the Landlord, I
find that the Tenants failed to pay their rent on the first
of the month as it became due and have therefore been persistently
late in paying their rent.




File Number: SOL-23187-21
 
7.    
Since the Tenants vacated
the rental unit on October
1, 2021, I find that the tenancy terminated on October 1, 2021.
 
8.    
I
find that since the Landlord
has proved the allegations set forth in their application, they are entitled to the $186.00 application filing fee.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated as of October
1, 2021. This is the date
that the Tenants vacated the rental unit.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before January 31, 2022, they will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
