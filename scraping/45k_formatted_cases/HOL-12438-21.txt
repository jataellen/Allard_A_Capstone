Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12438-21
 
 
In the matter of:      3705, 25 SELBY STREET
TORONTO ON M4Y0E6
 




Between:                  TLR Property Management LP
As Agent On Behalf
Of 592 Sherbourne LLP


Landlord




 
and
 




Alba Fernandez Lizandra
Juan Caldas


Tenants




 
TLR Property Management LP As
Agent On Behalf Of 592 Sherbourne LLP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Juan Caldas and Alba
Fernandez Lizandra (the 'Tenants')
because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 1, 2022. As
of 3:16 p.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board. The Landlord’s Representative, Debra Fine,
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from October 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective October 21, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful monthly rent is $2,140.00.
 
4.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $2,140.00
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from June 18, 2020 to October 21, 2021.
 
6.    
The Tenants paid $8,560.00
after the application was filed.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant
voids the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental
unit on or before February 22, 2022.
 
2.    
As of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears
of rent and compensation the Landlord is entitled to by $1,274.73*.
 
3.     However, the Landlord
is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenants:
$70.36 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
February 12, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit,
and
$186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.     The Landlord or the Tenants
shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a
result of this order.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 22, 2022, then starting
February 23, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 23, 2022.
 
7.     If, on or before February 22, 2022, the Tenants pay
the amount of $2,326.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction
will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
8.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 23, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
