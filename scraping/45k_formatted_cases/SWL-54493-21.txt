Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-54493-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


201, 270 QUEEN
STREET WEST ST MARYS ON N4X
  1C8


 




Between:


Perth & Stratford Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Cory King


Tenant



 
 
 
Perth &
Stratford Housing Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict
Cory King (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay compensation
for damage the Tenant owes because
the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued
by the Board on August 19, 2021 with respect to application SWL-51725-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant
has not met the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenant denied entry to the Landlord, to carry out an inspection of the rental
unit, with the proper written notice.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for compensation for damage caused by the Tenant and the resulting order required the Tenant to pay an amount for damage. Accordingly, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for
compensation for damage.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $6,220.95 for compensation for damage and the costs related to the
Landlord's application fee in Order SWL-51725-21. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $6,220.95 and that amount
is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order SWL-51725-21 is cancelled.

and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move

19, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.

of this order, the Court

the Board will schedule a hearing.
