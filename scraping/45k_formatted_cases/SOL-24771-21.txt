and


 




 


Craig Rees


Tenant



 
 
W.O. Burwell
Inv. Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Craig Rees (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 14, 2021. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Warner Burwell,
attended the hearing. As of 3:21 p.m. the Tenant was not present or represented
at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the
Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the
Tenant was required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to December 31,
2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 21, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is
$1,400.00.
4.    
The Tenant
paid $7,000.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.     The only amount
outstanding is the Landlord's cost of filing
the application. As a result,
the order will be limited to costs only and not eviction.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
2.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the
full amount owing* on or before January 16, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
