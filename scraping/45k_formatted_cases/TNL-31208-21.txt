Hollyburn
Properties Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order requiring
Joyce Stinton (the 'Tenant')
to pay the rent that she owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 8, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s representatives, H. Waese and R. Mazur,
and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
2.      The Tenant remains
in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.      I disallowed the Landlord’s claim
for arrears from July 1, 2018
to August 31, 2018 in the amount of $433.08 because the
arrears were previously ordered by
the Board (Order TNL-06599-18, issued on August 28, 2018).
 
4.      The Tenant did not pay the total rent she was required to pay
for the period from September
1, 2018 to November 30, 2021.
 
5.      The Tenant paid $11,878.98 after the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$25,687.76, which represents the amount
of rent owing up to November 30, 2021.
 
2.      The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.




File Number: TNL-31208-21
 
3.      If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlord the full amount
owing on or before
February 11, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 12, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
