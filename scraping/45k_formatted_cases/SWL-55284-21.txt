Michael Pechinger (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that
the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on January 13, 2022.
Only the Landlord’s Agent
Timothy Mobberley, attended the hearing. As of 12:09 p.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from January 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 18, 2021.

The Tenant vacated the rental unit on
October 25, 2021. The Tenant was in possession
of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.

rent was $1,450.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of October
25, 2021, the date the Tenant returned
vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $14,221.87*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to October 25, 2021.

3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.

owing* on or before February
2, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 3, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
