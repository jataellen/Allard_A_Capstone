Homes First
Society (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Landell Joseph (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex has wilfully caused undue damage to the
premises and/or used the rental unit or the residential complex in a manner
that is inconsistent with use as a
residential premises and that has caused or can be expected to cause
significant damage; and because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit
or a person the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has seriously
impaired the safety of any person.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 16, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord’s agent Sheena Millette
and Maria Escobar
attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
The Landlord served the Tenant with a Form N7 on July
30, 2021, with a notice
of termination date of August 13, 2021.
 
2.    The Landlord brought this application, on the basis
the Tenant has wilfully caused undue damage to the rental unit or residential
complex and the Tenant has seriously
impaired the safety of another person within the residential complex.
 
3.    The Tenant has been living at the rental unit for
approximately 2 years. There are
approximately 50 other tenants living at the residential complex.
 
4.   
The Landlord’s
agent testified that on July 19, 2021 the Tenant pursued and cornered another
tenant on the 2nd floor and physically assaulted this
resident.
 
5.   
The Landlord tendered into
evidence various security camera photographs from the night in question, showing the Tenant
in possession of large belt and repeatedly striking the




 
other resident
in the upper face area. In the
photographs, the individual appeared to be cornered by the Tenant at the
elevator entrance and was using his arms in an attempt to shield his face
during the assault.  It is clear from
the parties’ body language that the Tenant was the sole aggressor and that the
other resident appeared to be in quite a vulnerable state.
 
6.    The Landlord’s agent also testified that on June 25,
2021, July 12 and July 16, the Tenant pulled the fire alarms in the residential
copmlex. Damage was caused to the second-floor west hallway fire pull station as a result of the Tenant’s
actions, necessitating a cage being installed.
 
7.   
I find on a balance of
probabilities that the Tenant has seriously impaired the safety of another resident in the residential complex as a
result of the assault that took place on July 19, 2021 and that the Tenant wilfully caused
damage to the fire pull station.
 
Other
 
8.    The Landlord also testified that on various occasions
between November 2020 through to July 2021, the Tenant “harassed” other
residents by banging on their doors and demanding
money and cigarettes. While I
appreciate these events may have caused fear for other residents in the
building, I do not find that these events seriously impaired the safety of any
person in the residential complex.
 
9.    The Landlord further testified that another resident
had broken his hand on July 16, 2021, following an altercation with the Tenant. This resident did not testify and very few
particulars were provided in support of this allegation. I make no finding in respect of this allegation.
 
Section 83
 
10. Section 83  requires
that  I  consider all the circumstances, including the Tenant’s
and the Landlord’s situations
to determine if it would be appropriate to grant section 83
relief from eviction.
 
11. The Tenant resides in a rent-geared-to-income unit. The Landlord advised that the Tenant’s
behaviour has deteriorated over the past 6 months and his threatening and erratic behaviour has caused a significant
amount of fear and apprehension among other residents and staff.
 
12. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenant did not attend the hearing, and thus
did not provide any evidence that may be relevant to my determination under s.
83.




 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
February 10, 2022. The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before February 10, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 10, 2022, then starting
February 11, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
3.    
Upon receipt of this order, the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 11, 2022. The Sheriff is requested to expedite the enforcement
of this order.
