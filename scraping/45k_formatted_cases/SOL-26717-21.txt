Susan Baxter (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sarah Jane
Wasilik and Brian Zawyidiwski (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants failed to

did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.

have not met the following condition specified in the order: the Tenants did not pay the lawful rent for December on or before December 5, 2021.

between the Landlord

on or before January 25, 2022, then starting January
