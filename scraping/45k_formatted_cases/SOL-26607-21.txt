Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26607-21
 
 
In the matter of:      23 ACADEMY STREET
ST CATHARINES ON L2R4Z7
 
Between:                  Ian Faiers                                    Landlord
 
 
and
 




May Wayne Peter Wall


Tenants




 
 
 
On November 18, 2021, Ian Faiers
(the 'Landlord') applied in this L4 application for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Peter Wall and May Wayne (the 'Tenants') and for an order to
have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants
failed to meet a condition specified
in the consent order issued
by the Board on October
19, 2021 with respect to L1 application SOL- 23468-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The previous consent order
provided that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants did not meet
certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I find that the Tenants have not
met the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenants did not pay $1500.00 (arrears)
on or before November 15, 2021 and did not pay $1,500.00 (rent) on or before
November 1, 2021. These were breaches
of paragraphs 1 and 2 respectively of the consent
order. This L4 application was filed
within 30 days of the breaches.
 
3.       
The previous L1 application included a request
for an order for the payment
of arrears of rent. The resulting consent order
required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent.
Accordingly, in addition to eviction, in this L4 application the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenants agreed and were
ordered to pay $4,686.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's L1 application fee in the prior consent
order SOL-23468-21. The amount that is still owing from that
order is $3,186.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous consent order
SOL-23468-21 is cancelled.




 
5.       
Since the date of the consent
order, the Tenants
have failed to pay the full rent that
became owing for the period from January 11, 2021 to January 31, 2022.
 
6.       
There was no last month’s rent deposit collected.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The previous consent order SOL-23468-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move
out of the rental
unit on or before
January 15, 2022 (standard 11 days from the
issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
If the Tenants made any payments
to the Landlord after the filing of this L4 application,
those amounts shall be deducted from the calculations below.
 
4.       
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $4,686.00*. This amount represents the rent owing up to November 30, 2021 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous L1 application.
 
5.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$49.32 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting December 1, 2021 to the date the Tenants actually move out of the
rental unit or get evicted.
 
6.       
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
15, 2022, the Tenants will
start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 16, 2022.

The tenant has until January 14, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under

files the motion
by January 14, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating

filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that
has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
