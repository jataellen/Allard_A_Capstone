Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-54774-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


205, 88 OAKVILLE AVENUE LONDON ON N5V2S7


 




Between:


Amiraco Properties Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Alex Earnest


Tenant



 
 
 
Amiraco Properties Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Alex Earnest (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 20, 2021. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Jessica Lapowski,
attended the hearing. As of 2:42 p.m., the Tenant was not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period
from July 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective September 8, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $818.84.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $745.00 from the
Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 1, 2014 to September 8, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $3,102.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until February 28, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.




File Number: SWL-54774-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.
 
2.    
As of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the Landlord is entitled to by $68.77*.
 
3.    
However, the Landlord
is authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the Landlord owes
the Tenant: $26.92 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January
8, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit, and $186.00 for the cost of
filing the application.
 
4.    
The Landlord
or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
7.     If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$1,565.88 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$2,384.72 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022**.
If the Tenant
does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph
and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after March
1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
