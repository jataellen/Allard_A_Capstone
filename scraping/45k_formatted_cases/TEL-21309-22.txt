Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 



 


File Number: TEL-21309-22




In the matter
of:


2 BRIDGE STREET PICTON ON K0K2T0


 




Between:


Margaret Watson


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Dominic Boone


Tenant



 
On January 5, 2022, Margaret
Watson (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dominic
Boone (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
entered into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord and the Tenant
signed an agreement to terminate the tenancy as of
February 28, 2022.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 28, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 28, 2022, then starting
March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 1, 2022.
