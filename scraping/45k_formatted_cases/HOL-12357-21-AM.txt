Amended Order Order under Section
77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
And section 21.1 of the Statutory Powers Procedure Act
 
File Number: HOL-12357-21-AM
 
 



In the matter
of:


1703, 898 PORTAGE PARKWAY VAUGHAN ON L4K 0J6


 




Between:


Chen Huang
  Jing Shi Jinxia Dong


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Shanika
Jones


Tenant



 
 
 
Chen Huang, Jing
Shi and Jinxia Dong (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Shanika Jones
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant entered
into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
This amended order is
issued to correct a clerical error in the original order issued January 4, 2022, wherein
the file number
was omitted from the first
page of the order. The order is otherwise unamended.
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlords
and the Tenant signed an agreement to terminate the tenancy as of
November 14, 2021.
 
2.    
Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlords and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 15, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.




File Number: HOL-12357-21-AM
 
3.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after January 16, 2022.

The tenant has until January 14, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 77(6) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 14, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on July 16, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction
where the rental unit is located.
