Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-03364-21



In the
matter of:


207, 31 FAIR
OAKS PLACE BRAMPTON ON
  L6Y4W9


 




Between:


Peel Housing Corporation Operating As Peel Living


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Leticia Darkoh


 
Tenant



 
 
Peel Housing Corporation
Operating As Peel Living (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Leticia
Darkoh (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video
conference on February 7, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Bhupinder Vaid, attended the hearing. As of 1:50 p.m.
the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
August 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
29, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
3.    
The lawful monthly rent is $1,484.00.
4.    
The Tenant paid $6,999.00
after the application was filed.
 
5.     The amount outstanding to January 31, 2022, inclusive of rent arrears
($2,976.00) and costs
($186.00) is $3,162.00.
 
6.     The Landlord states
that the Tenant
said she made a payment
on the hearing date but did not say how much she paid. This
payment has not been factored into the amount owing under this order and shall
be credited to the amount owing once received. The Landlord requested that the
Tenant be given a payment plan subject to section 78 Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), rather than an eviction order. I find it appropriate
to grant the Landlord's request.




 
7.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it
would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the conditions set
out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$3,162.00, which represents the arrears of rent
($2,976.00) and costs ($186.00) outstanding for the period ending February 28,
2022.
 
2.     The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant
is denied on the condition
that:
 
(a)  
The Tenant shall make the following payments to the Landlord in respect of the
monies owing under paragraph 1 of this order:

(b)  
The Tenant shall also pay the Landlord the rent for the months of
March 1, 2022 up to and
including October 2022 in full, on or before the first day of each
corresponding month.
 
3.    
If the Tenant fails to make any of the payments
in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates required, then:
 
(a)  
The Landlord may apply under
section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, and for the payment
of any new arrears of rent and NSF
charges not already ordered under paragraph 1 of




 
this order. The Landlord
must make the application within
30 days of a breach
of a condition set out in
paragraph 2 of this order.
 
(b)  
The balance owing under paragraph
1 of this order shall become payable on the day following the date of default. The monies owing
shall bear interest
at the post-judgment interest rate determined under subsection 207(7)
of the Act.
