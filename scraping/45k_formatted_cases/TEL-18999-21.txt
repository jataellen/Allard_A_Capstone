File Number: TEL-18999-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


901, 3950 LAWRENCE AVENUE
E TORONTO ON M1G1R8


 




Between:


Direct Properties Inc C/o Grant
Mgt


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Malalay Barakzay Turpikay Barakzay


Tenants



 
 
 
Direct Properties Inc C/o Grant Mgt (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Turpikay Barakzay and Malalay Barakzay (the 'Tenants') because they
have been persistently late in paying their rent. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard by video conference
on December 14, 2021.
 
At 12:17
pm, the Landlord’s Representative Jeff Shabes and the Landlord’s Property Manager Jana
Komisar attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s L2/N8 application is made pursuant
to an N8 notice of termination served on the Tenants on August 16, 2021 with a termination
date of October 31, 2021.
 
3.    
Based on the oral testimony of the Landlord’s representatives and the contents of the N8 notice, I find that the Tenants have
persistently failed to pay the rent of the date it was due. As per the N8 notice,
the Tenants have been late in paying rent 16 months in a row.
 
4.    
On the date of the hearing,
the Landlord’s representatives indicted they are not seeking termination as the Tenants
have been making an effort to
pay the rent. The Landlord
is seeking a pay on time order from the Board.
