Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-36361-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


401, 3400 WESTON ROAD NORTH YORK ON M9M2W2


 




Between:


Medallion Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Gabriella Ganouri


Tenant



 
 
 
Medallion
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Gabriella Ganouri (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes
because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by
the Board on October 4, 2021 with respect to application TNL-32886-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
According to information provided
by the Landlord there was to be a payment
made by the Tenant on October
1, 2021.
 
2.     This payment appears
to have been made.
 
3.     The next payment
was to be made on October 31,
2021.
 
4.    
The Landlord provided
information to the Board that clearly shows that while a key was not turned
over, the Landlord
knew that the unit was vacated on October 30, 2021 as two
of the landlord’s staff on site knew that the move was occurring on that day.
 
5.    
As such the Tenant was not in possession of the unit on October
31, 2021 which is when the next payment was due and
therefore the Landlord can not apply under a section 78 application.
 
6.    
The Landlord
may wish to file an L10 application in order to recoup the missing arrears.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application under section 78 of the Act is dismissed.
 
2.     Order TNL-32886-21, issued on October
4, 2021 remains in effect.
