Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-04237-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


BASEMENT APT, 19 BARRE DRIVE BARRIE ON L4N7N6


 




Between:


Linda Wazny


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Wright Alexandra
  Wright Sandra


Tenants



 
 
 
Linda Wazny (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Wright Sandra and Alexandra Wright (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord
requires possession of the
rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 27, 2022.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord served a Notice of Termination (the
‘N12’) on August 17, 2021. The N12 alleges the Landlord
required the unit for her own use. The N12 set a termination date for
October 31, 2021
 
2.    
Subsection 43(1) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') sets out the minimum requirements for a notice
of termination of a tenancy. Paragraph 43(1)(a) the Act provides
that a notice of termination shall identify the rental unit for which the
notice is given.
 
3.     The rental unit is in the basement of a house. The
Landlord lives upstairs. The N12 does not identify the address of the rental
unit correctly because
it only identifies the residential
house in which the rental unit is located; it does not specify that the notice
is for the basement. The N12 served on the Tenant does not identify the rental
unit for which the notice is given, in accordance with paragraph 43(1)(a) of
Act. Accordingly, I find the N12 to be invalid.
 
4.     The Landlord gave the Tenant a cheque for one month’s
compensation, in accordance with Section 48.1 of the Act, on October 28, 2021.
The Parties agree that the cheque remains uncashed. Given my findings
related to the N12,
I order the Tenant to return the cheque to the Landlord pursuant to s.
73.1 of the Act.
