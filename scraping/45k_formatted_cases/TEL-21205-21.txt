File Number: TEL-21205-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


102, 3111 EGLINTON AVENUE E
  SCARBOROUGH ON M1J2G4


 




Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Daniel
Shannon Sara Smith


Tenants



 
 
 
Siteline (3111
Eglinton) Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Daniel Shannon and Sara Smith (the 'Tenants') and for an order to
have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because
the Tenants failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on July 21, 2021 with respect
to application TEL-15427-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenants have not met the following
condition specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $1303.34 rent on
December 1, 2021.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order
required the Tenants
to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenants were
ordered to pay $4,597.38 for rent arrears and the costs related to the
Landlord's application fee in Order
TEL-15427-21. The amount
that is still owing
from that order is $2,095.40 and that
amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order TEL-15427-21
is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenants
have failed to pay the full rent that became owing.




 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,276.90 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from July 1, 2016 to
January 13, 2022.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TEL-15427-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 24, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $2,584.26*. (less any amounts paid since the application was
filed December 7, 2021.)This amount represents the rent owing up to January 13, 2022 and the costs
related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $42.85
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 14, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
24, 2022, the Tenants will start
to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from
January 25, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 24, 2022, then starting January
25, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 25, 2022.

The tenant has until January 23, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 23, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.
