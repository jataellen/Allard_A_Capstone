Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-35361-21
 



In the
  matter of:


281 HOLLYWOOD AVENUE NORTH YORK ON M2N3K8


 




Between:


Haiying Huang


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Seyedahmad Hosseinirad


Tenant



 
 
Haiying Huang (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Seyedahmad Hosseinirad (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 10, 2022. The Landlord’s Legal Representative, Cuiwen
(Wendy) Hu, and the Tenant’s
Legal Representative, Mark Breslow,
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from September 3, 2021 to March 2, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective October 19, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $6,850.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $6,850.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from August 4, 2021 to
October 19, 2021.
 
7.    
The Landlord’s claim for the
period ending March 2, 2022 exceeds the Board’s monetary jurisdiction of $35,000.00. The Landlord indicated
a desire to proceed with the hearing
of the application and voluntarily waived the portion of the claim that
exceeds the Board’s monetary jurisdiction.




 
8.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 1, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $31,302.64*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
18, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$225.21 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 19, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before March 1, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from March 2, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 1, 2022,
then starting March
2, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 2, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before March 1, 2022, the Tenant pays the
amount of $35,186.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this
order for eviction will be void. This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if the Tenant pays the amount required
under that subsection on or after March 2, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make
this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
