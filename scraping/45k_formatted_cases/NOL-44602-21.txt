Order under
Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number: NOL-44602-21




 
In the matter
  of:


 
2396 LEBEL STREET SUDBURY ON P3A2E5


 




Between:


Carlee Parisotto


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Noah Blouin


Tenant



 
 
 
On November
23, 2021 Carlee
Parisotto (the 'Landlord') applied in this L3 application for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Noah Blouin
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant entered
into an agreement to terminate
the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    The
Landlord and the Tenant signed
an N11 Agreement to End the Tenancy
with effective termination date December 31, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 15, 2022 (standard 11 days from the
issuance date of this order).
 
2.       
Since the Landlord applied
for this order
before the termination date (rather than after the termination date if the Tenant failed
to move out according to their agreement), the costs of the application
filing fee will not be imposed on the Tenant.
 
3.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
4.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 16, 2022.
 
 
January 4, 2022

The tenant has until January 14, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 77(6) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 14, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on July 16, 2022 if the order has not been
filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that
has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
