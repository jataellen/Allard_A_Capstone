Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Monique Bobb


Tenant



 
Quadreal Residential Properties Lp (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Monique Bobb (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay
the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on July 19, 2021 with respect to
application CEL-97686-20.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved by order CEL-03432-21, issued on November 10, 2021.
The Tenant filed a motion to set aside order CEL-03432-21.
 
This motion was heard by videoconference on January 6,
2022.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant attended
the hearing. The Landlord was represented by David
Ciobotaru.
 
Determinations:
 
PRELIMINARY ISSUE
 
1.    
At the beginning of the hearing, I
invited submissions from the parties with respect to whether they would have an
objection to me adjudicating this motion given my prior employment during the period June 2014 to April
2019, with the paralegal firm which is representing this Landlord.
 
2.    
I
informed the parties
that since my appointment to the Landlord
and Tenant Board I have had no involvement with my former
employer. As far as I could recall, I had no participation in any application
concerning this Tenant or this tenancy or any knowledge of any such application
while I was employed with the Landlord’s paralegal’s firm.
 
3.    
The Tenant confirmed that this was the first time she recalled seeing me and that we had
not met previously. She also indicated she had no objection to me adjudicating
this application. The Landlord also had no objection to me adjudicating this
application.
 
4.     I proceeded to hear the Tenant’s motion
to set aside the order.




 
MOTION TO SET ASIDE ORDER
 
5.    
At the hearing, the Tenant agreed
she breached the terms of order CEL-97686-20 as it is set out in the order CEL-03432-21. She
failed to pay the arrears of $560.16 in full on or before September 20, 2021.
 
6.    
This means that the issue is whether or not the Board is satisfied, having
regard to all the
circumstances, that it would not be unfair to set aside the eviction order.
(See: s. 78(11)(b) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').)
 
7.   
This tenancy began in October
2018. The monthly
rent is $1,492.28 and is due on the first of each month.
 
8.    The Tenant testified that she breached order
CEL-97686-20 because of unanticipated financial distress she experienced in
Fall 2021. First, it was her turn to support her two nephews financially – a
responsibility that was shared between her aunt, mother and herself since her
sister passed away in May
2016 but that changed when
her aunt left the country, leaving it to her mother and herself to cover their
expenses; her sister’s partner was not helping
them financially. Second,
while she anticipated returning to work from her maternity leave, she was unable to do
due to concerns of leaving her infant child in daycare with the pandemic.
 
9.    The Tenant prefers to maintain her tenancy as she
lives in the rental unit with her husband and 14-month old child. She states
that she is able to pay the arrears aggressively over the next 8 months and
proposes a repayment plan whereby she would pay her rent on time and an
additional $1,000.00 each month commencing March 20, 2022. For the month
of February 2022, she would be able to pay an additional $500.00 on the 20th.
10. On cross-examination, the Tenant confirmed that she had previously rejected
a proposal made by the
Landlord prior to the hearing and that since that hearing, the arrears have
increased $100.00. She confirmed that she had been prioritizing other bills to
catch up, over her rent. She also confirmed that her issues with rent arrears began
before her maternity leave.
 
11. The Landlord requests that the Tenant’s motion be
denied, and the stay be lifted no
later than January 31, 2022. The Landlord explains
that prior to proceeding
with the hearing in June
2021, the Tenant had breached a private agreement that was made between the
parties; the Board granted the
Tenant an opportunity to preserve her tenancy and issued a repayment plan which
the Tenant breached once again.
 
ANALYSIS
 
12. The parties appeared
before the Board in
June 2021 and a repayment plan was ordered by the Board. I find that the
Tenant breached the repayment plan due to circumstances beyond her control,
namely, the increased financial responsibility that was previously shared by
three people now changed to two people.




 
13. Moving forward, the Tenant’s financial circumstances
will improve as she will return to work; in the interim, the Tenant has been receiving
more government benefits
and has a side hobby of baking and selling cakes.
 
14. Given the above, while the arrears have increased
since the last order, I find that it would
not be unfair to grant the Tenant a final opportunity to preserve the tenancy and repay her debt to the Landlord. As such, the
Tenant’s motion to set aside order CEL-03432-21 is granted and replaced with
her proposed repayment plan.
 
15. This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The motion to set aside order CEL-03432-21, issued on November
10, 2021, set aside.
 
2.    
Order CEL-97686-20 is cancelled
and replaced with the following
order.
 
3.    
The arrears and costs owing to January 31, 2022 total
$7,030.02.
 
4.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$7,030.02 as follows:
 
a)    
$500.00 on or before
February 20, 2022;
 
b)    
$1,000.00 on or before

c)

April 20, 2022;

5.     The
Tenant shall also pay the lawful monthly rent as it comes due in full and no later than the first day of every month
beginning February 2022 to September 2022.
 
6.     If the Tenant fails to make any one
of the payments in accordance with this order, the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant and within 30 days of the breach,
apply to the Board pursuant
to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenant and requiring that the Tenant pay any new arrears, NSF fees and related
charges that became owing after January 31, 2022.
