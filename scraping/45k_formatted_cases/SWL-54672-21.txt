In the matter
of:


UPPER FRONT, 1107
LESPERANCE ROAD WINDSOR ON
  N8N1X1


 




Between:


2429820 Ontario Limited


Landlord




 


 
And


 




 


Jason
  Keegan


Tenant



 
 
 
 
2429820 Ontario
Limited (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Jason Keegan (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order
issued by the Board on August 19, 2021 with respect to application
SWL-50718-21-SA.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 3, 2021.
Only the Landlord’s agent, W. Anouti, attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order
SWL-50718-21-SA provided that the
Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the
Tenant did not meet certain conditions specified in the order.
 
2.    
The Landlord
filed an L4 application alleging
that the Tenant
breached order SWL-50718- 21-SA, issued on August 19,
2021. The matter was sent to a
hearing because it was unclear who signed the application on behalf of the
corporate Landlord.
 
3.    
The Landlord’s agent,
W. Anouti, said that he is the official agent of the corporate Landlord, and he affirmed
that it was he who signed the L4 application. He also said that
the Tenant still lives in the rental unit, and that he breached the order in
August, 2021.
 
4.    
The Landlord
requests an eviction
order.
 
5.    
I find that the Tenant
has not met the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenant failed to pay $3,200.00 on or before
August 18, 2021, nor did the Tenant
pay the rent in full on or
before August 23, 2021.




 
6.    
The Landlord was
entitled to file an ex parte application for eviction. I find that the Landlord has proved,
on a balance of probabilities, that order SWL-507812-21-SA, was almost immediately breached. The Landlord’s agent said that the Tenant has not paid anything
at all to the Landlord since the consent order was issued.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 78 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) and find that it would
be unfair to grant relief from eviction. The
Tenant has not paid anything at
all since arriving at the consent set aside order in August, 2021, and the
tenancy is no longer viable. It is
prejudicial to the Landlord for the tenancy to continue.
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Order SWL-50718-21-SA, issued on August
19, 2021, is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 17, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $19,231.55*. This amount
represents the rent owing up to January 6, 2022, and the costs related to the application fee for the previous
application.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$42.74 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 7, 2022, to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
January 6, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from January 7, 2022, at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January
18, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 18, 2022.
 
 
January
6, 2022 Date Issued
 
South West-RO
150 Dufferin
Avenue, Suite 400, 4th Floor London ON N6A5N6

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on July 18, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction
where the rental unit is located.
