Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: EAL-97799-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1, 8 DALES AVENUE BROCKVILLE ON K6V5H1


 




Between:


Patricia Macbeth


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Shirley Bresee


Tenant



 
Patricia Macbeth (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Shirley Bresee (the 'Tenant') because the
number of persons living in the unit on a continuing basis is more than
permitted by health, safety or housing standards.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653#
on January 12, 2022.
 
The Landlord, the Tenant
and the Tenant’s
Representative, Linda Tranter
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord stated the Tenant has five people (3 adults and 2 children)
occupying a
two- bedroom unit on a continuous basis. The Landlord
did not know the size of the rental
unit and did not provide a copy of any city by-law standards. According to the Landlord, city by-law
only permits a maximum of two people per bedroom.
 
2.    
The N5 Notice of Termination required
the Tenant to reduce the number of people in the
unit to 1 to preserve the tenancy and void the Notice. The number of people
that is required by law is different from what the Landlord stated
in the N5 Notice. The incorrect
information on the N5 Notices renders it void.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The application is
dismissed.
