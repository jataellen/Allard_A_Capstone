Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19816-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


3, 953 CLONSILLA AVENUE PETERBOROUGH ON K9J5Y2


 




Between:


Peterborough Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Douglas McRae
  Wendy Moore


Tenants



 
 
 
Peterborough Housing Corporation
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Wendy Moore and Douglas
McRae (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
19, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Janice Scott, attended the hearing. As of 10:33 a.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 29, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $883.00.
 
4.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $883.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit has been paid to the Tenants
for the period
from January 1, 2020 to
December 31, 2020.
 
6.    
The Tenants paid $3,326.00
after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the

parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenants, and find
that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 7, 2022.
 
2.     As of the date of this order,
the amount of the rent deposit exceeds
the arrears of rent and compensation the Landlord is
entitled to by $376.53*.
 
3.     However, the Landlord
is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenants: $29.03
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 28, 2022 to
the date the Tenants move out of the unit, and $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.     The Landlord or the Tenants
shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a
result of this order.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 7, 2022, then starting
February 8, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 8, 2022.
 
7.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$782.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$1,665.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 7, 2022**.
If the Tenants
do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 8, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
