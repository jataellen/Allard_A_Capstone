Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
In the matter of:      BASEMENT, 1715 FEATHERSTON COURT
MISSISSAUGA ON L5L3E2
 
Between:                  Chunhua Cao Li Wei



 
File Number: CEL-03236-21
 
 
Landlords




 
 
and
 




Ali Babiker Meriam Ibrahim
Mohamed Babiker


Tenants




 
 
Chunhua Cao and Li Wei (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Mohamed Babiker, Meriam Ibrahim and Ali Babiker (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 24, 2022. Only the Landlord, Chunhua Cao, attended
the hearing. As of 2:50 p.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the
period from February 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of
Termination effective October 20, 2021
 
2.    
The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,500.00.
 
4.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,500.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from December 30, 2020 to October 20, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenants paid $500.00 after
the application was filed.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.

It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 11, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $7,265.05*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 31, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlords
$49.32 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 1, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before February
11, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 12, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 11, 2022, then starting
February 12, 2022, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 12, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlords or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$8,886.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$10,386.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 11, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not make full
payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline,
then the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 12, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during
the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
