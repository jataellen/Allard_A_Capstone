Review Order
 
Butera Property Holdings Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order requiring Loretta Banner (the 'Tenant') to pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved
by order SOL-19273-21 issued on November
12, 2021.
 
On November 12, 2021, the
Landlord requested a review of the order alleging there was a serious error in
the order or in the proceedings because the Member erred in failing to consider
whether the Tenant owed rent to the end of January 2021 (rather than to December
31, 2020, as ordered) due to the operation of
section 88 (1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the Act).
 
On November 23, 2021, the Board issued interim
order SOL-19273-21 directing the matter to a
review hearing for determination of the issue.
 
The request was heard by way of
video conference on January 21, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s Legal Representative, Jennifer
Ricci attended the hearing. As of 1:18 pm, the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served notice of this
hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
Landlord’s Request to Review
 
1.       
The Landlord’s Representative
submitted that at the hearing held on October 26, 2021, she provided evidence
to the Member that the Tenant moved out of the rental unit with giving less
than 60 days notice as required by the Act. The Landlord’s Representative
referred to the materials she filed with the Board for the hearing which included the
L1/L9 update sheet, the Tenant’s N9 Notice to End the Tenancy (‘N9 notice’) and the Landlord’s email reply to the Tenant’s N9
notice advising the Tenant they did not accept the notice




 
as it did not comply with the
Act. Based on the evidence filed, the Landlord’s Representative requested the
Member to consider s.88(1) of the Act and order the Tenant to pay arrears
of rent until the January
31, 2021, which is the earliest termination date the Tenant could have provided.
 
2.       
The Landlord’s Representative
submitted that based on the order issued by the Member
on November 12, 2021, the Landlord does not know if the evidence in support of s.88 (1) of the Act was considered or not as
no finding was made on the issue.
 
Findings
 
3.       
In review of the order issued
November 12, 2021,
I note the Member did not comment on the Landlord’s Representative’s
request for arrears of rent to the end of January 2021 pursuant to s.88 (1) of
the Act. As such, I am unable to
determine if the Member considered this evidence in making her determination to
order arrears of rent only to the date the Tenant vacated the rental unit on
December 31, 2020.
 
4.       
I
am satisfied on a balance
of probabilities that the order contains a serious error because
the Member did not make a decision with respect to the Landlord’s
Representative’s submissions on s.88(1) of the Act and arrears being ordered
until the end of January 2021.
 
5.       
The Landlord’s request to review the order is granted.
 
New Hearing of Landlord’s L9 application
 
6.       
The Tenant was in possession of the rental
unit on the date the application was filed.
 
7.       
The Tenant did not pay the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period
from December 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021.
 
8.       
The Tenant vacated the rental unit
on December 31, 2020. The Tenant did
not give the Landlord 60 days notice as required by the Act. The Landlord’s Representative submitted
in evidence a copy of the N9 notice confirming the Tenant did not give the
Landlord 60 days notice as required under the Act. The Landlord’s
Representative also entered in evidence an email sent to the Tenant declining
to accept her 30-day notice to vacate the rental unit.
 
9.       
Because the Tenant did not give
the Landlord 60 days notice to vacate the rental unit, pursuant to s.88 (1) of
the Act, the Landlord is seeking arrears of rent to January 31, 2021. This is the earliest termination date the
Tenant could have provided in her N9 notice as she served this notice to the
Landlord on December 1, 2020. Section 88 (1) of the Act provides that if the
Landlord did not serve the Tenant with a Notice of Termination, and the parties
did not agree to an early termination date, then
the Tenant must provide the Landlord with 60 days notice
to vacate the rental unit. If the Tenant fails to provide 60 days notice, the Landlord may seek an order
for arrears covering the 60 period. Section
88 (1) of the Act reads as follows:




 
If a tenant abandons or vacates
a rental unit without giving notice of termination in accordance with this Act
and no agreement to terminate has been made or the landlord has not given notice to terminate the tenancy, a determination of the
amount of arrears of rent owing by the tenant shall be made in accordance with
the following rules:
 
1.    
If the tenant vacated the rental
unit after giving notice that was not in accordance with this Act, arrears of rent are owing for the period
that ends on the earliest termination date that could have been specified in the notice,
had the notice been given in accordance with section 47, 96 or 145, as
the case may be.
 
 
10.    The Landlord’s Representative submitted that the
Landlord tried to mitigate their loss of rental income for the Tenant having vacated the unit prior to giving
proper 60 days notice.
The Landlord advertised the unit for rent on various
websites and social
medial platforms. Despite the
attempts to re-rent the unit in a timely manner, a new tenant only took
possession in June 2021.
 
11.   
The Landlord’s Representative submits that the arrears
of rent owing to January
31, 2021 are $2,246.16.
 
12.   
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,079.00 from the Tenant and
this deposit is still being held by
the Landlord.
 
13.   
Interest on the rent deposit of $76.41 is owing to the Tenant
for the period from June 3, 2017 to December 31, 2020.
 
14.    The Landlord is also seeking
an order for the cost ($201.00) for filing the application.
 
Findings
 
15.   
I
am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the
Tenant vacated the rental unit without
giving the Landlord proper 60 days notice
as required by the Act. In
making this finding, I considered the Landlord’s
Representative’s uncontested submissions that the Tenant only gave 30 days
notice to vacate the rental unit and that the Landlord rejected the Tenant’s
notice to move out because it was not in compliance with the Act. I also considered the fact the Landlord
tried to mitigate their loss by re-renting the unit as soon as possible, however their attempts were unsuccessful. Given my findings, I am satisfied that
in this circumstance, s.88 (1) of the Act applies and the Landlord is entitled
to an order for arrears of rent to the earliest possible termination date that
the Tenant could have given, being
January 31, 2021. This means that this order for arrears of rent will be
for the rental period as claimed by the Landlord for December 1, 2020 to
January 31, 2021, less the last months rent deposit and any interest owing on
the last month’s rent deposit, plus the cost of filing the application.
