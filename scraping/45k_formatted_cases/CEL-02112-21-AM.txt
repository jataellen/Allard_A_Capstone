and
 




Cara Crandon

Tenants




 
 
Amended Order
 
This order is amended
to correct a clerical error wherein the Tenants were ordered to pay
back to the Landlords the one month’s rent compensation; however, the original
order failed to include a deadline for the Tenants to pay back the
compensation. This order is amended to correct the omission. The amendment is
bolded below. No other changes have been made.
 
Jason Bates and Diane Bates
(the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Cara
Crandon and Jamie Crandon (the 'Tenants')
because the Landlord has entered into an agreement of purchase and sale of
the rental unit and the purchaser requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 16, 2021.
 
The Landlord, Diane Bates (‘DB’), the Landlords’ Legal Representative, Miranda
Medve, and the Tenants attended the hearing. The
Tenants spoke with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Preliminary matters:
 
1.    
On consent, the application is amended to reflect the current monthly
rent is $1,209.25.
 
2.     The Tenants adjournment request to summons
the purchaser as a witness
is denied. The Tenants had ample notice of the
hearing and could have summonsed the purchaser but failed to do so. Adjourning
the hearing would result in further delay and undue prejudice to the Landlords.




 
L2 application:
 
3.    
David Ramage (the ‘Purchaser’) has an Agreement of Purchase and Sale (‘APS’)
with the Landlords for the
purchase of the residential complex.
A copy of the APS, dated June 23,
2021, was tendered as evidence (Tab 2, Landlords’ Evidence Brief).
4.    
The Landlords paid the Tenants one
month’s rent compensation in accordance with subsection 49.1 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) by waiving rent for the month of July 2021.
 
5.     The Landlords filed a copy of the Purchaser’s declaration (Tab 4, Landlords’ Evidence Brief).
 
6.     The remaining issue
to determine is whether the Purchaser in good faith
requires possession of the residential complex for the purpose of
residential occupation.
 
7.     For the following reasons, the Landlords led
insufficient evidence to establish that the Purchaser in good faith
requires possession of the residential complex for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
8.     The Tenants contest the Purchaser’s good faith intentions.
The Purchaser was not present at the hearing to give evidence about their
intention. I give little weight to the Purchaser’s declaration and to DB’s testimony
about the Purchaser’s intentions because
this evidence is hearsay.
 
9.     On the basis of the evidence presented at the hearing,
I am not satisfied that the Purchaser in good faith requires
possession of the residential complex
for purpose of residential occupation.
 
10.  Therefore, the Landlords’ application must be dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlords' application is dismissed.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay back $1,209.25 to the Landlords, representing the one month’s
rent compensation given to the Tenants.
 
3.     If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full amount owing on or before
February 13, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 14, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
