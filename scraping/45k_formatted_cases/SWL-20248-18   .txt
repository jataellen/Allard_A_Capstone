Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: SWL-20248-18
 











 
 
 

BHI (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict LD (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes (the ‘L1’ Application).
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant has seriously
impaired the safety of any person.  The Landlord also claimed compensation for
each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date (the ‘L2’
Application).
 
This application was heard in London on
September 10, 2018.  The Landlord’s Legal Representative, ES, attended the
hearing as did the Landlord's witness, MF and the witness’ support person.  The
Tenant also attended the hearing and spoke with Duty Counsel prior to the
hearing. 
 
Determinations:
 
The L1 Application:
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from March 1, 2018 to
September 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective May 18, 2018.
 
2.     
The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
 
3.     
The monthly rent is $453.00.
 
4.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $355.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by
the Landlord.
 
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 15, 2008 to May 18, 2018.
 
6.     
The Tenant paid $906.00
after the application was filed.
 
7.     
The parties agree that the
amount outstanding to September 30, 2018, inclusive of rent arrears ($445.00),
and costs ($175.00), is $635.00. 
 
8.     
The Tenant proposed a
repayment plan ($53.00 per month until reaching a zero balance) and argued that
he fell behind in payments because of the Landlord’s unwillingness to collect
payment as the Landlord was intent on evicting the Tenant.  The Tenant also
testified that he has lived in this unit for more than ten years, has not had a
history of arrears, and is in receipt of social assistance, such that a larger
monthly payment is simply not feasible for the Tenant.  The Landlord sought a
standard order with a delay of approximately 30 days in recognition of the
longstanding tenancy.  
 
9.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.  This is a very
longstanding tenancy in which the Tenant has a track record of making payment
on time.  The Tenant’s income is very limited.  I accepted the Tenant’s
proposed repayment plan accordingly.
The L2 Application:
10.   The Tenant is alleged to have seriously impaired
the safety of another person in the residential complex.  I find that the
Landlord did not meet the onus to show that the Tenant caused a serious
impairment to safety on a balance of probabilities.   I find that this
allegation is not supported by the facts as presented in this hearing.  
 
11.   The incident giving rise to the L2 Application
occurred in January 2018.  The Tenant states that this happened in early January
2018.  The Landlord's witness recalls this occurring in late January 2018.  The
distinction makes little difference.  The Tenant admits the incident occurred,
but disputes some of the details recounted by the Landlord's witness.  
 
12.   The Tenant and the Landlord's witness were
friends, or at least friendly, for approximately ten years.  The Tenant went
out of town around Christmas 2017.  After returning, the Tenant felt compelled
to share his romantic feelings toward the Landlord's witness.  
 
13.   The Landlord's witness states that the Tenant
was aggressive in pushing his face into her rental unit, but acknowledged that
he did not enter the unit entirely.  The Tenant disputes this, and states that
he did not enter the Landlord's witness’ unit at all.  Both the Tenant and the
Landlord's witness agree that the Landlord's witness’ door was open at the time
– the Tenant did not break and enter or force the lock.  The Landlord's witness
recalls this occurring at approximately midnight.  The Tenant recalls this
occurring at 8:00 or 9:00 p.m.
 
14.   According to the Landlord's witness, the police
were called after this event.  The Landlord's witness did not provide a police
report (although an incident number was read aloud) and the Landlord did not
summons any representative of the police force who could have confirmed their
attendance and the results of any investigation.  The Tenant testified that the
police did not make any contact with him regarding this incident.  
 
15.   The parties agree about the essential details of
the event in question.  The Tenant told the Landlord's witness, at the door of
her rental unit (where they had often interacted), that he had romantic
feelings for the Landlord's witness.  The Landlord's witness told the Tenant
that these feelings were not reciprocated and that his advances were
unwelcome.  The Tenant then left the area.
 
16.   After this, the Tenant made no direct contact
with the Landlord's witness until the date of this hearing.  The Tenant seems
to have received the Landlord's witness’ message clearly.  
 
17.   The Landlord's witness testified that the Tenant
phoned the police “on her” twice after the initial incident.  Once to complain
of noise and once for a wellness check.  The Tenant acknowledges having called
for a wellness check on one occasion as he was convinced that the Landlord's
witness was in distress or needed assistance.  The Tenant denies having made
any other contact with the police, and again no corroborating evidence was
provided by the Landlord or the Landlord's witness.  
 
18.   I appreciate that the Landlord's witness felt
uncomfortable when confronted with the Tenant’s amorous feelings.  This was
plainly an unsolicited and uninvited expression.  The Landlord's witness was
well within her rights to be annoyed, angry, upset, stressed and generally
uncomfortable.  If the Tenant were pushing his way into the rental unit, I
would have no hesitation in finding that the Landlord's witness was justified
in striking him, calling the police and taking whatever measures she felt were
warranted in defending herself.  However, it is unclear if the Tenant did more
than simply stand in a hallway, express his feelings, and accept rejection. 
The Landlord did not meet the onus in demonstrating that the event in question
occurred as the Landlord's witness recalled as this was disputed by the
Tenant.  There was no compelling reason to find one source of evidence more
persuasive than the other.  
 
19.   The only aspect of the incident which appears to
impact safety is the unproven assertion that the Tenant tried to force the door
open.  Other than this, the entire affair amounts to an unrequited expression
of affection.  This is not properly the basis for terminating a tenancy.  
 
20.   Perhaps if the Tenant continued in his unwanted
advances it would have amounted to substantial interference with the Landlord's
witness’ enjoyment of the rental unit. This did not happen and was not the
basis of the application filed in any event.  Certainly if the Tenant expressed
an intent to injure or assault the Landlord's witness I would have viewed
things differently.  This was simply not in evidence before me.  
 
21.   The only aspects of the Landlord’s allegations
which were proven on a balance of probabilities were those which were expressly
admitted by the Tenant.  The Landlord simply lacked the necessary evidence to
demonstrate anything else.  
 
22.   It follows that the Landlord’s L2 Application is
dismissed.  
On consent of the parties, it is ordered
that:
 
1.      The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $635.00, which represents the
arrears of rent ($445.00), and costs ($190.00) outstanding for the period
ending September 30, 2018.  
2.      The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant is denied on
the condition that:
(a)  The

AND
(b)  The

3.      If the Tenant fails to make any of the payments in accordance with
paragraph 2, and by the dates required, then:
(a)      The Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenant, and for the payment of any new arrears of rent and NSF
charges not already ordered under paragraph 1 of this order. The Landlord must
make the application within 30 days of a breach of a condition set out in
paragraph 2 of this order. 
(b)      The balance owing under paragraph 1 of this order shall become
payable on the day following the date of default. The monies owing shall bear
interest at the post-judgment interest rate determined under subsection 207(7)
of the Act.
