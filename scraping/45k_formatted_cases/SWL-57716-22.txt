Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57716-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


5, 455
PRINCESS AVE LONDON ON
  N6B2B4


 




Between:


Devon Bell
Trident Property Management


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Robert Joshua


Tenant



 
 
 
On February 7, 2022,
Devon Bell and Trident Property
Management (the 'Landlords') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict Robert Joshua (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant entered into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlords and the Tenant signed an agreement to
terminate the tenancy as of January 31, 2022 and the Tenant did not move out of the rental
unit by the termination date
set out in the agreement.
 
2.     The Landlords have also sought their costs in this
application, in addition to the return of monies allegedly paid to the Tenant
and arrears of rent. As it is the
Landlord’s evidence that the Tenant did not vacate the rental unit prior to the
termination date agreed to, it is proper to award the filing fees. No further monetary award can be given on
an L3 application, as the application is made under section 77 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, and the Board has no authority on such an
application to award further compensation or rent arrears.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before March 6, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlords the full amount owing on or before
March 6, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 7, 2022,
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.




File Number: SWL-57716-22
 
4.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 6, 2022, then starting March 7, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
5.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after March 7, 2022.
