In the matter
of:


128 MELVILLE AVENUE MAPLE ON L6A1Y9


 




Between:


Wajma Soroor


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Elizabeth Spina


Tenant



 
 
 
Wajma Soroor
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Elizabeth Spina (the 'Tenant') because
the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on January 6, 2022 at 3:44 PM.
 
The Landlord
and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
The Landlord was represented by Roz
Bianchi.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     For the reasons set out below, I find that
the Landlord in good faith requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation for a period of at least one year.
Therefore, the tenancy is terminated effective March 31, 2022.
 
2.    
On August
28, 2021, the Landlord
served the Tenants with an N12 notice
of termination seeking
termination of the tenancy for the purpose of residential occupation by the
Landlord. The termination date set out in the N12 notice is October 31, 2021.
 
3.    
The Landlord paid the
Tenant compensation equal to one month's rent by an e-transfer on October 3,
2021. I find that the tendering of
payment on the Tenant complies with the statutory requirement under s. 55.1 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”), and was complied with prior to the termination date in the N12 notice.
The Tenant did not
accept the $2,000.00 e-transfer. The
net effect therefore is that the Tenant returned
$2,000.00 to the Landlord, which the Landlord
shall apply to the
rent roll for future rent owing by the Tenant.




 
Good Faith
 
4.    
The N12 was served
pursuant to section 48 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”).
Section 48(1) requires that, in order to be successful in this application, the
Landlord must establish that at the time of the service of the N12 Notice,
she required, in good faith, the unit for residential use for a period of at
least one year.
 
5.    
In Feeney v. Noble,
1994 CanLII 10538 (ON SC), the Court held that the test of good faith is
genuine intention to occupy the premises and not the reasonableness of the
Landlord’s proposal. This principle
was upheld in Salter v. Beljinac 2001 CanLII 40231 (ON SCDC) where the Court held that the “good faith”
requirement simply means that the Landlord sincerely intends to occupy
the rental unit. The Landlord may also have additional motives for selecting a
particular rental unit, but this does not affect the good faith of the
Landlord’s notice.”
 
6.    
The Landlord submitted
an affidavit with her application that she in good faith requires possession of
the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation for a period of at
least one year. At the hearing the
Landlord noted that she currently lives in a temporary accommodation, with a
lease ending at the end of March. She
currently commutes an hour to work as a nurse, and the new rental unit is located
closer to her work. Part of the Landlord’s motivation for reclaiming
possession of the rental unit relates to health issues which she describes as
high-risk, and may need her family to attend to her.
 
7.    
The Tenant’s
questioning of the Landlord focused on events around the service of a first N12
on May 15, 2021. The first N12 was
before the Board as matter TNL-32771-21 and dismissed for late compensation. The Tenant noted
that, only a few weeks before in April
2021, the Landlord had expressed a desire that the Tenant stay on long-term. In the intervening time, the Tenant had
contacted municipal by-law inspection on May 10, 2021 about renovations being done to the rental
unit. The Tenant
suggests that the chronology
points to a retaliatory eviction.
 
8.    
The Landlord
noted that the sudden change
of plan was occasioned by a previous lease ending, and an attempt to move in
with her partner proving less optimal than planned. She testified that she had
no knowledge when the first N12 was served of the Tenant having contacted the
municipality.
 
9.    
Under subsection
83(3)(b), I am required to refuse to grant an eviction order if “the reason for the application being brought
is that the tenant has complained to a governmental authority of the landlord’s
violation of a law dealing with health, safety, housing or maintenance
standards.” The Tenant’s submissions
require that I address this section. In
MacNeil v. 97445 Ontario Ltd., [2005] O.J. No. 6362, Divisional Court
noted in considering the identical provision of the Tenant Protection Act that
the requirement is that the complaint
to a governmental authority must be “the”
reason for the Landlord seeking eviction, not “a”
reason, as previous legislation had required.
Even were retaliation to be proven, it must be established that the
retaliation is the sole or primary reason for the eviction. I do not believe that the Tenant has
proven anything beyond an inference of retaliation of this nature, but even if
she had, the Landlord’s reasons for seeking to reclaim the rental unit are
sufficiently compelling that I would find




 
that any complaint to municipal authorities by the Tenant
was not the sole
or primary reason for the Landlord’s
application.
 
10.  I therefore find that the Landlord in good faith requires possession of the rental unit for
the purpose of residential occupation for a period of at least one year.
 
Relief from eviction
 
11.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it would
not be unfair to postpone the eviction until March 31, 2022 pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
12. 
The circumstances
facing the Landlord and her
motivations for moving into the unit have been previously described. Having regard to health concerns
more fully described
at the hearing, I accept that
a lengthy delay will place some prejudice on the Landlord.
 
13.  The Tenant is a single mother with two
teenage children. The rental unit is
located near the home of her current partner.
She claims difficulty in finding a new rental unit. I note that the original N12 was served on
her in mid-May 2021, and she has therefore had nearly eight months to find alternate accommodation. She has asked for a delay
to June or July.
 
14.  Having regard to the circumstances of both
parties, particularly the length of effective notice that the Tenant
has had, coupled
with the Landlord
now having a deadline of when
she needs to be out of her current rental
unit, I consider a delay to the end of March 2022 to appropriately balance the
competing needs of the parties.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated, as of March 31, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the
rental unit on or before March 31, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,128.50, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from November 1, 2021
to January 17, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $65.75
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from January 18, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The foregoing amounts shall be abated by any amounts
already paid to rent for the rental periods from November 1, 2021
onward (including the returned compensation of
$2,000.00 described
above), the rent deposit, and any interest
thereon.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before January
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.




 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 31, 2022, then starting April 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after April 1, 2022.
 
 
January 17, 2022
