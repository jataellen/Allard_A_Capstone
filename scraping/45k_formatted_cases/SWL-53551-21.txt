ORDER ISSUED
UTILIZING SECTION 78
Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-53551-21
 
 



In the
matter of:


230, 1616 OUELLETTE AVENUE WINDSOR ON N8X1L2


 




Between:


Metcap Living Management Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Wanda Pare


Tenant



 
 
 
Metcap Living Management Inc (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Wanda Pare
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in
by video conference on February
3, 2022,
 
The Landlord’s Legal Representative, Lana Mai, and the Tenant,
Wanda Pare, attended
the hearing.
 
It is determined that:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid $2,907.00 of the total rent
the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from June 1, 2021 to August 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination.
 
2.    
The lawful monthly rent for the period of January 1, 2021 to August 31, 2021 was
$969.00.
 
3.     The Landlord is holding a last month’s rent deposit in
the amount of $969.00 and interest on the last month’s rent deposit has been
paid to December 31, 2020.
 
Parking Issue
 
4.    
The Tenant raised an issue with respect to the use of a parking space in the underground parking garage at the
residential complex.
 
5.    
The Tenant testified that on or about June 18, 2021,
she had spoken
to the Landlord’s superintendent advising that she did not require a
parking space as she no longer owned




 
 
a vehicle. She further advised that it was her
intention to get another vehicle or use the space for her boyfriend’s vehicle,
so she would continue to pay for the
parking space until September 2021.
 
6.     The Tenant testified that sometime in September 2021,
she knew that she would not be in
possession of another vehicle thus she did not require a parking space. She further testified that her boyfriend,
JS, returned the parking garage remote to the management office.
 
7.    
JS testified that he did return
the remote to the management office however he was unable to provide the name
of the person he gave it to. He
testified that he was advised that the Tenant would be provided with a form to
complete to cease the parking space monthly charge. JS further testified that he does not own a vehicle.
 
8.     The Tenant testified that she was never provided with
a form but also admitted that she never followed up with the management office.
 
9.     The Landlord’s witness, the superintendent, RS, testified that he had spoken, on or
about June 18, 2021, to the Tenant and confirmed he was told that the Tenant no
longer had a vehicle.
 
10.  RS further testified that he ceased his employment
with the Landlord in September 2021 and therefore could not provide any further
information.
 
11.  The Landlord’s witness,
the property manager, SM, testified that because
the proper form was not completed by
the Tenant, the monthly charge for the parking space was still the
responsibility of the Tenant. She
further testified that the parking space assigned to the Tenant was empty as of
the day of the hearing.
 
12.  I find, on a balance of probabilities, the Tenant did
advise the Landlord in June 2021 that she no longer required a parking space as
of September 2021 and therefore should not be charged for the use of the space
commencing September 1, 2021.
 
Payment plan for Rent Arrears
 
13.  The Tenant testified that on February 2, 2022 she
received an email from the Landlord proposing a payment plan for the rent
arrears. She further testified that
the proposed payment plan included for her to pay the lawful monthly rent plus
$522.10 per month to be applied
towards the arrears.
 
14.  The Tenant testified that she wants to remain in the
rental unit and submitted that she would be able to make the payments in
accordance with the proposed payment plan.
 
15.  The Landlord’s witness, SM, testified that she was
unaware that a proposed payment plan
was sent to the Tenant.




 
 
 
16. 
The Landlord is seeking
termination of the tenancy.
 
17.  The Landlord did not submit any evidence with respect
to their attempts to negotiate a payment plan with the Tenant in accordance
with subsection 83(6) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 which
states that ‘the Board shall consider whether the landlord has attempted to
negotiate an agreement with the tenant including terms of payment for the
tenant’s arrears’. Therefore, I must consider the Landlord’s failure to
attempt to negotiate in determining
whether to grant discretionary relief from eviction.
 
18.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction
subject to the conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a)
and 204(1) of the Act. The Tenant
received an email from the Landlord on February 2, 2022 which indicates the
Landlord’s willingness to accept a payment plan for the rent arrears.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.   
The Tenant will no longer have
access to the parking garage or the assigned parking space.
 
2.   
Should the Tenant’s circumstances
change, she can request a parking space from the Landlord and at their
discretion, they may assign a parking space to the Tenant for a monthly fee.
 
3.   
The lawful monthly rent for the period of September 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 is
$909.00.
 
4.   
The lawful monthly rent commencing January
1, 2022 is $919.90.
 
5.   
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$5,903.80, which represents the arrears of rent ($5,717.80) owing to February
28, 2022, and costs ($186.00) to the Landlord to file the application to the
Board.
 
6.   
The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant is denied
on the condition that:
 
(a)  
The Tenant shall make the following
payments to the Landlord in respect of the
monies owing under paragraph 1 of this order:

7.   
If the Tenants fail to make any of the payments
in accordance with paragraph 6, and
by the dates required, then:
 
(a)  
The Landlord may apply under
section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order
terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, and for the payment of any new
arrears of rent and NSF charges not already ordered under paragraph 1 of this
order. The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a breach of a
condition set out in paragraph 4 of this order.
 
(b)  
The balance owing under paragraph
5 of this order shall become payable on the day following the date of default.
