Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19256-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1, 316
1/2 FRONT STREET BELLEVILLE ON K8N2Z9


 




Between:


Vanni Rentals Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Justin Mills Lisa
Seaboyer


Tenants



 
 
 
Vanni Rentals Ltd. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Justin
Mills and Lisa Seaboyer (the 'Tenants') because they, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have wilfully or
negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the damage.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit
after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 11, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord’s agent,
J. Peters, and the Landlord’s legal representative, I. Macinnis,
attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants did not attend
the hearing, scheduled
for 9 a.m. I waited over 90 minutes, and then
I proceeded to hear the matter on an uncontested basis.
 
2.     The Landlord served the Tenants with an N5 notice of
termination alleging that the Tenants caused extensive damage to doors,
hardware and windows,
and the Landlord requested that the Tenants pay
$1,005.70 for the damage.
 
3.     The Landlord’s agent,
J. Peters (JP),
is the property manager of the residential complex. She said that the Tenants did not pay the Landlord
$1,005.70 for the damage to date, and they therefore did not void the N5 notice
of termination.
 
4.     JP said that she went to inspect
the rental unit after July 15, 2021, because she heard
that the police had attended the unit. She
said that there have been a number of




 
problems with the Tenants,
including non-payment of rent. She
also said that the Tenants are well known to the police
because of a lot of disturbances in the rental
unit.
 
5.     JP said that the Tenants have many frivolous
arguments, and then they demand the intervention and time of the Landlord’s employees. She said that she has received many nonsensical text messages from them.
 
6.     JP said that there were multiple reports
of the Tenants consistently going up on the roof, which is accessed via an emergency
exit door. She said that all tenants
are prohibited from going up to the roof.
 
7.     JP said that she observed extensive damage in the
rental unit during her inspection of July 15, 2021. She submitted
into evidence an estimate from J.P. Service,
dated July 21, 2021, which estimated replacing
damaged door, door knob, installation and replacement of a broken window at
$1,005.70 including HST.
 
8.     The Landlord requests
the eviction of the Tenants
and payment of the $1,005.70.
 
9.    
I
find, on the Landlord’s uncontested evidence, that the Tenants have caused at
least
$1,005.70 of damage to the rental
unit and/or the residential complex,
and therefore I find
that the Tenants, an occupant of the rental unit or a person permitted in the
residential complex by the Tenant have wilfully or negligently caused undue
damage to the rental unit or the residential complex.
 
10.  The Landlord’s employee
did an inspection of the rental unit on July 15, 2021,
because
the Tenants’ behaviour had led to attendance of the police on the residential complex.
JP said that the behaviour was not isolated, but it was repeated on an
ongoing basis with disturbances and flaunting of the Landlord’s rules and
regulations. She also said that the
Tenants’ behaviour has used up a lot time and energy of the Landlord’s
employees, and the Tenants have also failed to pay the rent.
 
11.  On the basis of the above, I find that the Landlord
has proved, on a balance of probabilities, despite serving
a notice of termination, that the Tenants
have continued to cause disturbances and interfere with
the lawful rights, interest and privilege of the Landlord and the Landlord’s
employees. Therefore, eviction
is the appropriate remedy.
 
12.  The Tenants, an occupant of the rental unit or a
person permitted in the residential complex
by the Tenants have wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the rental unit by damaging doors, hardware
and windows.
 
13.  The Landlord will incur costs
of $1,005.70 to repair the damage
and/or replace property that was damaged and cannot be reasonably repaired.
 
14.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
above in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would
be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.




 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated, as of
February 6, 2022. The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before February 6, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $1,005.70, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage and/or replacing the damaged
property.
 
3.     If the Tenants
do not vacate the rental
unit on or before February
6, 2022, the Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $42.74 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from February 7, 2022 to the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February 6, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 7, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 6, 2022, then starting
February 7, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 7, 2022.
