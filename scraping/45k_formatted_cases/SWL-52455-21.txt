Bryanna Eckenstein
  Steven Peacock


Tenants



 
 
 
Euro Properties Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Steven Peacock
and Bryanna Eckenstein (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the
rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 13, 2022. Only the Landlord’s agent, Tomas Soural, attended the hearing. As of 1:48 p.m., the
Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from March 1, 2021 to June 30,
2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective April 21, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on November
30, 2021. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,550.00.
 
4.    
The Tenants have made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,550.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from January 1, 2021 to
April 21, 2021.




File Number: SWL-52455-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of November
30, 2021, the date the Tenants gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $9,833.75*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to November
30, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or
before February 1, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 2,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
