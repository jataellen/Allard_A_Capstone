Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-56437-21



In the matter of:


524 ST JOSEPH
STREET WINDSOR ON N9C3H4


 




Between:


Windsor Essex Community Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Akintunde Akinbile


 
Tenant



 
 
Windsor Essex Community Housing
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Akintunde Akinbile (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did
not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 10, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Madeline
Roy, attended the hearing. As of 11:01 a.m.,
the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from January 1, 2020 to February 28, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective February 11, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
3.    
The lawful monthly rent as of January 1, 2022 is
$693.00.
4.    
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
5.    
The Tenant paid $2,935.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.     The amount outstanding to February 28, 2022, inclusive of rent arrears
($4,940.00) and costs
($186.00), is $5,126.00.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from
eviction subject to the conditions
set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.




 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$5,126.00, which represents the arrears of rent
($4,940.00) and costs ($186.00) outstanding for the period ending February 28,
2022.
 
2.     The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant is denied
on the condition that:
 
(a) 
The Tenant shall make the following
payments to the Landlord in respect of the
monies owing under paragraph 1 of this order:
