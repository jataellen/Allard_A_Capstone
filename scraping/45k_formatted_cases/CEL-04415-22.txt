Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-04415-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


68, 2655 GANANOQUE ROAD MISSISSAUGA ON L5N 3A6


 




Between:


Antonio Iafolla


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kelly
  Vanoosterhout


Tenant



 
 
 
Antonio
Iafolla (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Kelly Vanoosterhout (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant
pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on December 13, 2021 with respect to
application CEL-01412-21-SA.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $1,000.00 (arrears)
on or before December 22, 2021, and did not pay the full monthly rent on or before
January 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $18,872.95 for rent
arrears in Order CEL-01412-21-SA. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $17,872.95 and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous order CEL-01412-21 is
cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.
 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,400.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.




File Number: CEL-04415-22
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 1, 2020 to January 19, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order CEL-01412-21-SA is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 30, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$16,686.63*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to January 19, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $53.42 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 20, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
30, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 31, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 30, 2022, then starting January 31, 2022, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 31, 2022.
 
 
January 19, 2022

The tenant has until January 29, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 29, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.
 
In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on July 31, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction
where the rental unit is located.
