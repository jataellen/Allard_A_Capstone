Stewart Roberge
and Sheri Robinson
(the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Samantha Hall and Steven
Emmorey (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants
pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on September 1, 2021
with respect to application TEL-16469-21.
 
The Landlords'
application was resolved by order TEL-20913-21, issued on December 10, 2021.
The Tenants filed a motion to set aside order TEL-20913-21.
 
This motion
was heard by video conference on February 7, 2022. The Landlord, Sheri Robinson
and the Tenants attended the hearing.
The Tenants spoke with Duty Counsel prior to
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     Order TEL-16469-21 provided that the Landlords could
apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain conditions specified in the order.
 
2.     The Landlords filed the application under section 78
of the Act, alleging that the Tenants failed to pay $150.00 in arrears on November 1, 2021, contrary to the
order. This resulted in ex parte eviction order TEL-16088-21 terminating
the tenancy.

and on going rent for the months of December 2021 and January 2022.
