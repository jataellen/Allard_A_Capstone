File Number: EAL-99295-22
 
 



In the matter
of:

Between:


LS GP Inc C/o Urbandale Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Deborah Smiley
  Robert Moran


Tenants



 
 
 
LS GP Inc C/o Urbandale
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Deborah
Smiley and Robert
Moran (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because
the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the
Board on February 2, 2022 with respect to application EAL-96257-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to the
Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants
have not met the following
conditions specified in the order:
The Tenants did not pay $1651.14 rent in full on or before February 1,
2022. The Tenants did not pay $348.86 arrears on or before February 1, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before March 5, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 5, 2022, then starting
March 6, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 6, 2022.
