Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-86233-17
 











 
 
 

P.B.P.I.(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict I.E. and D. E.(the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe. L1 application
 
And
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenants because they have been persistently late in
paying their rent. L2 application
 
This combined application was heard in Toronto on
January 24, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
            L1 application
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent they were required to pay for the period from October 1, 2017 to
January 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective October 31, 2017.
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $863.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2017 to October 31,
2017.
4.     
The Tenants paid $2,400.00
after the application was filed.
5.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
L2 application
6.     
The Tenants have
persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
7.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. 
It is ordered that:
            
            L1 application
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before February
6, 2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $645.94*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to January 26, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $29.26 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
January 27, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 6, 2018, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
February 7, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 6, 2018, then starting February 7, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 7, 2018.
8.     
If the Tenants wish to void
this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust:
i)        $959.00 if the payment is made on or before January 31, 2018, or
ii)       $1,849.00 if the payment is made on or before February 6, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after February 7, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
L2 application
10.   If the Tenants void the part of this order relating to the L1
application as set out in paragraphs 8 above, the Tenants shall pay the monthly
rent on or before 1st day of each month, starting February 1, 2018
and continuing up to and including January 1, 2019.
11.   If the Tenants fail to make any of the payments
as set out in paragraphs 10 above, the Landlord may apply under section 78 of
the Act, within 30 days of the breach, without notice to the Tenants,
for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants.
