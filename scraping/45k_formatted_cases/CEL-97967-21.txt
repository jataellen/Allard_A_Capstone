Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: CEL-97967-21
 



In the matter
of:


FRONT, 95 ALBERT
STREET N ORILLIA ON L3V5K4


 




Between:


Gary Oosterhuis


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Bonnie Amonite
  Jason Amonite


Tenants



 
Gary Oosterhuis (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jason Amonite and Bonnie Amonite (the
'Tenants') because
a)      
they, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone
they permitted in the residential complex have wilfully or
negligently caused undue damage to the premises.; and because
b)      
they, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another tenant.
 
The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the damage and compensation for each
day the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
This application was heard via video/teleconference on December 2, 2021.
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative Allison
MacSporran attended the hearing.
As of 11:25 a.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the
hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord filed an application with the Board on January
12, 2021 to end the tenancy
and evict the Tenants from the rental unit because the Tenants substantially
interfered with the Landlord’s; lawful rights, privileges and interests by
breaching terms of the tenancy agreement between the Tenants and the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit when the application was filed.
 
3.    
The Landlord's Legal Representative testified that the Tenants as of the day of the
hearing have moved out and vacated the rental unit.
 
4.     The Landlord’s application to end the tenancy and evict the Tenants is therefore moot.




 
5.    
On November 2, 2021 the Landlord
filed a request to amend the application to include remedies
for the payment of unpaid utilities as ‘damages’ totalling $2,360.21.
 
6.     The Landlord's Legal Representative cited changes to legislation that came into effect on September 1, 2021 under section 88(2)
of the Residential Tenancies Act.
 
7.     I acknowledged that the legislation under section 88(2) of the Act changed
that allows Landlords to
apply for a monetary order against a former Tenant for unpaid utilities.
 
8.     Section 88.2 now
states
(1)    
A
landlord may apply to the Board for an order requiring a tenant or former
tenant to pay costs described
in subsection (4) if,
 
a)    while the
tenant or former tenant is or was in possession of the rental unit, the tenant
or former tenant failed to pay
utility costs that they were required to pay under the terms of the tenancy
agreement; and
b)    in the
case of a tenant or former tenant no longer in possession of the rental unit,
the tenant or former tenant ceased to
be in possession on or after the day section 20 of Schedule 4 to the Protecting
Tenants and Strengthening Community Housing Act, 2020 comes into force.
 
9.    
I
denied the Landlord’s request to amend the original
application for the following
reasons.
•        
The Landlord failed to file with
the Board a the new L10 application to Collect Money a Former Tenant Owes that sets out the process
for applying under section
88.
•        
The revised/amended application filed
by the Landlord labels the claim as damages – utilities are not considered
damages.
 
•        
Rule 15 of the Boards Rules
of Procedures relating
to Amending Applications states
15.1 
- A request
to amend an application before
the hearing must be:
 
a)   
In writing
b)   
served with the amended application to all other
parties; and
c)   
filed with LTB with the amended application and a completed
Certificate of Service
 
10.  The Landlord has not filed a certificate of service affirming
that a copy of the amended
application had been properly served to the Tenants.
 
11.  The order contains
all the reasons for the decisions within
the order. No other reasons will be issued.




 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application is dismissed without
prejudice.
