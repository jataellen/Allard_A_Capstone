Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-53867-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


21, 1091 FELIX AVE WINDSOR ON N9C3L6


 




Between:


Alex Abes


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


James
  Bedard


Tenant



 
 
 
Alex Abes (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict James Bedard
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes
(‘L1 Application’).
The Landlord
also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
the Tenant because the Tenant
has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent (‘L2 Application’).
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 1, 2021.
Only the Landlord’s legal
representative, John Kulikowski, attended the hearing. As of 3:40 p.m. the Tenant
was not present or represented although properly served with the notice of this
hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
L2 Application
 
1.    
The Tenant has been
persistently late in paying rent. He was late 5 out of 5 months during the period of February 2021 to June 2021. The Landlord subsequently served the Tenant
with a notice of termination because they persistently paid rent late. The
Tenant has been late with their rent payments every month since June 2021.
 
2.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction in the L2 Application subject to
the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a)
and 204(1) of the Act. At the hearing the Landlord did not object to an order
that the Tenant pays rent on time for 12 months if he voids the L1 component of
the Order.
 
L1 Application
 
3.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
February 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective July 17, 2021.




 
4.    
The Tenant
is in possession of the rental unit.
 
5.    
The lawful
monthly rent is
$800.00.
 
6.    
The Landlord
is not holding a rent deposit.
 
7.    
The Tenant
made not payments
since this application was filed.
 
8.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of
the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
including the impact of Covid-19
on the parties and whether the
Landlord attempted to negotiate a payment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
L1 Application
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 17, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$8,997.02*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 6, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$26.30 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 7, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
17, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 18, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January
18, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 18, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 17, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $9,801.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.




 
9.    
The Tenant may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
18, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
L2 Application
 
10.  If the Tenant
voids the L1 component of this order
in accordance with paragraph 8 above, then for 12-month period
beginning in February 2022 and continuing for each month until January 2023
inclusive, the Tenant shall pay the monthly rent to the Landlord on or before
the first day of each month.
 
11.  If the Tenant fails to make any of the
payments required under paragraphs 10 of this order in full and on time, the Landlord
may apply under s. 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 within 30 days of the
breach without notice to the Tenant for an order terminating the tenancy and
evicting the Tenant
