In the matter
of:


2 SIMMONS BOULEVARD BRAMPTON ON L6V3V5


 




Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 


Tenant




 


Richmond Owusu


 



 
 
Kamalakar Alias Vaibhav Kamat (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Richmond Owusu (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant entered
into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
That application was resolved
by order CEL-04373-21 issued
on January 12, 2022. The Tenant
filed a motion to set aside order CEL-04373-21.
 
This motion was heard by video conference on February 16, 2022. The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    On September 18, 2021, the Landlord and the Tenant
signed an Agreement to End the Tenancy (N11) as of November 30, 2021.
 
2.   
The Landlord filed an eviction
application alleging that the Tenant did not move out of the rental unit by the
termination date set out in the agreement. This resulted in ex parte order
CEL-04373-21 terminating the tenancy.
 
3.    In support of the motion to set aside order CEL-04373-21, the Tenant did not dispute
signing the agreement terminating the tenancy but requested more time to
find alternative accommodation. The Tenant, who requested an additional three
months, testified that he has been met with disappointments in his search for a
new unit.
 
4.    The Landlord opposed the Tenant’s motion and request
for additional time stating that the Tenant has not paid the rent for five
months, since the agreement was signed. The Tenant argued that he only owes the
rent for four months.
 
5.    This application was brought pursuant
to section 77 (1) (a) (b) of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 which
states that a landlord may, without
notice to the tenant, apply to the Board for an order terminating a tenancy and evicting the tenant if the landlord
and tenant have




File Number: CEL-04373-21-SA
 
entered into an agreement to
terminate the tenancy; or the tenant has given the landlord notice of termination of the tenancy.
 
6.    I have considered all the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 77(8) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant the Tenants’ motion. There is no dispute that the parties
signed an agreement terminating the tenancy on
November 30, 2021. In consideration of the circumstances, it would be unfair to give the Tenant the additional three
months he requested as it would be prejudicial to the Landlord who has not
received any rent payments for months.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The motion to set aside order CEL-04373-21, issued on January 12, 2022, is denied. The order is confirmed and remains unchanged.
 
2.    
The stay of order CEL-04373-21 is lifted on March 31,
2022.
