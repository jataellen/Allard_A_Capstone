Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-29264-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


2937 ISLINGTON AVENUE NORTH YORK ON M9L 2K3


 




Between:


Steve Sanguedolce


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Michelle
Genova


Tenant



 
 
 
Steve
Sanguedolce (the ‘Landlord’) applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Michelle Genova (the ‘Tenant’) because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes
(the ‘L1 Application’).
 
This application
was heard via video conference on July 19, 2021 and reconvened on January 12, 2022.
Only the Landlord attended the hearing on either date. As of 9:31 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the
present hearing although
properly served with notice of this
hearing by the Landlord and Tenant Board (the ‘Board’). Tenant Duty Counsel was available for consultation prior to the
hearing.
 
Determinations and Reasons:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from October 1, 2020 to October 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a N4 Notice of
termination effective November 16, 2020 (the ‘N4 Notice’).
 
2.    
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on
September 6, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the
date the application was filed.
 
3.    
The monthly
rent is $2,850.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $2,850.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord. Interest on the rent
deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 1, 2020 to August
6, 2021.
 
5.    
The Tenant
paid $22,879.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.    
As the Landlord
included unpaid utilities in the N4 Notice of termination, I find that the
notice is invalid as it does not accurately reflect
the rental arrears
owing the Landlord
as of the date that the notice was served. However, as the issue of termination was




File Number: TNL-29264-20
 
rendered moot when the Tenant vacated the rental unit
on September 6, 2021, the only part of the L1 Application that proceeded was the claim for rent arrears. As a result,
the order in relation to that application will be limited to rent
arrears and costs only, not eviction.
 
7.    
This order contains all of the reasons in this matter
and no further reasons will
issue.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of September 6, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$1,368.70, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to September 6, 2021
($4,265.19), less the rent deposit
($2,850.00) and the interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit ($46.49).
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before
January 23, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from January 24, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.

Toronto North-RO
47 Sheppard
Avenue East, Suite
700, 7th Floor Toronto ON M2N 5X5
