Interrent c/o
Clv Group (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Jeremy Slauenwhite and Kaitlyn Wood (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe. The Landlord
also claimed administration charges related to NSF cheques.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on December 8, 2021. Only the Landlord's Agent, Julie Lloyd attended the hearing. As of 10:20 p.m., the Tenans were not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the
period from July 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective August 18, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenants
vacated the rental
unit on September 14, 2021. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     
The lawful
monthly rent was $1456.89.
 
4.     
The Tenants
have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     
The Landlord
incurred charges of $20.00 for administration charges
related to cheques tendered
by or on behalf of the Tenants, which were returned NSF.
 
6.     
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,439.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from March 29, 2021 to
August 18, 2021.
