Nenette (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 6,

Only the Landlord’s Legal
Representative, Joanna Aloy, attended the hearing. As of 10:39 a.m., the Tenant
was not present or represented at the hearing,
although properly served

was required to pay for the period from

of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective March 24,
2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on August
31, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is
$1,338.00.
 
4.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,338.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 15, 2020 to March 24, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $3,500.00 after the application was filed.
