Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Rikki Featherston


Tenant



 
 
 
Kirandeep Bhullar, Surjit Kaur,
Piara Singh and Jaspal Bhullar (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Rikki
Featherston (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did
not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard by videoconference on January 20, 2022. Only the
Landlord, Jaspal Bhullar, attended the hearing. As of 9:46 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from August 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of
Termination effective October 7, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on January
15, 2022. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $2,300.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $2,300.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 1, 2019 to October 7, 2021.




File Number: HOL-12317-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of January
15, 2022, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlords.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $10,337.04*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 15, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlords the full amount
owing* on or before February
8, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 9, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
