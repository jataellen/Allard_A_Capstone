In the matter
of:

Between:


Cuong (Poa) Vu


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Charan
Kaur Grover Jimmy Grover Rimpi Grover


Tenants



 
 
 
Cuong (Poa) Vu
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jimmy
Grover, Rimpi Grover and Charan
Kaur Grover (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Maria Sturino, attended the hearing. As
of 10:50 a.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent
the Tenants were required to pay for the period from April 15, 2021 to January 14, 2022. Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 24, 2021.
 
2.    
The application is amended to include a $1,000.00 payment
which had been
omitted.
 
3.    
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
 
4.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $2,600.00.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $2,600.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenants for the period from February 11, 2017
to August 24, 2021.
 
7.    
The Tenants
paid $10,400.00 after the application was filed.




File Number: CEL-02744-21
 
8.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of
the rental unit on or before
January 16, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$8,554.34*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 5, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $85.48
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 6, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
16, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 17,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January
17, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 17, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$12,186.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 14, 2022, or
ii)             
$14,786.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 16, 2022**.
If the Tenants
do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after January
17, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are




File Number: CEL-02744-21
 
only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.

In accordance with section 81 of
