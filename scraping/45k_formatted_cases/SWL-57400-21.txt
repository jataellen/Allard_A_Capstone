Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57400-21
 
 
In the matter of:      LOWER, 21 KERR STREET S
CAMBRIDGE ON N1R4A2
 
Between:                  Don Power                                    Landlord
 
 
and
 




Michelle Nelson Rick Bursey


Tenants




 
 
 
Don Power (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Michelle Nelson and
Rick Bursey (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent
they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued
by the Board on December 2,
2021 with respect to application SWL-53931-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenants have not met the following
condition specified in the order:
The Tenant did not pay $200.00 arrears on or before December 1, 2021.
 
3.       
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenants were ordered to pay
$1,307.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application
fee in Order SWL-53931-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $1,307.00
and that amount
is included in this
order. As a result, the previous
order SWL-53931-21 is cancelled.
 
5.       
Since the date of the order,
the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became owing.




 
6.       
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $700.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenants for the period from July 1, 2013 to January 11, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
Order SWL-53931-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 22, 2022.
 
3.       
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $1,497.91*. (Less any amounts that have been paid since the date of
filing the application.)This amount represents the rent owing up to January 11, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$23.51 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting January 12, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.       
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
22, 2022, the Tenants will
start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 23, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 22, 2022, then starting January
23, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 23, 2022.
 
8.       
The tenant has until January
21, 2022 to file a motion with the
Board to set aside the order under s. 78(9)
of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January
21, 2022 the order will be
stayed, and the Board will schedule a hearing.
 
9.       
In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on July 23,
2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
