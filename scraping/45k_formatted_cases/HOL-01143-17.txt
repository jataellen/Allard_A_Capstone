Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-01143-17
 










 
 
 

A.A.K.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict E.F.
and L.F. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on March 8, 2017.
 
The Landlord’s agent, M.A., the first-named Tenant, and the
Tenants’ son, D.F., attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from October 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective January 15, 2017.
2.     
The arrears of rent owing for the
period ending March 31, 2017, total $12,025.00.
3.     
The Landlord incurred costs as a
result of filing the application in the amount of $170.00 and is entitled to
reimbursement for those costs. 
4.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,975.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from September 1,
2016 to January 15, 2017, in the amount of $11.12.
6.      At
the hearing, it soon became clear that the Tenant and her son were not able to
properly explain what concerns they had with the rental unit, or explain the
reasons for substantial outstanding arrears. As the matter had come before the
Board early in the afternoon, the Tenant and her son were directed to seek
assistance from Duty Counsel and were encouraged to return for their hearing
once they had spoken to Duty Counsel. 
7.      The
Tenant and her son signed up for Duty Counsel, but then left the building
shortly afterwards. When the Board called the matter forward later in the
afternoon, the Tenant and her son had already left. As the Tenants did not
appear to present any testimony or evidence, I am satisfied that it would not
be unfair to grant the Landlord’s request for a standard eviction order. 
8.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It
is ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before March 21, 2017.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $7,445.10*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to March 10, 2017, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $64.93 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting March 11, 2017 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March
21, 2017, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from March 22, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before March 21, 2017, then starting March 22,
2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 22, 2017.
8.      If,
on or before March 21, 2017, the Tenants pay the amount of $12,025.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after March 22, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
