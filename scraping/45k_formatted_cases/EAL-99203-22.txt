Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: EAL-99203-22
 
In the matter of:      10, 16 RUSSELL
STREET
KINGSTON ON K7K2E4
 
Between:                  Sisopha Say                                    Landlord
 
and
 
Kevin Roberts                                                                                                                 Tenant
 
On January 10, 2022, Sisopha Say
(the 'Landlord') applied in this L4 application for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kevin Roberts (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have
the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant
owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the consent
order issued by the Board on November 23, 2021 with respect to L1 application
EAL- 96942-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The previous consent order
provided that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet
certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following conditions specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed to pay to the Landlord $500.00
on or before January 1, 2022 towards arrears. This was a breach of paragraph 2(a) of the consent order.
This L4 application was filed
within 30 days of the breach.
 
3.       
The previous L1 application included a request
for an order for the payment
of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the
Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition
to eviction, in this L4 application the Landlord is entitled to request an
order for the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.       
In paragraph 1 of the consent order the Tenant agreed and was ordered to pay $2,906.00 for rent arrears and the costs
related to the Landlord's L1 application fee.
The amount that is still owing
from that order is $2,406.00
and that amount
is included in this order. As
a result, the previous consent order EAL-96942-21 is cancelled.
 
5.       
Since the date of the order,
the Tenant has also failed
to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from January
1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.
 
6.       
On March 1, 2020 the Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $900.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.




 
7.       
Interest on the rent deposit is
owing to the Tenant for the date of collection, March 1, 2020 to the issuance
date of this order, January
21, 2022 (note:
there was no guideline
rent increases allowed and consequently no interest on rent deposit in 2021 due
to COVID19).
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The previous consent order EAL-96942-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 1, 2022 (standard 11 days from the issuance date of this
order).
 
3.       
If the Tenant made any payments
to the Landlord after the L4 application was filed, those amounts shall be deducted from the
calculations below.
 
4.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,388.78*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 31, 2022 and the costs
related to the application fee for the previous L1 application, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
5.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$29.59 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 1, 2022 to
the date the Tenant actually moves out of the rental unit or gets evicted.
 
6.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
1, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 2, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 1, 2022, then starting February
2, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after February 2, 2022.
