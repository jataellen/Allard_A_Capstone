Between:


Williams &

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Liette Bergeron


Tenant



 
 
Williams & McDaniel Property Management (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Liette Bergeron
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed
administration charges related to NSF cheques.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 13, 2022. Only
the Landlord's Legal Representative, Judith Davis, attended the hearing. As of 2:08 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
28, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
December 31, 2021. The Tenant
was in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,125.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord incurred charges
of $20.00 for administration charges
related to cheques tendered by or on behalf of the
Tenant, which were returned NSF.
 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,125.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of December
31, 2021, when the Tenant returned vacant possession of the rental unit to
the Landlord.




File Number: NOL-44172-21
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $3,395.00*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to December 31, 2021 and the total charges related to a NSF cheque tendered
to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
4, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 5, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
