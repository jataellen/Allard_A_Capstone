Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-98225-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


34, 653 ST LAURENT BOULEVARD OTTAWA ON K1K3A6


 




Between:


Jss Riverdale Holdings Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Alejandra Lema Gerardo Arreola


Tenants



 
 
 
JSS Riverdale Holdings Inc (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Alejandra
Lema and Gerardo
Arreola (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 18, 2022. The President Victor Saikaley and Alejandra Lema
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid the
total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from June 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective October 1, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     
The lawful monthly rent is $1,560.00.
 
4.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,500.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from May 1, 2018 to
October 1, 2021.
 
6.     
The Tenants have not make any payments since the application was filed. However, at the hearing, the parties
consented to satisfy a previous Order of the Board (EAT- 94453-21) whereby the
Landlord was ordered to pay the Tenants $1,512.75.
 
7.     
As a result, the arrears owing shall be reduced by $1,512.75 in order to set off the
debt owed to the Tenants under Order EAT-94453-21.




File Number: EAL-98225-21
 
8.     
The Tenants requested that I
consider an order whereby they would pay the lawful monthly rent plus an
additional $200.00 per month on an ongoing basis until the arrears were
satisfied. The Landlord opposed the
request based on the amount of outstanding arrears and based on the Tenants
failure to pay any rent at all for several months.
 
9.     
The Tenants have returned to work
as of January 19th and are currently waiting on unemployment insurance for the period they were without work. The Tenants
were unsure about how much
they would receive as a benefit for unemployment and did
not provide any evidence regarding the sustainability of paying their rent on
an ongoing basis.
 
10.  
Under the circumstance, I do not find it reasonable to order a payment plan that
exceeds 4 years.
 
11.   I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19
on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenant and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until March 15, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 15, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $9,214.30*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 9, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$51.29 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 10, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before March 15, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from March 16, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 15, 2022, then starting
March 16, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 16, 2022.




File Number: EAL-98225-21
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)          
$11,992.25 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022, or
ii)         
$13,552.25 if the payment
is made on or before
March 15, 2022**.
If the
Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after March 16, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
