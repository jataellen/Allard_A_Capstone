Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-07737-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


70 CHRISTIAN RITTER DRIVE
  MARKHAM ON L6C0V9


 




Between:


Hardutt Singh


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Auneya Munir
  Qasim Ali


Tenants



 
 
 
Hardutt Singh (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Auneya Munir and Qasim Ali (the 'Tenants') because they have been persistently late in paying
their rent; and because
the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted
in the residential complex
has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the
unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 20, 2021.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord's Legal Representative, Masoud Tchavoshi,
and the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Preliminary Issues
 
1.     Part of the application is based on two Notices of
Termination that the Landlord served upon the Tenants.
The Landlord served the first N5 on May 11, 2020 (the “1st N5”); it had a termination date of June 1, 2020.
The original certificate of service submitted by the Landlord indicated the
notice was mailed to the Tenants on May 11, 2020 which means the notice is
deemed served May 16, 2020, making the termination invalid as it is not 20 days
from the date of service.
 
2.     The Landlord testified that the notice was both mailed
and given by hand on May 11, 2020; The Landlord
pointed to a second
certificate of service
submitted that indicated the notice was also served by hand to the
Tenant on May 11, 2020; a text and picture dated the same day accompanied this service document. The Tenant could
not recall when the
1st N5
was received. On a balance of probabilities, I find the 1st N5 was received by the
Tenant on May 11, 2020 and is therefore valid




 
3.    
In regard to the 2nd N5, the Landlord served it
to the Tenants on June 4, 2020
(the “2nd N5”);
it had a termination date of June 24, 2020.
 
4.     Both the 1st and 2nd N5s claim that the Tenants, an occupant
or a
guest of the rental unit substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment or a lawful right, interest or privilege of the Landlord or another tenant. The
behaviour complained of is the same on
both notices: on November 25, 2019 the City of Markham transferred $1,806.40 to
the Landlord’s property taxes due to unpaid water charges; and December 9, 2019
the Tenants entered into an agreement to repay the Landlords the water charges
but breached it by only paying $400.00 towards the bill.
 
5.     Section 64 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’)
states:
 
(1)   A
landlord may give a tenant
notice of termination of the tenancy
if the conduct of the tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a
person permitted in the residential complex by the tenant is such that it
substantially interferes with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential
complex for all usual purposes by the landlord or another tenant or
substantially interferes with another lawful right, privilege or interest of
the landlord or another tenant.
 
(3) The notice of termination under
subsection (1) is void if the tenant,
within seven days after
receiving the notice, stops the conduct or activity or corrects the omission.
 
6.       
Section 68 of the Act states that if an N5 becomes
void pursuant to section 64(3), the
landlord may serve a 2nd N5 if, within six months after the 1st N5 was given, conduct occurs or a situation arises that
constitutes a substantial interference in section
64.
 
7.    
This means, if a
landlord serves a valid 1st N5 and if the tenant does not void the
behaviour, as is the case here, the landlord may file an application based on the 1st notice within 30 days form the termination date in that
notice. A landlord may base an application
on a 2nd N5 notice if that notice was served
because the tenant engaged in new conduct more than 7 days but less 6-months
from the date the 1st N5 was served.
 
8.    
As the behaviour complained of in the 2nd N5 is not new conduct the notice
is fatally flawed, and this part of
the application must be dismissed.
 
9.     With respect to the N8 notice of termination being
mailed to the Tenants on April 27, 2020, the Tenants agree that it was received
on April 29, 2020. As such, this notice is deemed valid pursuant to section 191(2) of the Act and will proceed
to a merits hearing.
 
Merits – N8 notice
of termination




 
10.  Based on the particulars contained in the N8 Notice of Eviction served
to the Tenant on April 29,
2020, I find that from November 2019 to April 7, 2020, the Tenants were late
paying their rent every month of the 17-month period.
 
11.  The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,800.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
12.  Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from April
28, 2016 to June 24, 2020.
 
13.  The Landlord's Legal Representative
advised that paid their rent on the 1st of the month since June 2021. The Landlord is
still seeking termination of the tenancy because he believes the only reason
the Tenants started paying on time was because he filed for eviction, therefore
there is a loss of trust.
 
14.  The Tenants did not dispute paying late prior to
receiving the N8 notice but have been paying
on time since.
They have their
finances in order
and requested a conditional order to pay on the first of the month.
 
15.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction
subject to the condition(s) set out
in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. There is
no prejudice to the Landlord if the Tenants are placed on a conditional order
with a breach clause. At hearing the pay on time requirement was to begin January
1, 2022 for a one-year
period; due to the issuance date of this order, the
pay-on-time period has been adjusted accordingly.
 
16.  This order contains
all the reasons for the decision within
it. No further reasons shall be
issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall pay the lawful rent to
the Landlord in full and on time, for
the period March 1, 2022
through February 1, 2023.
 
2.     If the Tenants fail to make any payments in accordance
with paragraph 1, the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order, without notice to the
Tenants, terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants, The Landlord
must make the application within 30 days of a breach of a condition
set out in paragraph 1 of this
order.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before March 1, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated
from March 2, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
