In the
  matter of:


812, 544 BIRCHMOUNT ROAD TORONTO ON M1K1P3


 




Between:


Canadian Mental Health
Association Toronto Branch &
Medallion Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Abdinasir Ali-said


Tenant



 
 
 
Canadian Mental Health
Association Toronto Branch (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Abdinasir Ali-said (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant,
another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the
residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the
premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to
compensate the Landlord for the damage; and because the Tenant, another occupant
of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex
has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after
the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
936 8115 8630# on October
19, 2021. The Landlord’s
representatives, Eliza Lowes and Samuel Korman, attended the hearing. The Tenant did not attend.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord’s Property Manager, Ben Antwi, testified
that he and the superintendent went to the Tenant’s unit due to a report
of water leaking
into the unit below the Tenant’s
unit. It was discovered that had put
paper towels in the toilet and had cracked the sink. Both of which was causing
water to spill onto the floor causing a flood in the rental unit.
 
2.     The Tenant had been warned about the problem with
paper towels being flushed down the toilet previously and the Landlord
had provided the Tenant with toilet paper on three different occasions to assist with
this issue. The Landlord also
discovered what was described as little rocks in the toilet which also
contributed to the flood.
 
3.     The parquet flooring
in the unit was damaged
to the extent it requires
replacing. There have been
repairs to the unit below due the water damage.




 
 
 
4.     I find tenant
has wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the rental
unit and the residential complex.
 
5.     The Landlord has incurred and will incur costs which will exceed
the requested amount of
compensation for damage of $2,871.86 to repair the damage and replace property
that was damaged and cannot be reasonably repaired.
 
6.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of February
13, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 13, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$2,871.86, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage and
replacing the damaged property.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $3,513.10, which represents compensation for the use of the
unit from July 3, 2021 to February 2, 2022.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$16.34 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from February 3, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
February 13, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 14, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
7.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 13, 2022, then starting February
14, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 14, 2022.
