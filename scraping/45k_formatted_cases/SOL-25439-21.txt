Order under Section

Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-25439-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


20, 10 ST. ANDREWS
DR HAMILTON ON L8K5J6


 




Between:


Cityhousing Hamilton Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Michaela Kinova
Pamella Gaborova
  Romeo Gabor


Tenants



 
 
 
Cityhousing Hamilton
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Romeo Gabor, Pamella Gaborova and Michaela Kinova (the 'Tenants')
because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 1, 2022. Only
the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Sharon Churcher, attended the hearing. As
of 3:09 p.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice
of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from June 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective October 30, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $274.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants paid $600.00 after
the application was filed.
 
6.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before February 19, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$2,173.26*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 8, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $9.01 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 9, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing*
on or before February 19, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 20, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 19, 2022, then starting
February 20, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 20, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 19, 2022, the Tenants pay
the amount of $2,549.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 20, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
