Prom Chhin Sokhoeum Chhin Sombo Chhin


Tenants




 
 
 
On December 9, 2021 Elmpark Manor
Apts (the 'Landlord') applied in this L4 application for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Sokhoeum Chhin, Sombo Chhin and Prom Chhin (the
'Tenants') and for an order to have the
Tenants pay the rent they owe
because the Tenants failed to meet
a condition specified in the hearing
order issued by the Board on
December 9, 2021 with respect to L1 application TNL-32924-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The hearing order provided
that the Landlord
could apply to the Board under section
78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without
notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the
Tenants did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I find that the Tenants have not
met the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenant has not paid $700.00 arrears
on or before December 3, 2021
and did not pay
$1350.49 rent on or before
December 1, 2021. These were breaches of paragraph
2(a) of the hearing order. This L4 application was filed with the Board within
30 days of the breaches.
 
3.       
The previous L1 application included a request
for an order for the payment
of arrears of rent.
The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or
some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, in this L4
application the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.       
In paragraph 1 of the hearing
order the Tenants
were ordered to pay $9,595.72 for rent arrears and
the costs related to the Landlord's L1 application fee. The Tenant failed to
make any payments so $9,595.72 is still owed from the previous hearing order. That




 
amount has been included in this order. As a result,
the previous order
TNL-32924-21 is cancelled.
 
5.       
Since the date of the hearing
order, the Tenants
have failed to pay the full rent that
became owing.
 
6.       
On April 1, 2020,
the Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,358.05 from the Tenants
and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.       
Interest was last paid out
to the Tenants up to December 31, 2020.
Interest is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January 1, 2021 to January 12, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The previous hearing order TNL-32924-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move
out of the rental
unit on or before
January 23, 2022 (standard 11 days from the
issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $10,075.21*. This amount represents the rent owing up to December 31,
2021 and the costs related to the application fee for the previous L1application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit.
 
4.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the
Landlord $44.40 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
January 1, 2022 to the date the Tenants actually
move out of the rental unit or get evicted.
 
5.       
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
23, 2022, the Tenants will
start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 24, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 23, 2022, then starting January
24, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 24, 2022.

The tenant has until January 22, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 22, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on July 24, 2022 if the order has not been
filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that
has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
