S.T.T.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict S.G.P.
and K.G.P. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.  This is an L1 application.
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenants because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they
permitted in the residential complex have substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or
another tenant; and because they have been persistently late in paying their
rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained
in the unit after the termination date.  This is an L2 application.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on April 3, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenants attended the hearing.  The Landlord’s
daughter, A.T., attended to help her father with translation.
 
Determinations:
APPLICATION
FOR NON-PAYMENT AND PERSISTENTLY LATE RENT 
1.     The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from October 1, 2017 to April 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective January 25, 2018.
2.      The
Tenants have also persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
3.     The
Tenants agreed with the amount outstanding as it is noted in the Update Sheet
provided by the Landlord and that they have been paying their rent late.  The
Tenants asked for a repayment plan to pay the amount off by May 14, 2018.
4.     The
Tenants admittedly have been withholding their rent because they believe the
Landlord had not met their obligations under the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the ‘Act’).  The Tenants have their own application before the Board
currently, which was filed in 2017 and the next hearing is scheduled for April
10, 2018.  
5.     As
I stated at the hearing, the Member hearing that application will determine the
outcome of that application, but the Tenants should not be withholding their
rent.  Any remedy granted in their application will be set out accordingly in
the order after the application is heard in its totality.
6.     The
Tenants believe the Landlord is in serious breach of their obligations and submitted
a copy of text between the parties dated October 2, 2017.  The Landlord is
telling the Tenants that they moved the thermostat to a different location
outside of the Tenants’ unit so they do not bother the Tenants.  The Tenants
believe this to be part of the Landlord’s failure to comply with their
obligations.  I fail to see this as a serious breach of the Landlord’s
obligations.  
7.     The
Tenants further stated that they have two month’s rent available from a family
member but she requires seven to ten days to get the money.  The Tenants also
have a business and instead of paying the Landlord the rent, they invested it
back in the business.  Although the Tenants requested time to take the money
out of the business they provided no evidence of what would have to be done.  
8.     The
Landlord requested termination of the tenancy based on the persistently late
rent.  The amount outstanding is climbing and the Tenants only pay money to the
Landlord when they are forced to by the Board.  
9.     The
Tenants claim that the tenancy should not be terminated based on persistently
late rent because the Landlord’s application for the same was dismissed in
order TEL-79967-17.  After reading this order, it actually states that the
number of payments late at that time does not constitute ‘persistent late’. 
The payments I have before me are more than the 50% claimed in the first Notice
of Termination regarding persistent late.  
10.  The
notice before me lists 10 out of 12 months the Tenants have been late.  Even
after service of the notice the Tenants continue to pay late or not at all.  I
am satisfied the Tenants have persistently paid their rent late.
11.   Regarding
the non-payment of rent, I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.  This allows the Tenants to pay the
amount they have withheld in order to remain in the unit.  If the Tenants fail
to make the payment, the tenancy will be terminated.  If the Tenants comply and
make the payment required, they can remain in the rental unit and pay the
monthly rent on the first of each month as they have claimed they can.
12.   Regarding
the persistently late payments, I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it
would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s)
set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act if
the Tenants void the order for non-payment of rent.
13.   The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,600.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
14.  Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from May 1, 2016 to
January 25, 2018.
APPLCATION
FOR SUBSTANTIAL INTERFERENCE 
15.  The
Landlord served the Tenants with a first Notice of Termination for substantial
interference with the Landlord's and the other tenants' reasonable enjoyment of
the residential complex and with a lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlord.
16.  The
notice shall provide a termination date not earlier than the 20th day after the
notice is given pursuant to subsection 64(2)(a) of the Act.  
17.  In this
case, the Landlord only provided 15 days.  For this reason, the notice is
deemed invalid and this portion of the Landlord’s application is dismissed.
18.  This
order contains all of the reasons for my decision within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.  
It
is ordered that:
APPLICATION
FOR NON-PAYMENT 
1.     Unless
the Tenant voids this part of the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the
rental unit on or before April 21, 2018.
2.     The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $5,280.22*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to April 10, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $53.55 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting April 11, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.     If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before April 21,
2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from April 22, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 21, 2018, then starting April 22, 2018,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 22, 2018.
8.     If,
on or before April 21, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $8,276.40** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.     The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after April 22, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
APPLICATION
FOR PERSISTENT LATE PAYMENT OF RENT
10.   If
the Tenants void the eviction order for non-payment of rent pursuant to
paragraph 8 or 9 above then the Tenants shall pay to
the Landlord new rent on time and in full for the period commencing May 1, 2018
to April 30, 2019. 
11.   If
the Tenants fail to make any one of the payments in accordance with paragraph
10 of this order the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenants, apply to the
Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenants and requiring that the Tenants pay any new arrears,
NSF fees and related charges that became owing after April 30, 2018.
