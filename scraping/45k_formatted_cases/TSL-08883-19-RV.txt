Order under Section 21.2 of the
Statutory Powers
Procedure Act
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-08883-19-RV
 
 
 
Review Order
 
JT (the 'Landlord') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict JS (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation.
 
This application was resolved
by order TSL-08883-19 issued on January
24, 2020.
 
On March 13, 2020, the Tenant requested a review of the order and
that the order be stayed until
the request to review the order is resolved.
 
On March 13, 2020 interim order TSL-08883-19 -IN was issued,
staying the order
issued on January 24, 2020.
 
The request was heard by videoconference on July 20, 2021.
 
Only the Tenant attended
the review hearing
when the matter was called at 9:28am.
 
Determinations:
 
Review Request
 
1.     At the hearing
on July 20, 2021, the Tenant’s
request to review was granted,
the reasons for which were
outlined in interim order TSL-08883-19-RV-IN2, and order TSL-08883-19 issued on
January 24, 2020 was cancelled.
 
2.     A new hearing
was held that day to hear the merits of the Landlord’s application.
 
3.    
The Landlord’s L2 application is based on a N12 notice of termination served to the Tenant on August 20, 2019 with a termination date of October
31, 2019 pursuant
to subsection 48(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006.




 
4.    
Since the Landlord did not appear at the July 20, 2021
hearing to support their
application, I find that this application has been abandoned.
 
Requested Restoration Order
 
5.     The Tenant has been out of possession of the rental
unit since March 12, 2020,
based on his request for
review, after the Sheriff enforced the order and delivered vacant possession to
the Landlord.
 
6.    
At the hearing on July 20, 2021, the Tenant sought an order from the Board allowing him to obtain repossession of
the rental unit.
 
7.    
To ensure the Landlord
had an opportunity to make submissions on the issue
that was not clearly stated
in the request to review, an interim order was issued on January 5, 2022
allowing post-hearing submissions from both parties.
 
8.    
Submissions from the Landlord were
received on January 13, 2022 (due January 14, 2022). Submissions from the Tenant were received on January 20, 2022
(due the same day).
 
9.    
The Landlord submits that the rental
unit is no longer vacant
since the Landlord’s son has moved in, in accordance with the N12 notice of termination that was served to the Tenant as the affiant has
moved into the rental unit.
 
10.  At paragraph 8 of the Tenant’s submissions, the Tenant refers
to three cases
that permit the Board to make
the order that the Tenant requests:












 
11.  I find the Luganda and
Open Hands case
to be relevant to the determinations that must be made in
this matter.
 
12.  Luganda v. Service Hotels Ltd is an English case concerning an appeal that was
dismissed. The facts of this case were: Mr. L had been renting a room on a
weekly basis for three years; when the (hotel) manager advised him the rent
would increase, he failed
to pay the increased amount,
accruing rent arrears. The hotel served two days’ notice requiring
him to vacate his room by 10 o'clock on the Friday. He did not vacate the
premises in accordance with their notice and upon his return to the unit that
day, he found they had changed the locks; shortly thereafter, they rented the
room to someone else.
 
13.  Mr. L applied
for an injunction, which was granted, and he was able to return to his room. Paragraphs 8 and 10 of this
decision found:




 
[8] … Mr. Luganda
had exclusive occupation of the room, that is, the right to occupy it to the exclusion of anyone else
occupying it. He has that right under the
contract. This requirement too is satisfied. …
 
[10]  
…It was unlawful for the management to lock him out of it, see section 30 of the 1965 Act. They were wrong to
take the law into their own hands. If the management had not changed the lock - and Mr. Luganda was
still in occupation - I am sure that the Court would have granted
an injunction to prevent the management from locking
him out. They should not be in a better position by wrongfully locking him out.
…
 
14.  The difference between the case before the Board and Lagunda
is that the Tenant was not locked out of his unit. There was a notice of
termination that was served, an application that was filed, and an order that was issued granting
the Landlord an eviction
order and terminating the tenancy, prior to the Tenant filing his request for
review. The
Tenant’s eviction from the rental
unit was not a unilateral action by the Landlord – it was lawfully obtained,
by the Landlord, by obtaining
a Board order in accordance with the Act. In other words, the Landlord did not
take matters into their own hands, unlike the hotel did, in the Lagunda case.
 
15.  Open Hands is
recent Ontario decision of the Divisional Court where the landlord took matters
into their hands and locked out the tenant from their rental unit. The landlord
submitted that they did not know they were subject to the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006. The tenant
commenced proceedings before
the Board pursuant
to section 29 of the Act, which included a request for an
order of reinstatement of possession to his rental unit.
 
16.  In the Open
Hands, the Divisional Court discussed at paragraphs 11-13 the importance of determining whether the landlord lawfully evicted the tenant
in accordance with the Act:
 
[11]  
An important feature of the Act is
security of tenure for tenants. Subsection
37(1) stipulates that a tenancy may only
be terminated in accordance with the
Act. Importantly for purposes of
the present appeal, s. 39 states that a landlord can only recover possession of a rental
unit subject to a
tenancy if the tenant has
vacated or abandoned the rental unit, or the Board has made an order
evicting the tenant.
 
[12]  
The Act sets out the grounds
on which a landlord may seek an eviction order – for example, the non-payment of rent (s. 59) or the tenant’s
substantial interference with
the the landlord’s or other tenants’ reasonable enjoyment of the residential
complex (s. 64). Importantly, the
landlord must initiate a proceeding under the Act and give proper notice to the
tenant using the forms authorized by the Board. In some situations, the tenant may then have an opportunity
to correct the offending conduct and void the notice (see, for example, ss.
59(3) and 62(3)).
 
[13]  
If the matter proceeds to a
hearing, the Board must decide if there are grounds for termination of the
tenancy. If so, the Board must then consider whether to order
eviction, as s. 83(1)(a) states that the Board may “refuse to grant the application unless satisfied, having
regard to all the circumstances, that it would




 
be unfair to refuse.”
If the Board decides to refuse to order eviction, it may impose conditions (s. 204).
 
[Emphasis added.]
 
17.  In the case before me, the uncontested evidence before
the Board was on August 20, 2019, the Landlord served the Tenant with an N12
notice of termination pursuant to section 48 of the Act, and the Landlord then
filed this application at the Board the following day. Although the Tenant
disputes receiving the N12 notice, the Tenant also testified that he returned
the one month’s compensation the Landlord paid to him pursuant to section 48.1 of the Act, because
he believed the notice was improper.
I find it highly unlikely that the Landlord would have paid the Tenant
one month’s compensation but not have served the Tenant with the N12 notice.
The requirement to pay compensation under section 48.1 only arises after an N12
notice has been served on a Tenant.
 
18.  The Tenant further
submitted that the Landlord initially
served him a letter dated February
22, 2019 with a termination date of April 28, 2019, which the Tenant signed,
confirming receipt on February 29, 2019. So the Tenant has been aware of the
Landlord’s intention to regain possession of the rental unit since at least
February 2019.
 
19.   A hearing was held by the Board on December 6, 2019 to
consider the Landlord’s application. The Tenant did not attend and an eviction
order was issued by the Board
on January 24, 2020, granting a delay in the termination the tenancy to
February 15, 2020. The request to review was filed by the Tenant over a month
later after the Sheriff had already enforced the order (March 12, 2020). The
Tenant submits this was due to his discovery that he missed the Board’s
proceedings and order on the date the order was enforced. However, Sheriff’s
notices provide more than 24 hours written notice of the entry prior to the
enforcement of the order.
 
20.  As such, unlike
the circumstances in Lagunda and Open Hands, the Landlord lawfully evicted the Tenant by following the process contained
in the Act and enforcing
a valid eviction order issued by the Board.
 
21.  I do not find that there has been an abuse of the
Board’s process or the enforcement process, by the Landlord.
I say this as there is no evidence before
me that the Landlord ought to
have, or did have, knowledge of the Tenant’s inability to attend the hearing on
December 6, 2019 or that the Tenant did not receive the notice of hearing
and/or order issued by the Board.
 
22.  In my opinion the wording of subsection 23(1) of the
SPPA makes it clear that the provision is designed
to give the Board the power to prevent any abuse of process, not only an abuse caused by the opposing
party.
 
23.  Logically, where a tenant successfully argues, on a
review, that she or he was not reasonably able
to participate in the hearing,
and the Board’s order has been enforced
by the Sheriff but the unit remains vacant, I believe that the Board does have
the jurisdiction to order that tenant back into possession, once the review is
granted, in order to prevent an abuse of process. This is especially so as, upon a
successful review request,
the initial




 
order is null, the tenancy
between the parties has not been terminated, and the tenant retains the right
to possession of the unit by virtue of the tenancy agreement. However, this may not be where
a new tenant or, in this case, the Landlord’s son, is in possession
of the unit.
 
24.  Given the above, I find that the Board lacks the
jurisdiction to grant the Tenant’s request to
return possession of the rental
unit to the Tenant since he was lawfully
evicted, and the rental unit is no longer vacant. No
further submissions were provided by the Tenant to counter the Landlord’s
submission with respect to the status of the rental unit. As such, the Tenant’s
request must be denied.
 
25.  This order contains
all of the reasons for the
decision within it. No further
reasons shall be issued.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The request to review
order TSL-08883-19 issued
on January 24, 2020 is
granted and replaced with the
following order.
 
2.    
The interim orders issued on March 13, 2020 and January 5, 2022 are
cancelled.
 
3.     The Landlord’s L2 application is dismissed as abandoned.
