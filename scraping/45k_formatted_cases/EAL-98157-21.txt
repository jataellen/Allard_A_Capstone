Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-98157-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


121, 324 CAMBRIDGE STREET N OTTAWA ON
  K1R7B5


 




Between:


Jennifer Davies
Primecorp Property Manager


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Roxann Draper


Tenant



 
 
 
Jennifer Davies and Primecorp
Property Manager (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Roxann
Draper (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant,
another occupant of the rental unit or a person the Tenant permitted in
the residential complex has seriously impaired the safety of any person.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653#
on January 26, 2022.
 
Only the Landlords, Jennifer
Davie attended the hearing. September Whitman attended as witness for the Landlord.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord’s witness, September Whitman (SW)
testified the Tenant has threatened her with bodily harm on September 23, 2021
when she told the Tenant had to pay for a replacement key. SW testified she called police and locked herself in her office because
she feared the Tenant when she kicked the window and door.
 
2.    
In Furr
v. Courtland Mews Cooperative Housing
Inc., 2020 ONSC 1175, at paragraph 17, the Court states:
[17] …the
Divisional Court made it clear that serious impairment of safety includes both actual impairment and a real risk of impairment. In other cases,
the Board has held
that it is not necessary
that anyone has actually been hurt or injured and that a serious impairment of safety may
include: the potential for an outcome that has the risk of a substantial
negative effect on a person’s well-being; a foreseeable act or omission that
could result in or may result in a serious impairment to safety; and extremely
loud and intense arguments could easily result in violence and would be a
safety hazard.




File Number: EAL-98157-21
 
3.    
Based on the uncontested testimony from SW, I find the Tenant’s
actions could have resulted in a serious impairment to
safety.
 
4.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
5.     SW testified another occurrence took place about a
week ago where the Tenant kicked the window and door of her office where she
again had to call police. The Tenant’s behaviour according to the Landlord has not changed
after the N7 Notice was issued and she fears for her staff and other
tenants’ safety in the residential complex. The
Tenant did not attend the hearing to refute the Landlord’s evidence or make
submissions to preserve the tenancy.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
February 12, 2022. The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before February 12, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 12, 2022, then starting February
13, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after February 13, 2022. The Sheriff
is requested to expedite the enforcement of this order.
