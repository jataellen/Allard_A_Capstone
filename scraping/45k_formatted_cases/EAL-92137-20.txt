In the matter

10, 35 ADAMS STREET CORNWALL ON K6J2V8


 




Between:


Jerome Mcdonnell

Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Barbar
Aka Barbara Mcutchean Aka Barbara
  Mcleary Aka Barbara Cleary


Tenant



 
 
 
Jerome Mcdonnell
and William Lang (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Barbar Aka Barbara Mcutchean
Aka Mcleary Aka Cleary (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on October 20, 2021. The Landlord, William Lang, attended and was represented by
Denis Sabourin. As of 9:40 a.m. the
Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing
as it appears from the
Certificate of Service.
 
Prior to the hearing
the Landlord requested
the Application be amended to include the name
Barbara Cleary. The request to amend
the application was granted.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 Application
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
August 1, 2020 to October 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective
September 21, 2020.
 
2.    
The Tenant
is in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is
$900.00.
 
4.    
The arrears
of rent owing
for the period
ending October 31, 2021 as of the date
of hearing was $12, 600.00.




 
5.    
The Landlord
incurred costs of $201.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
 
6.    
The Landlords collected a rent deposit of $900.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlords.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from February 1, 2020 to September 21, 2020.
 
8.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
the Act.
 
L2 Application
 
9.    
The application is based on a voidable
Notice of Termination (N5) served on the Tenant on September 1, 2020 with a
termination date of September 21, 2020 because the Tenant, occupants of the
rental unit or persons permitted at the residential complex by the Tenant
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential
complex and the lawful rights, privileges and interests of the Landlords and/or
other Tenants by causing disturbances by
swearing, yelling leaving the laundry room in a mess and smoking marihuana and
cigarettes in a non smoking building.
 
10.  The Landlord provided oral testimony that
was short on details and recall. He
did not have notes to assist his testimony. He
suggested that there were just so many occurrences that he could not recall each one specifically. With some prompting
from the N5 he recalled
attending the residential complex, in August 2020, in response to a complaint
from other Tenants and finding furniture strewn about the lawn, alleged thrown
form the Tenant’s balcony. The police
were in attendance. Guests were still
arguing on the balcony when he arrived.
 
11.  The N5 references an occurrence of August 8
which states “Tenant threatens William Lang
he is going to die and says fuck you.” In his testimony the Landlord
says that it did not happened
to him but rather happened to his maintenance man. He related how a guest of the Tenant jumped off the balcony to a
lower balcony and then to the ground, continuing to yell threats.
 
12.  The Landlord recalls
the Tenant swearing
at him on August 12, 2020 when he
approached her about overdue rent.
 
13.  The Landlord testified on August 19, 2020
as a result of a tenant complaint he attended the rental complex and found the Tenant had left piles of clothes
strewn about the laundry
room for several days. The Landlord
was required to clean up the clothes.
 
14.  Finally,
in August 2020 the Tenant and/or her guests were smoking weed and cigarettes in the rental unit, contrary to
the rules of the residential complex. The
Landlord stated this is a regular occurrence.




 
 
 
15.  The Landlords application is dismissed. The N5 notice of termination lacks the requisite detail outlined in s. 43(2) of
the Act.
 
16.  The details contained in a notice was
addressed by the Divisional Court in Ball v. Metro Capital Property
which says that a notice
of termination given by a landlord must “set out the
reasons and details
respecting the termination”. The Court concluded the
purpose of the notice was to ensure
the tenant knew the case to be met and was in a position to decide whether or
not to dispute the allegations at a hearing. The Court concluded that
the kinds of
particulars that should be contained in a notice which was about a tenant’s
behaviour should include
“dates and times
of the alleged offensive conduct
together with a detailed
description of the alleged conduct engaged in by the tenant.”
 
17.  The furniture incident is alleged to have taken place during the week of July 19, 2020 and the smoking is alleged to have
occurred during the month of August, 2020. The
laundry room incident is alleged to have occurred on August 19, but the details
regarding the mess are sorely
lacking. Each of theses matters
falls far short of the requirements as set
out in Ball v. Metro Capital.
 
18.  Of particular note in this matter is the fact that the incident of August 8, 2020 was not
about the Tenant threatening the Landlord at all, but rather the Tenant’s guest
threatening a maintenance man. This incident was misrepresented in the Notice.
 
19.  Based on the content of the N5, I am not satisfied
the Tenant would have understood the allegations being made against her. For this reason the Application related to the N5 is dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The applications shall be amended
to include the name Barbara
Cleary.
 
2.    
The L2 Application related
to the Notice of Termination (N5) is dismissed.
 
3.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords
and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 18, 2022.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlords $14,604.76 (less any rent paid to the Landlord after October
20, 2021)*, which represents the amount of rent owing
and compensation up to
January 7, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the
rent deposit.
 
5.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlords $29.59
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 8, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
6.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlords $201.00
for the cost of filing
the application.




 
7.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before January
18, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 19, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
8.    
If the unit is not vacated on or before January
18, 2022, then starting January
19, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after January 19, 2022.
 
10.  If, on or before January 18, 2022, the
Tenant pays the amount of $16,401.00** to the Landlords or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time,
the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
11.

The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
19, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
