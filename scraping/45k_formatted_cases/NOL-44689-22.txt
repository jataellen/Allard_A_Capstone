Sioux Lookout Non-Profit Housing

Determinations:

Tenant's tenancy effective December 12, 2021 and the Tenant did not move out of the rental
unit by the termination

$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
February 13, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
February 14, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 13, 2022, then starting February
14, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
