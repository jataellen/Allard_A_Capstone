Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19634-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


MAIN FLOOR, 874
SANOK DRIVE PICKERING ON
  L1W2R4


 




Between:


Nick Chimienti


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Dany White Ian Houston


Tenants



 
 
Nick Chimienti (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ian Houston
and Dany White (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 5, 2022. Only the Landlord
attended the hearing. As of
2:25 p.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from August
1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective September 16, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
were in possession of the rental
unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $2,000.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $2,000.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from July 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020.
 
6.    
The Tenants
paid $8,700.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenants, and find
that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 28, 2022.
 
2.    
As of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears
of rent and compensation the
Landlord is entitled to by $13.14*.
 
3.    
However, the Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenants: $65.75
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 18, 2022 to
the date the Tenants move out of the unit, and $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.    
The Landlord
or the Tenants shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 29, 2022.
 
7.    
If, on or before
January 28, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $3,036.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be
void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
8.    
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after January
29, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once
during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
 
January 17, 2022                                                                                 Date Issued                                                                       Richard Ferriss
