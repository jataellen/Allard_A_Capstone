In the matter
of:


204 HENDERSON LOOP ROAD ROAD DRYDEN ON P8N3G2


 




Between:


Tracy Chevrier


Tenant




 


 
and


 




 


Leslie Snell
  Lorne Snell


Landlord Agents



 
 
 
Tracy Chevrier (the 'Tenant')
applied for an order determining that Leslie Snell and Lorne Snell (the
'Landlords') harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with the
Tenant, substantially interfered with
the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenant or by a member
of the Tenant's household and withheld or deliberately interfered with the reasonable supply of a vital service, care service, or
food that the Landlords are obligated to supply under the tenancy agreement.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 18, 2021.
The Tenant and the Landlords attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant alleged that the rental unit was in a state
of disrepair and had a mice infestation. These are maintenance issues.
The Tenant has not filed a maintenance application therefore those
issues cannot be addressed in this application.
 
2.     The Tenant and the Landlords entered into a tenancy
agreement after the Tenant viewed the property. The Tenant agreed to pay for all utilities. This included propane,
wood for a wood stove and electricity. The Tenant was informed that the propane
supplier would fill the tank whenever the tank reached 30 per cent capacity. The Tenant had difficulty operating the stove in the unit and was upset when the propane
tank was filled
at the cost of $918.50 after 8 weeks.
Consequently, the Tenant filed this application to terminate the tenancy. The Landlords agreed to let the Tenant out of the
lease.
 
3.     The Tenant is not entitled
to a remedy. Pursuant to the tenancy
agreement, the Tenant agreed to pay the cost of
utilities. It is normal for heating costs to rise during cold weather, but
costs go down as the weather gets warmer. The fact that the Landlords




File Number: NOT-41351-20
 
agreed to terminate that tenancy does not mean the Tenant is entitled
to terminate the tenancy. Thus, the Tenant is not
entitled to moving costs.
 
4.     The Tenant also claimed compensation for damage to her
four-wheeler when a tree branch fell on it. The Tenant blamed
the Landlords for not cutting
down the trees on the property. The Landlords are not liable for the damage. The Tenant is
responsible for insuring her property against damage.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant's application is dismissed.
