and


 




 


Jennifer L O'neill Nathaniel B Lacasse


Tenants



 
 
 
Reza Ramezani
and Ronya Valizadeh (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Jennifer L O'neill and Nathaniel B Lacasse (the 'Tenants')
because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in
the residential complex have used the rental unit or the residential complex in
a manner that is inconsistent with use as a residential premises and that has
caused or can be expected to cause significant damage; and because they,
another occupant of the rental unit or a person the Tenants permitted in the
residential complex have seriously impaired
the safety of any person.
The Landlords also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date. (N7 notice)
 
The Landlords also applied for an
order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants because the Tenants,
another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenants permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlord or another tenant (N5 notice)
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 18, 2022.
 
Ronya Valizadeh, on behalf of the Landlords and Jennifer L O'neill , on behalf
of the Tenants attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Preliminary Issues
 
N7 notice of eviction
 
1.     The N7 notice indicates Reason 3, that the Tenant or
an occupant are using the rental unit or residential complex in a way that is
inconsistent with its use as residential premises and this has caused or is expected
to cause serious
damage. Non of the details




 
in the notice pertain
to use inconstant to that of a residential unit or property, therefore, this part of the application must be dismissed.
 
2.     The N7 notice also includes Reason 4: the Tenants live
in the same building as the Landlord; the building has 3 or fewer residential
units; and, the Tenants’ behaviour has caused
substantial interference to the Landlord. The Landlord confirmed that they do not
live in the same building, therefore this part of the application must be
dismissed.
 
3.    
With respect to the particulars in the N7 notice, the August 26, 2021 incident
is in regard to the Tenants walking at 12 a.m. in the neighbourhood
and pointing camera phone
towards people’s property. As
this behaviour is not taking place on the residential property, the Residential Tenancies
Act 2006, (‘the
Act’) does not apply. Section 66(1)(b) of the Act states that the
act or omission must take place in the residential complex.
 
4.    
The N7 notice indicates
that on October 8, 2021 the Landlords
received texts and calls from neighbours about loud music and screaming, and that they were angry about their sleep being disturbed. These
particulars do not describe serious impairment of safety; therefore, this part
of the application must be dismissed.
 
5.     The N7 also notes an incident August 25, 2021, whereby
the Tenants entered the back yard at 11 p.m. without permission of the upper
tenants which disturbed and made them feel unsafe. When questioned as to how
this was impairment of safety, the Landlord testified that the upper tenants
emailed them about the incident and said they felt scared. As the upper unit
tenants were not present and the email is not in evidence this part of the application must also be dismissed due to lack of evidence. According to the caselaw, the cogency of the evidence
should be commensurate with the gravity of the allegations (Bogey
Construction Ltd. v. Boileau (24 April 2002), Court File No. 01-DV-606
(Ont. Div. Ct.)); here there is only hearsay.
 
N5 notice of eviction
 
6.     The application is based
in part on two Notices
of Termination that the Landlord
served upon the Tenant. In both notices, the Landlords are claiming the
Tenants have substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the
residential complex for all usual purposes by the landlord or another tenant
due to behaviour issues.
 
7.    
The Certificate of
Service for the 1st N5 notice indicates that on August 24,
2021 the N5 and N7 notices
were mailed to the Tenants as well as emailed.
According to Rule 3 of the
Board’s Rules of Practice, when a document is mailed it is deemed served on the
5th day after mailing. Here, that means
the 1st N5 was deemed served August 29, 2021,
which is only 17 days from the termination date. Section 64(2) of the Act
requires that the termination must be a minimum of 20 days from the sate the
notice was serve.
 
8.    
However, section
191(2) of the Act says a “notice or document that is not given in accordance with this section
shall be deemed
to have been validly given if it is proven that its contents actually
came to the attention of the person for whom it was intended
within the required time period”.




 
 
 
9.    
The Tenant testified that the Landlord
emailed on October
25, 2021 that this was a formal written warning. Prior to that
email she did not receive any notices from the Landlord; they all came at once attached
to the October 25th email. With respect to the 1st N5 being mailed, they received both N5s and the N7 notice at
the same time in October. The Tenant also testified that they received the
email form the Board with all of the hearing information, the application and
the notices in November 2021.
 
10. 
The Landlord
testified that the Tenant is confusing when she got the notice
because a number of notices
have been served; there were 2 sets of N5s, a N4 and a N8. With respect to this
application, the 1st N5 was sent via Purolator and the 2nd was sent via Canada Post. When the courier
could not deliver
the notice directly
to the Tenants thy brought
the package to the upper tenants; the upper tenants put the package in the
mailbox the Tenants can access.
 
11. 
For the reasons
that follow, based on all of the evidence and testimony before me, I find on a
balance of probabilities that the Tenants did not receive the 1st N5 notice at least 20 days after the notice was served.
Therefore, as the 1st N5 does not comply with section 64(2), I find it to be invalid and the
Landlord’s application must be denied;
the 1st N5 must be valid for
the application to proceed on a 2nd N5.
 
12.  The Certificates of Service indicate
the following:
 
•        
Re 1st N5: August 24, 2021 N5 and N7 mailed and emailed to Tenants.
•        
Re 2nd N5: October 8, 2021 N5 and N7 mailed and email to Tenants.
•        
Re N7: October 8, 2021 N5 and N7 mailed and email to Tenants.
 
13.  The Certificates of Service are confusing as they show the N7 being served
twice. The service documents also indicate that all notices were sent by mail,
which is contrary to the Landlord’s testimony. Therefore, I find the best evidence before
me is the Tenant’s
testimony that she did not receive
an email from the Landlord
in August regarding
the 1st N5 and that all notices were
received at the same time, in October 2021.
 
Merits
 
14.  The matter did not proceed
to a merits hearing as the application was dismissed on preliminary issues.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlords' application is dismissed.
