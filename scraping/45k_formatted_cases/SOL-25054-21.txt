Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-25054-21
 



In the matter of:


16 ALBERT
  STREET WELLAND ON L3B4L2


 




Between:


Rachel Morgan


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Anthony Wright


Tenant



 
 
Rachel Morgan
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Anthony Wright (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on January 18, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s Legal Representative,
Josh McDougall, attended the hearing. As of 10:41 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
The Landlord’s Representative
indicated that a payment agreement had been submitted to the Board in the days
prior to the hearing. They indicated that they were still in agreement with
that repayment plan and requested an order to formalize the payments. As there is no prejudice
to the Tenant in issuing an
order to this effect the order will reflect the agreement which had been submitted.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period
from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 26, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent for the unit increased
to $930.84.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant paid $1,340.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction subject to the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$3,479.04, which represents the arrears of rent
($3,293.04), and costs ($186.00) outstanding for the period ending January 31,
2022.
 
2.     The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant
is denied on the condition
that:
 
(a)   The
Tenant shall make the following payments to the Landlord in respect of the
monies owing under paragraph 1 of this order:
 



Date Payment Due

(b)  
The Tenant shall also pay the Landlord the rent for the months of
February 2022 up to and including
May 2022 in full, on or before the first day of each corresponding month.
 
3.    
If the Tenant fails to make any of the payments
in accordance with paragraph 2, and by
the dates required, then:
 
(a)  
The Landlord may apply under
section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an
order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, and for the payment of
any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not already ordered under paragraph 1
of this order. The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a
breach of a condition set out in paragraph 2 of this order.




 
(b)  
The balance owing under paragraph
1 of this order shall become payable on the day following the date of default. The monies owing shall bear interest at the
post-judgment interest rate determined under subsection 207(7) of the Act.
