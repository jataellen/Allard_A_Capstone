Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-01549-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


18 MARKET ST TARA
ON N0H2N0


 




Between:


Nathaniel Stewart


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Tyler Roote


Tenant



 
 
 
Nathaniel Stewart (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tyler Roote (the 'Tenant') because
the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard
on February 10, 2022. Only the Landlord
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord in good faith requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
2.     The Tenant has not paid rent since March 2021. The Landlord paid the Tenant compensation equal to one month's rent by informing the Tenant the arrears would be
reduce by one month that is owing.
 
3.     This matter was previously adjourned because the Tenant
claimed to have a medical emergency. The Tenant was ordered to supply the Board with evidence of the
emergency. The Tenant did not file
any evidence with the Board.
 
4.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of February
25, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 25, 2022.




File Number: CEL-01549-21
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 25, 2022, then starting February
26, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 26, 2022.
