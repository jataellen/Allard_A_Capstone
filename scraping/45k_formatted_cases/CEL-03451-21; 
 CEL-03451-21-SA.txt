Order under Section 78(11)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-03451-21-SA
 
 



In the matter
of:


UPPER LEVEL, 25 GORDON DRIVE BRAMPTON ON L6Y2A8


 




Between:


Leonard Seecharan


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Wendy Wright


Tenant



 
 
Leonard Seecharan (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Wendy Wright (the 'Tenant')
and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent she owes because
the Tenant failed to meet a
condition specified in the order
issued by the Board on June 7,
2021 with respect to application CEL-96847-20.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved by ex parte order CEL-03451-21, issued on November
23, 2021. The Tenant filed a motion to set aside order CEL-03451-21.
 
This motion was heard by videoconference on January 26, 2022.
 
The Tenant and the Landlord’s Agent,
Andrea Seecharan, attended
the hearing. The Tenant had initially joined the conference
bridge but dropped off abruptly. At
10:03 am, I commenced the hearing without the Tenant, but just after I had
completed the hearing, the Tenant had reappeared on the conference bridge and I re-admitted her to the hearing room. The Tenant
was able to consult with the Tenant Duty Counsel prior to the
commencement of the hearing, which was then held with both parties present.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     It was established without dispute that currently, the Tenant owes a total of $1,186.00
in rent arrears (including costs) to the Landlord for the period ending
January 31, 2022.
 
2.     There was no dispute about the Tenant missing the
October 2021 rent payment which had been due on October 1, 2021. The Landlord’s
Agent also confirmed that December 2021 and January
2022 rents were paid a few days ago by the Tenant,
and the payments cleared successfully.
 
3.     The Tenant testified
about the circumstances that contributed to her breaches
of the June 7, 2021 Board order, and the late payments of rent for
December and January 2021.
She and her son live in the
rental unit. The Tenant stated her
son lost his job in September 2021, and had to go on Employment Insurance, which disrupted their ability to




 
make the ordered payments on
time. The Tenant also explained that
she has not been working, in part because she suffers from depression and other related
effects due to the
loss of her other son.
 
4.    
The Tenant provided testimony that she was in mid-process of securing the balance
owing ($1,186.00), and detailed how she was coming to secure that money. She submitted she could pay the full
amount on or before January 28, 2022.
 
5.     As she has been living
in the rental unit for the past 17 years,
the Tenant requested
that her motion be granted and the stay lifted.
 
6.     The Landlord’s Agent testified that the Landlord has
been very sympathetic to the personal tragedy and issues the Tenant has had to
deal with. However, the Landlord’s
Agent stated the Landlord has been before
the Board about
a half dozen times in the past few years which has placed great
strain on the Landlord as well. The
Landlord’s Agent confirmed the Landlord would request the motion be denied, but
the Landlord was agreeable to giving some additional time to the Tenant to move
out.
 
7.     The Tenant also explained her need for additional time if her motion were to be
denied.
 
8.     Based on the submissions of the parties
who both provided
straightforward testimonies, I indicated that I was prepared to
consider granting the motion to set aside, on one condition. I directed the Tenant to make good on her
stated promise to pay the
$1,186.00
on/before January 28, 2022. If this
were done, I indicated I would find in favour
of the Tenant; if this were not done, I indicated I would deny the motion
and then postpone the lifting of the stay as requested
by both parties. The Tenant
confirmed her intention to
comply by January 28th.
 
9.     I set a deadline of 5:00 pm on January 31, 2022 for
the Landlord to send written confirmation to the Board whether
the Tenant paid the $1,186.00 on/before January 28, 2022.
If the Landlord were to send no reply, I indicated that I would take
that as a ‘positive’ submission, meaning
that I would find the Tenant paid the full amount on time.
 
10.  I can confirm that nothing was sent into the Board by the Landlord
on or before 5:00 pm,
January 31, 2022. In fact, as of the
date this order has issued, nothing has been received by the Board from the
Landlord, or from the Tenant for that matter, after the January 26, 2022
hearing.
 
11.  I find the Tenant has met the payment condition
I set at the motion
hearing. Therefore, the
Tenant’s motion to set aside is to be granted.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant’s motion
to set aside is granted.
 
2.     Ex parte order CEL-03451-21, issued on November 23, 2021 is set aside. An order
that is set aside cannot be enforced.




 
3.    
Order CEL-96847-20 issued on June 7, 2021 remains
in effect.
