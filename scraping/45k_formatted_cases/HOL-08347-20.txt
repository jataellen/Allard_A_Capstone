Daniel Heenan
  Lauren Tilly


Tenants



 
 
Harsha Perera and Shanika
Perera (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Daniel Heenan and Lauren Tilly (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This hearing was held by
videoconference on January 6, 2022. The
Landlords and the Landlords’ representative, Goby Arumai, attended
the hearing. One Tenant, Daniel
Heenan, and the Tenants’
representative, Carrie Aylwin, also attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     On August 8, 2020 the Landlords served the Tenants
with an N4 Notice of Termination (N4) with a termination date of August
23, 2020. The N4 seeks termination of the tenancy on the ground that the Tenants
have not paid rent.
 
2.    
The Landlords filed this application to evict the Tenants to the Board on September
16, 2020.
 
3.     The parties agree that the Tenants vacated the rental
unit on October 31, 2020. Therefore, the Tenants
were in possession of the rental unit on the date the application
was filed.
 
4.     The monthly rent was $2300.00. The Tenants did not pay rent for the months of June, July, August
and September 2020 – for a total of $9200.00
in rent arrears.
The Landlords requested
compensation for rent arrears of $9200.00, as well as payment of $186.00 for
the L1 application fee.
 
5.     The Landlords testified
that the Tenants’
rent deposit of $2300.00 was used for their rent payment for the month of October
2020, and that no interest was owing on this deposit.




 
6.    
The Landlords noted that in August
2020 efforts were made to negotiate an agreement
with the Tenants for the payment of arrears, but they
could not reach a
consensus with the Tenants regarding
an appropriate payment plan.
 
7.    
The Tenant agreed that he owes the Landlords
rent arrears of $9200.00. The Tenant
requested a payment plan to pay for these arrears.
 
8.     The parties agreed on a payment plan requiring the
Tenants pay $450.00 on or before the first day of every
month until the balance is paid, and if the Tenants do not pay the full amount of $450.00 on or before the
first day of each month, then the balance of rent arrears owing would be due on
or before the first day of the next month.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy terminated on October 31, 2020, the day the Tenants vacated
the rental unit.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords the sum of
$9200.00 which represents the amount of rent owing from June
1, 2020 to September 30, 2020. The Tenants shall also
pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the
cost of filing the application. The payment of these arrears and
the application fee, for a total of $9386.00, shall be made on or before the
first day of each month as follows:
 
a)       March 1, 2022 - $450.00;
b)       April 1, 2022 - $450.00;

3.    
If the Tenants do not pay the
Landlords the full amount of $450.00 on or before the first day of each month,
as per paragraph 2 above, then the balance of the rent arrears and application
fee will be due on or before the first day of the next month. The Tenants will start to owe interest on
this balance from the second day of the month following a payment default.
This will be simple interest
calculated at 2.00% annually
on the balance outstanding.
