Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-25987-22
 



In the matter
of:


25, 11 CROWN HILL
PLACE TORONTO ON M8Y4C6


 




Between:


Springhill Investment Inc


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Billi Jacquelin Cope Jeremy Denis Dyer


Tenants



 
 
Springhill Investment Inc (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Billi Jacquelin
Cope and Jeremy
Denis Dyer (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants gave a notice
to terminate the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     On November 1, 2021, the Tenants gave the Landlord an
email message informing the Landlord that the Tenants will terminate their
tenancy “by end of December”.                                                                                                                      The Landlord accepted the Tenants’ email
message to terminate the tenancy. The
Tenants confirmed with the Landlord that they meant December 31, 2021 when they wrote “end of December” in the November 1, 2021 email
message.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants gave the Landlord a notice to
terminate the tenancy effective December 31, 2021. Although the Tenants did not use the Board-approved Form N9
notice of termination, their November 1, 2021 email message to the Landlord
identifies the rental unit and clearly
expresses their intention to end their
tenancy with the Landlord.
The Landlord accepted the Tenants’ November 1, 2021 notice to terminate the
tenancy, and the parties confirmed by email the December 31, 2021 date of
termination.
 
3.     I therefore conclude that the Tenants gave the
Landlord a notice of termination on November
1, 2021, which notice the Landlord accepted.
The parties addressed any uncertainty that may have arisen from the Tenants’ vague
description of “end of December” as the date of termination, confirming the
Tenants’ intention to end the tenancy effective December 31, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 1, 2022.




File Number: TSL-25987-22
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 1, 2022, then starting February
2, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 2, 2022.
