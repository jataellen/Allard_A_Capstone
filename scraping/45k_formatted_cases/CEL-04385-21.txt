  matter of:

LOGGERS RUN BARRIE ON L4N7K1

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Brittany Wirag


Tenant



 
 
 
Nurit Sussman (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Brittany Wirag (the
'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified in the order
issued by the Board on November 1, 2021 with respect to application
CEL-94992-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following condition
specified in the order: the Tenant did not pay the lawful
rent for December on or before
December 20, 2021.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the
Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment
of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$26,891.00 for rent arrears in Order CEL-94992-20. The amount that is still owing from that order is $26,891.00 and that amount is included
in this order. As a result,
the portion of the previous order
CEL-94992-20 related to rent arrears is cancelled.
 
5.     The Tenancy was terminated by the order CEL-94992-20 issued November 01, 2021 and remains in full force and effect.
 
It is ordered that:




File Number: CEL-04385-21
 
1.    
The previous order CEL-94992-20 paragraphs 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9 are cancelled. The remainder of the order remains in effect
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $28,351.00. This amount represents the rent owing up to December 31, 2021.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $48.00 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
January 31, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
February 01, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.

The tenant has until January 28, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 28, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction

the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
