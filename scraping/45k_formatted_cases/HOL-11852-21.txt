Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: HOL-11852-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


13, 740 LINDEN DRIVE CAMBRIDGE ON N3H0E3


 




Between:


Pensio Property Management Group Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Javan
  Thomas


Tenant



 
 
Pensio Property Management Group Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict Javan Thomas (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 16, 2021. Only the Landlord's Representative, Thomas
Schlenleber, attended the hearing. As
of 2:40 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board. The Landlord also
sent the Tenant a package containing the Notice of Hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from May 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective August
22, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $2,100.00.
 
4.     The Tenant paid $300.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
sent an email to the Tenant on the necessity of a repayment agreement. The
Landlord’s attempts at negotiating a repayment agreement were unsuccessful.
 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $2,100.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period from December 18, 2020
to December 31, 2020.
 
8.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including
the impact of COVID-19 on the




 
parties and whether the
Landlord attempted to negotiate a
repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act. The
amount outstanding is substantial, and the Tenants have not paid a full month’s
rent since the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the
Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before January 17, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $13,395.94*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 6, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay
to the Landlord $69.04 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 7, 2022 to the date the
Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 17, 2022, the
Tenant will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 18, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January 18, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
January 18, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 17, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $17,306.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be
terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after
January 18, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
