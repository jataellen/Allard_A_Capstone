File Number: CEL-97490-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


1008, 430 MCMURCHY AVENUE
S BRAMPTON ON L6Y2N4


 




Between:


Oxford Properties Group


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Deandre Reid Bailey Kimaya Malcolm


Tenants



 
 
 
Oxford Properties Group (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Kimaya Malcolm (‘KM’) and Deandre Reid Bailey (‘DB’, the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in
video conference room 84 on June 21, 2021 and in video conference room 125 on December 7,
2021.
 
The Landlord’s agent, R. Milicer,
the Landlord’s representatives, F. McGregor and M. Zarnett, and the Tenant KM attended the hearing
on June 21, 2021. Only the Landlord’s agent and the Landlord’s representative M. Zarnett
attended the hearing
on December 7, 2021. The Tenants
did not attend the December 7, 2021 proceedings for the duration of the hearing
block.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants did not prove that they were not in possession of the rental
unit when the Landlord filed its application with
the Board on December 11, 2020.
 
2.     The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from October 1, 2020 to
January 31, 2021. Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
November 9, 2020.
 
3.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,706.72
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
4.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
1, 2020 to November 9, 2020.




File Number: CEL-97490-20
 
5.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
6.     The Tenants gave the Landlord
a notice on November 12, 2020 to terminate the tenancy
effective January 31, 2021. The
Landlord accepted the Tenants’ notice.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants moved out of the rental unit
effective January 31, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$4,369.93*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 31, 2021, less
the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January 29, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 30, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
