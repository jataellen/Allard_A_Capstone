In the
matter of:


406, 340 THE EAST MALL ETOBICOKE ON M9B3Z6


 




Between:


IMH POOL VI LP


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


William Cronin


Tenant



 
 
IMH POOL VI LP (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict William Cronin (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges
and related administration charges.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 12, 2022. The
Landlord's Legal Representative, Sara Mathew,
and the Tenant attended the hearing. The Tenant
spoke with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The total rent for the period from March 1, 2021 to
January 31, 2022 has not been paid. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice
of Termination effective August 22, 2021.
 
2.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,447.64.
 
3.     The Landlord incurred
charges of $20.00 for cheques
tendered by or on behalf
of the Tenant, which were
returned NSF and $80.00 for related administration charges.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,445.06 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     $1,453.04 was paid to the Landlord after the application was filed.
 
6.     The amount outstanding to January 31, 2022, inclusive of rent arrears
($7,182.80), NSF charges
($100.00) and costs ($186.00), is $7,468.80.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a
repayment agreement, and




 
find that it would
not be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of
the Act as set out below.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $7,468.80, which represents the arrears of rent ($7,182.80), NSF charges ($100.00) and costs ($186.00) outstanding for the period ending January 31, 2022.
 
2.     The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant
is denied on the condition
that:
 
(a)  
The Tenant shall make the following payments to the Landlord in respect of the
monies owing under paragraph 1 of this order:

The Tenant shall also pay the Landlord the rent for the months of
February 2022 up to and including October
2022 in full,
on or before the first day
of each corresponding month.
 
3.     If the Tenant
fails to make any of the payments
in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates required, then:
 
(a)  
The Landlord may apply under section
78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for
an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, and for the payment
of any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not already ordered under paragraph
1 of this order. The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a
breach of a condition set out in paragraph 2 of this order.




 
(b)  
The balance owing under paragraph 1 of this order shall become payable
on the day following
the date of default. The monies owing

at the post- judgment interest rate determined under subsection 207(7)
