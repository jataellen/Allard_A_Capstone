In the
  matter of:


BASEMENT, 193 TAYSHAM CRESCENT ETOBICOKE ON M9V1X6


 




Between:


Balbir Saini


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Sabir Aminzada


Tenant



 
 
 
Balbir Saini (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sabir Aminzada (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or a person the Tenant permitted in the residential
complex has seriously impaired the safety of any person.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 956 0593 7653# on January
20, 2022. Only the
Landlord attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord served an N7 notice to terminate the tenancy for seriously impaired
safety. The allegations are that the
Tenant took the lease to review it and the refused to provide the lease back or
provide any identification. The
Landlord also alleges called the Landlord about a missing USB and called the
Landlord a stalker. Finally, the
Landlord alleges the Tenant confronted her son-in-law and was threatening and
aggressive.
 
2.    
The Landlord testified that she and her family
do not feel safe due to the Tenant’s
behaviour and are uncomfortable in his presence.
 
3.     An order, based
on an N7 notice, must find that the impairment of safety must be a serious impairment. The consequences are such that it is short
notice, there is no opportunity to remedy
the problem, and the Sheriff
is to give priority to the eviction.
 
4.     I find the allegations in the notice
served on the Tenant do not demonstrate that there has been a serious impairment of safety. Therefore, the tenancy will not be
terminated base on the N7 notice the Landlord served on the Tenant.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
