In the matter
of:


2A, 98 SANFORD AVENUE
N HAMILTON ON L8L5Z2


 




Between:


Nirmal Heeralal


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Rainer Helmut Wolfarth


Tenant



 
 
Nirmal Heeralal (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Rainer Helmut Wolfarth
(the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the
unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 20, 2021 at 10:32am.
 
Only the Landlord attended
the hearing. The Landlord was represented by Kimberly Holleran.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
By way of background, this is a monthly tenancy
in which the rent is due
on the first of the month. The rental unit is
situated in a house on the main floor. As
of the hearing date, the
Tenant is in possession of the rental unit.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s L2 application based on the N12 notice
of termination was served to the
Tenant on August 26, 2021 with a termination date of October 31, 2021 pursuant
to subsection 48(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006.
 
3.    
At the hearing,
the Landlord’s evidence was, the
compensation required to be paid to the
Tenant pursuant to 48.1 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') was paid by waiving the rent for September 2021 – which the Tenant was informed
of prior to the termination date. The Landlord explains
that he had been communicating with the Tenant in this regard since June 2021. As
such, I find the Landlord has satisfied the requirement under sections 48.1 and
55.1 of the Act.
 
4.     The Landlord filed a declaration declaring that he, in
good faith, required possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation, satisfying the requirement found under subsection 72(1)(a) of the Act.




 
5.    
The Landlord’s uncontested evidence
was that he was presently living
on the first floor of the residential complex since 2018m but
is going through a divorce and requires more space for his son and him to move
to. He testified that all three tenants on the second floor have been aware of
this since January 2021. The Landlord
testified that he anticipates this home (the rental unit) to be his forever
home and has no intention to move elsewhere.
 
6.     The Landlord explains that since the N12 was served to
the Tenant, the Landlord received an order from the city to return the property to a single-family residence – although
not the subject of this application.
 
7.    
The Landlord
seeks a termination of the tenancy. ANALYSIS
8.     In Feeney v. Noble, 1994 CanLII
10538 (ON SC), [1994]
O.J. No 2049, 19 O.R. (3d) 762
(Ont.Div.Ct.) the Court held that
the test of good faith is genuine intention to occupy the premises and not the
reasonableness of the Landlord’s proposal. This
principle was upheld by the Courts in Salter
v. Beljinac 2001 CanLII 40231 (ON SCDC),
[2001] O.J. No. 2792, 201 D.L.R. (4th) 744 (Ont.Div.Ct.). In Salter v.
Beljinac, the Court held that the “good faith” requirement simply means
that the Landlord sincerely intends to occupy the rental unit. The Landlord
may also have additional motives
for selecting a particular rental unit, but this does not affect the
good faith of the Landlord’s notice.”
 
9.     In the more recent case of Fava v. Harrison,
[2014] O.J No. 2678 ONSC 3352 (Ont.Div.Ct.) the Court determined that while the
motives of the Landlord are, per Salter, “largely irrelevant”, the Board
can consider the conduct and motives of the Landlord to draw inferences as to whether the Landlord desires,
in good faith to occupy the property.”
 
10.  Based on the Landlord’s uncontested evidence, I find that the Landlord
in good faith requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation for himself and his son.
 
11.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Landlord is unaware of any
circumstances that would justify relief from eviction
 
12.  This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
October 31, 2021. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 12, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$875.67 (less any amount paid by the Tenants to the Landlord after the application was
filed with the Board), which represents




 
compensation for the use of the unit from November 1, 2021 to February 1, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $14.79
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from February 2, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
February 12, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 13, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 12, 2022, then starting February
13, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 13, 2022.
