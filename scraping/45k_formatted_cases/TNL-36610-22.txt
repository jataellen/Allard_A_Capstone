of:


1407, 2405
FINCH AVENUE WEST TORONTO ON M9M2X2


 




Between:


Medallion Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Bukonla Adesanya
  Sikiru Adesanya


Tenants



 
 
 
Medallion Corporation (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sikiru
Adesanya and Bukonla Adesanya (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants
pay the rent and compensation for damage they owe because the Tenants failed to
meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on December 20, 2021
with respect to application TNL- 32480-21.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I
find that the Tenants have not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The
Tenants failed to pay the lawful monthly rent and the arrears installment on or
before January 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or
all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears
of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $7,067.15 for rent
arrears, compensation for damage and the costs related to the Landlord's
application fee in Order TNL-32480-21. The amount that is still owing from that order
is $7,067.15 and that amount
is included in this
order. As a result, the previous order TNL-32480-21 is cancelled.




 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenants
have failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.
 
6.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,615.80
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from September 1, 2020 to February 15, 2022.
 
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TNL-32480-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 26, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $7,067.55* (less
any amount paid to the Landlords after this application was filed on January
26, 2022). This amount represents the rent owing, unpaid compensation for
damage and the costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord
owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$53.19 per day for compensation for the use of the
unit starting February 16, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
26, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 27, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 26, 2022, then starting
February 27, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 27, 2022.

The tenant has until February
25, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order
under s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by February 25, 2022
the order will be stayed and the Board will schedule a hearing.
