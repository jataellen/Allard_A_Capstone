In the matter
of:


805 MCKAY
CRESCENT MILTON ON L9T6L2


 




Between:


Seema Siddiqi


Old
Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Alexandria Brown Dane Brown Monica Ferguson Renesha Campbell


Tenants



 
 
Seema Siddiqi (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dane Brown, Renesha
Campbell, Monica Ferguson
and Alexandria Brown
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 610 000 379# on November
6, 2020 and concluded on
January 28, 2022.
 
Seema Siddiqu (SS), the old landlord and the Tenant, Monica
Ferguson attended the hearing
on November 6, 2021. Only SS attend the hearing on January 28, 2022.
 
On November 6, 2021 interim order
SOL-13155-20-IN was issued
requiring SS to
amend the L1 application to add
the name of the new landlord as an interested party. SS was also ordered to give a copy of the application, and the Notice of Hearing
issued by the LTB, to the
new Landlord before the hearing on January 28, 2022.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     Seema Siddique (SS) did not amend the application or serve the new landlord a copy
of the application along with the Notice of the Hearing
as ordered under interim order SOL-
13155-20-IN issued on November 6, 2021. No
explanation was given as to reasons for non-compliance.
 
2.     SS reconfirmed the rental unit transferred ownership
to the new landlord on April 28,2020. Even though
the application was filed on February
16, 2020 while
SS still had ownership, her request for an order
for non-payment of rent is denied because of the following:




File Number: SOL-13155-20
 
3.    
The definition of landlord
under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') doesn’t include a former
landlord.
 
4.     SS no longer has a right to claim the arrears because
of section 18 of the Act which states,
“covenants concerning things
related to a rental unit or the residential complex
in which it is located runs with the land, whether or not the things are
in existence at the time the covenants were made”.
 
5.     The right to claim arrears runs with the land and to
the new landlord when the property changed hands. Since SS failed to amend and
inform the new landlord, the Board was not prepared to accept the arrears owing up to April 28, 2021
was part of the statement
of adjustments for their purchase and sale agreement.
 
6.     The new landlord
is the only entity that can pursue
the rent and he wasn’t present
to make submissions on the issue.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The application is dismissed.
