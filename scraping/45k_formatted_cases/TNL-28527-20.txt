Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number:
TNL-28527-20




 
In the matter
  of:


 
301, 980 LAWRENCE AVENUE
E TORONTO ON M3C1R2


 




Between:


Niot Investment Holdings Limited


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


John Verette


Tenant



 
 
 
Niot Investment Holdings Limited
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict John Verette (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental
unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on October 14, 2021 commencing at 9 am.
 
Only the Landlord and their legal representative attended
the hearing although
all parties were properly served with notice of this
hearing by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Landlord served the Tenant with an N5 Notice of Termination alleging
that they have substantially interfered with the
Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, interest or privilege because
they failed to pay their hydro bill as required by the tenancy agreement.
 
2.       
I
accept the Landlord’s uncontested evidence of that the tenancy agreement
requires the Tenant to pay for
hydro service to the unit. It also
requires the Tenant to have Toronto Hydro put invoices in his name.
 
3.       
I
accept the Landlord’s uncontested evidence that despite numerous
good faith attempts by the Landlord to have the
Tenant take responsibility for and pay their hydro bills, the Tenant has simply
ignored the landlord, without explanation.
 
4.       
Given that the Tenant has failed to pay the bills as required by the tenancy agreement, I am satisfied that the Tenant’s conduct has substantially
interfered with the Landlord's




 
reasonable enjoyment and his lawful right to have the hydro bill paid by the Tenant
under the tenancy agreement.
 
5.       
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,560.59 from the Tenant and
this deposit is still being held by
the Landlord.
 
6.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenant for the period from September 1, 2018
to January 31, 2022.
 
Section 83
 
7.       
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenant did not attend
the hearing and thus the Board did not receive evidence in support of
relieve from eviction. The Landlord has made numerous attempts to have the
Tenant comply with their obligations under the tenancy agreement, but the
Tenant has not been responsive.
 
8.       
The Landlord
is unaware of any circumstances that would justify
refusing or delaying eviction.
It is ordered
that:
 
1.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of January
24, 2022. The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before January 31, 2022.
 
2.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022
then starting February 1, 2022 the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 1, 2022.
 
 
 
January 10, 2022
Date Issued                                                                      John Tzanis

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on June 4, 2022 if the order has not been
filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that
has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
