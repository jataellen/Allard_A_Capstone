Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55519-21



In the matter of:


17, 109 BRIEN
AVENUE EAST ESSEX ON N8M2N9


 




Between:


Windsor Essex Community Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


and


 




 


 
Annette Rivait


 
Tenant



 
 
Windsor Essex Community Housing
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Annette Rivait (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 20, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal
Representative, Cameron Parrott,
attended the hearing.
As of 12:04 p.m. the Tenant
was not present or represented at the hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from December 1, 2020 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective June 7, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $518.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant paid $2,272.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.     The Tenant has been paying $50.00 per month towards
their arrears. At the hearing, the Landlord’s
Legal Representative requested
a payment plan order reflecting a continuation of the
payments towards the arrears at $50.00 per month.
 
7.     The amount outstanding to January 31, 2022, inclusive of rent arrears
($1,233.00) and costs
($186.00), is $1,419.00.
 
8.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to




 
grant relief from eviction, as requested by the Landlord,
subject to the conditions set out
in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$1,419.00, which represents the arrears of rent
($1,233.00) and costs ($186.00) outstanding for the period ending January 31,
2022.
 
2.     The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant is denied
on the condition that:
 
(a) 
The Tenant shall make the following
payments to the Landlord in respect of the
monies owing under paragraph 1 of this order:
