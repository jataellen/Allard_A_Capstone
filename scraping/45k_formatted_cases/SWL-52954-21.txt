Tenant



 
 
 
Choo Kee
Munikar (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Jacqueline Oxley (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes.
 
The Landlord
also applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant has
been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent.
 
The Landlord
also applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for
the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard via videoconference
on January 24, 2022. Only the Landlord attended the hearing. As of 1:45 p.m.,
the Tenant was not present or represented although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
L2
Application:
 
1.    At the hearing,
the Landlord testified
the Tenant vacated
the unit on September 7,
2021.
 
2.   
As the Tenant has vacated the unit, there is no need to consider the merits of the Landlord’s application to evict the
Tenant. The Landlord’s application is moot.
 
3.    As such, this portion of the Landlord’s application is dismissed.
 
L1
Application:
4.   
The Tenant has not paid the total
rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from February 1, 2021 to March 31, 2021. Because
