Robert Bonspiel


Tenant



 
 
 
Bristol Road Local 183 Non-Profit
Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Robert Bonspiel (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on March 22, 2021 and December 2, 2021. The Landlord's Legal Representative, Cathy
Corsetti, and the Landlord’s Agent,
Kathy Andreopoulos, attended
the hearing. The Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing.
 
The Tenant did not attend the
hearing on March 22, 2021. After the
hearing, the Tenant advised the Board that a dental
emergency had prevented
him from attending. Additionally, it came to my attention that the Tenant had
requested an Accommodation that had not been processed by the Board. The matter was adjourned to allow the
Tenant the opportunity to attend.
 
As a result of the Tenant’s
Accommodation request, the Tenant was granted the use of a Public Access Terminal for the December 2,
2021 hearing, because he did not have access to the internet. The Tenant was served with a Notice
of Hearing by mail and was in contact with Board
staff about the hearing by telephone in the weeks before the hearing.
 
The hearing was scheduled
to begin at 10:00 a.m. As the Tenant was not present
or represented at the
hearing, I stood the matter down to allow the Tenant additional time to arrive. At 11:15 a.m., I contacted Board staff and
was informed that the Tenant had not arrived at the location of the Public
Access Terminal and that there had been no communication from the Tenant on the
day of the hearing.
 
The matter proceeded unopposed.




 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
23, 2020.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $626.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.    
The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
6.    
I have considered
all of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find
that the Landlord did attempt to negotiate repayment of the arrears of rent. In
making this finding I considered the Landlord’s Legal Representative’s
submissions that the Landlord reached out to the Tenant in writing and the
Tenant refused to pay. As the Tenant did not attend and no other circumstances
were presented to me at the hearing, I find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 1, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$12,438.90*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to
February 18, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $20.58
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 19, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before March 1, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 2, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.




 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 1, 2022, then starting March 2, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 2, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$12,862.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022,
or
ii)             
$13,488.00 if the payment
is made on or before
March 1, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under
that subsection on or after March
2, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
