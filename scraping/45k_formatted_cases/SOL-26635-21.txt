Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26635-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


2, 73 CENTURY STREET HAMILTON ON L8L1V9


 




Between:


Frank Daddurno


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Tammy Sheridan


Tenant



 
 
 
Frank Daddurno
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Tammy Sheridan (the 'Tenant') and for an
order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on December 8, 2020
with respect to application SOL-14210-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
In the Landlords application it shows that there was a large payment made towards
arrears and rent on June 21, 2021.
 
2.    
As no other arrear
payments are shown
after that date and as the Landlord
has indicated on the
application that arrears are paid in full, it must be assumed that the arrears
were paid in full on June 21, 2021.
 
3.    
The Landlord
goes on to request that the eviction
proceed based on missed rental payments after that date i.e.
September onwards.
 
4.    
The ability
to evict a tenant expires
once all the arrears
have been paid in full.
 
5.    
In this case this was
not supposed to happen until January 2023 and in that case all subsequent
monthly rental payments would have to made in full and on time because there
were still rental arrears outstanding. In this case the Tenant accelerated the
payments and got the arrears
paid off well before that date and therefore, by law, there can be no eviction where there is no
arrears except in the case of a persistent late application of which this is
not one.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord's application under section
78 of the Act is dismissed.
