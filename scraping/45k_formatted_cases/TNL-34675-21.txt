Order under Section

Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-34675-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


0101, 4750 BATHURST STREET TORONTO ON M2R1W9


 




Between:


Danbar Property Holdings Ii Lp


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Catherine Mcneil


Tenant



 
 
 
Danbar Property Holdings Ii Lp (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Catherine Mcneil (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 13, 2021.
Only the Landlord’s Legal
Representative, Sharon Harris,
attended the hearing.
As of 1:42 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from August 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective August 25, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly rent is
$940.05.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant paid $1,864.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered
that:

Unless the Tenant

2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the
Landlord $3,699.69*, which

4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord

2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.

of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 8, 2022.

the Tenant wishes
to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:

$3,962.30 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$4,902.35 if the payment
is made on or before
February 7, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of
the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 8, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
