In the matter
of:


8249 MUNDARE CRESCENT NIAGARA FALLS ON L2G7M6


 




Between:


Rahim Lila


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jacklyn Miller Joseph Steele


Tenants



 
 
 
Rahim Lila (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Jacklyn Miller and Joseph Steele
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on December 20, 2021.
The Landlord and the Tenants attended the hearing. The Tenant, Jacklyn Miller
(JM), had an opportunity to speak with Tenant Duty Counsel before the hearing
began.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from May 1,
2021 to December 31, 2021. Because of
the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective June 25,
2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,790.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,790.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period
from May 31, 2020 to June 25, 2021.
 
5.    
The Tenants
paid $2,600.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.    
At the hearing the Tenants raised
the following maintenance issues pursuant to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'):
 
•        
Exterior Drain/Catch Basin Flooding
•        
Bathtub




 
•        
Front Door
•        
Animals in the Chimney
 
Exterior Drain/Catch Basin
Flooding
 
7.    
The Tenants
submitted that the driveway floods
when it rains. JM testified
that the driveway is on a slope
and when it rains, water
pools into the catch basin.
The catch basin overflows,
resulting in her driveway flooding.
This occurred on May 29, 2020, August
15, 2020, June 13, 2021, July 6, 2021
and July 8, 2021. The Tenants submitted that the Landlord’s response to the
flooding has been inadequate. Specifically, on August 15, 2020 the Landlord had
Roto Rooter attend the unit to snake the drain. On this date, the employee
recommended to the Tenant that they break through the concrete to access the
roots to prevent further damage. She submitted this was told to her and to the
Landlord verbally. After, three more floods occurred. On July 8, 2021, the
flood was such that the Tenants had to bail out water from the garage.
 
8.    
The Landlord
submitted that he was responsive to the flooding
issues at the Tenants’ unit. The Landlord testified that the May
29, 2020 flood was reported to him on June 2, 2022. This was not a flood, but the catch basin was draining very slowly. Enercare
was contacted to address the
draining. They attended two weeks later but they said they could not drain it. The maintenance person
attended June 23, 2020 and the Tenant
confirmed on June 28,
2020 there were no further issues.
 
9.    
Regarding the August
15, 2020 incident, the Landlord made an emergency call to Roto Rooters and they
came within hours. They identified and cut out roots and the blockage was
cleared. The conversation had with the Roto Rooter employee was that the
Landlord should schedule a clearing of the pipes every year. As such, the
Landlord booked an appointment one year into the future.
 
10.  On June 12, 2021, the Tenants reported the
drain was slow to drain. The Landlord contacted Roto Rooter, who scheduled the Landlord for their next available appointment of July 12, 2021.
 
11.  Prior to July 6, 2021, the City of Niagara
ripped up the sidewalks so any water coming in would affect the draining. On July 6, 2021, the Tenants reported
to the Landlord that water was slow to clear. On July 8, 2021,
the Tenants reported heavy flooding. The Landlord contacted Roto Rooter, who said they were unavailable and could not attend that day.
The Landlord told the Tenants to purchase a submersible pump and sandbags, for
which he reimbursed them. On July 12, 2021, Roto Rooter attended, and they did
a full review, cleaned the drain
lines and diverted
water. Since that point, the Tenants have not reported further issues. The Landlord
submitted into evidence the receipts for each Roto Rooter attendance.
 
Analysis




 
12.  In the case Onyskiw v. CJM Property
Management, 2016 ONCA 477 (Onyskiw) (CanLII), the Court of Appeal for Ontario determined that a contextual
approach should be adopted when considering a landlord’s potential
breach of subsection 20(1) of the Act and a breach will not be found if the
landlord’s response to a maintenance issue was reasonable in the circumstances. Therefore, simply because there
had been flooding
at the rental unit, does not automatically amount to a breach
of subsection 20(1) of the Act by the Landlord.
 
13.  The evidence before
the Board was that the Landlord had a timely
response to the Tenants’
complaints of each flood. While the Tenants may dispute the Landlord’s response
was timely between the June 12, 2021 and July 8, 2021 flood, the credible and
believable evidence of the Landlord was that Roto Rooter was contacted immediately but no one was
unavailable for treatment until July 12, 2021.
 
14.  Further,
while the Tenants
dispute the adequacy
of the Landlord’s response because
they did not break through the concrete to access the roots as recommended by Roto Rooter,
I am not persuaded
this would have prevented further
floods. As the Tenants are raising this issue pursuant to section 82 of the Act, the Tenants bear
the burden of proving the merits of their claim on a balance of
probabilities (i.e., at least 51% of
the way). The Tenants did not prove, by calling the employee from Roto Rooter to testify at the hearing,
for example, that this was required
to prevent any further flooding. Further, it was uncontested that there
have been no further floods reported since July 12, 2021.
 
15.  On the evidence before me, I find that the
Landlord’s responses to address the flooding were reasonable in these circumstances. Consequently, in accordance with Onyskiw, I am
not satisfied that the Landlord breached subsection 20(1) of the Act by failing
to maintain the rental unit with respect
to the flooding as the Landlord acted reasonably and responded
when advised that there was a problem.
 
Bathtub
 
16.  The Tenants submitted
that there was water dripping
from the bathtub
to the furnace room onto the water heater.
JM testified that on July 8, 2020,
she heard dripping
into the furnace room while she was in the
basement. She reported this to the Landlord on July 9, 2020. Submitted into evidence were two photos dated July 9, 2020, showing water on
top of the water heater. The Landlord recommended that the Tenants
caulk around the bathtub. She did as such on July 10, 2020. There
was further dripping on September 4 and 21, 2020. The Landlord was advised of
the issues. The maintenance person attended and said he could not locate the
issue. On August 3, 2021, during a routine maintenance inspection, JM reported
the issue again to the
maintenance person, for which
he said he did not
think it was an issue. JM testified this is an ongoing issue and the
Tenants have been hesitant to use the bathtub for fear of further leaks.
 
17.  The Landlord acknowledged the Tenants
reported the leaking issue on June 9, 2020 but assumed the issue was resolved after
they caulked the tub. When the maintenance person attended the unit for the inspection, he did not witness
any leaking and therefore, did not repair a leak. The Landlord submitted that
if there was a leak, the Tenant should contact the Landlord’s maintenance person immediately so he can observe the leak and know how to fix it.




 
 
 
Analysis
 
18.  On a balance of probabilities, I find the
Landlord was in breach of his maintenance obligations. JM’s credible and
believable evidence was that there is dripping from the tub into the furnace
room and onto the water
heater. JM reported the issue of the leak
on four occasions. The
Landlord’s response was for the Tenant to caulk the tub and thereafter, denied
the existence of any issues. While the
Landlord submitted the Tenant
should have contacted the maintenance person immediately so he could witness the leak, the Landlord
should undertake to investigate potential causes of the leak rather than
dismiss its existence entirely.
 
19.  Having found the Landlord is in breach of
his obligations, the Tenants are entitled to a remedy. JM requested that the Landlord
repair the leak. I find this remedy
to be reasonable in the circumstances.
 
Front Door
 
20.  The Tenants submitted that the front door
has had issues with sticking and latching. JM testified that on July 5, 2020,
she first noticed she could not use the front door because it was stuck. She
reported it to the Landlord and a
contractor came on September 26, 2020 to remove the edging around the
door, relevel the door and put back the edging. On December 4, 2020, the
Tenants contacted the Landlord regarding further issues with the door, and
requested a door installer to attend, but instead the Landlord’s maintenance
person came. On February 4, 2021, the door was stuck again,
and the doorknob broke off. On March 15, 2021, the maintenance
person attended and replaced the doorknob. On June 11, 2021, the Tenants
reported the door sticking. On August 9, 2021, someone attended the unit to
repair it.
 
21.  The issue to date is that the door no longer
sticks but cannot latch. The
door swings open if it is not locked
shut. JM stated that she informed the maintenance person of the front door not
latching in December 2021. However, as of the date of the hearing, the
maintenance person had yet to look at the issue.
The Tenants are worried that the door will
begin sticking again with the winter months because they believe the weight of
the snow weighs down the roof, causing the door to stick shut.
 
22.  The Landlord submitted that he responded to
all issues regarding the door. When the Tenant first reported the sticky door,
the Landlord contacted the door contractor immediately. However, they could not attend
until September 2020 because of COVID-19.
Thereafter, the Landlord submitted his response was timely. After June 11,
2021, he did not hear about any issues
about the door and was first informed
of the latching issue at the
hearing.
 
Analysis
 
23. 
On a balance of probabilities, I find the Landlord was not in breach of his
maintenance obligations pursuant to section
20(1) of the Act. Although there is no
dispute that the door




 
sticking was a disrepair issue, as per Onyskiw, I find that
the Landlords’ response upon being notified of the sticky
door to be reasonable. After each time the Tenants
reported the sticking door,
the Landlord either contacted the contractor to attend or sent the maintenance
person immediately. I find that the
delay in the door contractor attending the unit was not unreasonable. It is
undisputed that the door sticking is presently not an issue and the Tenants’
concern regarding the door sticking in the future is speculative, only.
 
24.  Regarding
the latching issue,
Section 30(2) of the Act requires me to consider
whether the Tenant had advised the Landlords of the issue
before applying to the Board.
The evidence before me was
that Tenants did not make the Landlord’s agent aware of the issue until
December 2021, after they filed
their list of section 82 issues. It would be unreasonable to suggest that the Landlord
should be found as being
in breach of a maintenance obligation when they were not aware that a maintenance issue
existed until a few weeks before this hearing.
 
Animals in the
Chimney
 
25.  The Tenants submitted that there were animals in their chimney
beginning March 2, 2021.
Pest control was contacted by the Landlord the same day. JM testified that pest
control recommended that the chimney be capped off, which the Tenants relayed
to the Landlord. To date, the chimney is not capped off. The Tenants
did not make any submissions regarding ongoing issues with animals in the
chimney.
 
26.  The Landlord submitted that pest control
attended as soon as he was notified. The Landlord disputed he was told that the chimney should
be capped off. The Tenants
did not comment on this issue since March 9, 2021 when JM informed
him that she no longer heard animals. A roofing inspector came to the unit on July 13, 2021, and no recommendations were made to cap off
the chimney.
 
Analysis
 
27.  On a balance of probabilities, I do not
find that the Landlord was in breach of his maintenance obligations. While the
Tenants dispute the adequacy of the Landlord’s response because he did not cap off the chimney, I am not persuaded this is a maintenance
issue. As the Tenants are raising
this issue pursuant to section 82 of
the Act, the Tenants bear the burden of proving the merits of their claim. The
Tenants did not prove, by calling a person from pest control to testify, for
example, that this is required to prevent animals. Further, it was uncontested
that there have been no animals in the chimney since March 2, 2021.
 
 
Relief from Eviction
 
28.  I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), including the impact of COVID-19 on the
parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the




 
Tenants and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until January 31, 2022 pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
29.  Pursuant to section 83(6), I am required to
consider whether the Landlord made attempts to
negotiate a payment
agreement with the Tenants. The Landlord testified
that numerous payment plans were presented until July 25, 2021. However,
the parties did not reach an agreement. I am satisfied that the Landlord
attempted to negotiate a payment agreement with the Tenants.
 
30.  With respect to section 83(2), JM testified
that her and Joseph Steele’s employment has suffered due to COVID-19 and they
have been relying on government assistance. If the tenancy was terminated, this
would leave the Tenants and three kids homeless. They are currently quarantining because
of COVID in their family.
She presented a payment plan of
paying $300.00 a month in additional to the lawful
monthly rent until
the arrears are paid in full.
 
31.  The Landlord submitted it would be
prejudicial to continue the tenancy. The property is owned by the Landlord’s
senior parents who rely on the income from the unit as part of their
retirement. The Landlord’s parents have minimal available credit against their
line of credit due the arrears. He further objected to the Tenants’ proposed
payment plan.
 
32.  I find it unfair to impose the Tenants’
proposed payment plan on the Landlord as it would take 34 months to pay off the
outstanding arrears. While I find the Landlord’s parents’ circumstances to be worrying, in consideration of the Tenants’
children and difficulties with COVID-19, I find it appropriate to postpone eviction. This
postponed termination will give the Tenants an opportunity to organize their
move.
 
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the
Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before January 31, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $8,496.21*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 5, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay
to the Landlord $58.85 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 6, 2022 to the date the
Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 31, 2022, the
Tenant will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from February 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.




 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022, then starting February
1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
February 1, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 31, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $11,906.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be
terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after
February 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
 
Regarding the Tenants’ Section
82 issues
 
10. 
On or before January
