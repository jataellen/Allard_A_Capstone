Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12135-21
 
 
In the matter of:      102 OLD HARWOOD
AVENUE
AJAX ON L1T0P4
 




Between:                  Girija Pusuluri Ratan Pusuluri


Landlords




 
 
and
 




Mark Anthony Bernard
Yolande Martina
Phinn-Bernard


Tenants




 
 
 
Girija Pusuluri and Ratan
Pusuluri (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Yolande Martina Phinn-Bernard and Mark Anthony
Bernard (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord
requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation. The Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 21, 2022.
 
The Landlords’ Legal Representative, Harpreet
Luthra, and the Tenant, Yolande
Martina Phinn- Bernard, on her own behalf and on behalf of
the other tenant, attended the hearing. The Tenant spoke with Duty Counsel prior to the start of the
proceeding.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
On September 12, 2021, the
Landlords served an N12 Notice of Termination on the Tenants. The N12 Notice
provides the Landlord
intends to move into the rental unit and
occupy it for at least one year. The date of termination is November 30, 2021.
 
Affidavit and disclosure of prior N12 and N13 notices:
 
2.       
Section 71.1 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”), which came into force on
September 1, 2021, requires the Landlord to file an affidavit or declaration
from the person(s) who personally intends to occupy the rental unit and to
provide certain information about all N12 and N13 notices served in the
previous two years with the Landlord’s application. If this is not done, the
Act provides the Board must refuse to accept the application.




File Number: HOL-12135-21
 
3.       
By endorsement dated December 2,
2021, the Landlord was ordered to file the affidavit or declaration from the person(s) who personally intends
to occupy the rental unit and to provide information about previous N12
and N13 notices by December 9, 2021.
 
4.       
The Board’s records indicate
the Landlord complied
with the endorsement by submitting the
required materials on December 6, 2021. Further, the Board’s records show that
when the Tenant was served with the Landlord’s application, the application
package, declaration, and evidence was included.
 
5.       
As a result, I find the Landlord has complied with their obligations under section 71.1.
 
Agreement between
the parties
 
6.       
The Tenants agree the Landlords paid them compensation equal to one month's rent.
 
7.       
The parties also agreed
the Tenants vacated
the rental unit on November
30, 2021.
 
8.       
The parties further agreed
the Landlords collected
a rent deposit of $2,150.00 from the Tenants and
this deposit was applied to the month of November 2021.
 
9.       
Finally, the parties agreed
the Landlords would
calculate any interest
owing to the Tenants on the deposit and e-transfer this amount to the Tenants
within 10 days.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated, as of November
30, 2021, the date the Tenants gave vacant possession of the rental unit
to the Landlords.
