Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19673-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


114, 450B SCARBOROUGH GOLF CLUB ROAD SCARBOROUGH ON M1G3V7


 




Between:


Masaryktown Non-Profit Residences Inc.


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Hana Havlikova


Tenant



 
 
 
Masaryktown
Non-Profit Residences Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Hana Havlikova (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the
Tenant's rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on January 11, 2022.
 
Only Corina
Stavre, on behalf of the Landlord, and the Landlord's Legal Representative, Leo
Corsetti, attended the hearing.
As of 10:53 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
Based on the particulars contained in the N8 Notice
of Eviction served
to the Tenant on September 22, 2021, I
find that from July 2020 to September 22, 2021, the Tenant
was late paying the rent 15 months out of the 15-month period.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s Legal Representative submitted that even though the Tenant did not pay October rent and was late
November, December and January, the
Landlord is seeking a conditional pay-on-time order for a period of one-year starting
February 1, 2022 plus the application filing fee.
 
3.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from
eviction subject to the condition(s)
set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
The Landlord’s request is very reasonable.
 
4.    
This order contains all the reasons
for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.




File Number: TEL-19673-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.    
The Tenant shall pay the lawful
rent to the Landlord in full and on time for the period
February 1, 2022 through January 1, 2023.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing from paragraph 2 on or before February
1 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest calculated from February 2, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.    
If the Tenant fails to
make any payments in accordance with paragraph 1, the Landlord may apply under section
78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’) for an order
terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a breach of a condition set out
in paragraph 1 of this order.
