File Number: SOL-24078-21-SA
 
 



In the matter
of:


3 MEADOW
WOOD CRESCENT STONEY CREEK
  ON L8J3Z7


 




Between:


Shafika Munshi


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Amanda Bond Carlysle Rudder


Tenants



 
Shafika Munshi (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Amanda Bond and Carlysle Rudder (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants gave a notice to terminate the tenancy. That
application was resolved by order SOL-24078-21 issued on August 31, 2021.
 
The Tenants filed a motion to set aside order SOL-24078-21.
 
This motion was scheduled
by videoconference on January 14, 2022 at 1:00pm.
 
Only the first-named Tenant
attended the hearing
when the matter
was called at 1:29pm.
 
I note the Landlord’s represented
joined the videoconference line at approximately 3:25pm advising that neither
he nor his client to connect to the videoconference link. I advised that the
hearing had already concluded and suggested that, in the future, the phone could also be used to connect to the videoconference
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord’s L3 application was filed pursuant
to subsection 77(1) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') with a termination date of September 1,
2021. This section states:
 
77 (1) A landlord
may, without notice to the tenant, apply to
the Board for an order terminating a tenancy and evicting
the tenant if,
 
(a)              
the landlord
and tenant have entered into an agreement to terminate the
tenancy; or
(b)              
the tenant has given the landlord
notice of termination of the tenancy.
 
2.    
At some point during
the Tenant’s evidence, it came to the Board’s
attention that the N9
notice of termination, which the Tenant admits to giving the Landlord was not
in




 
compliance
with the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006. Specifically, the termination date was
not at the end of the term; and it was only signed by one of the two Tenants on the
tenancy agreement.
 
3.     At the hearing, the Tenant submitted a copy of the
tenancy agreement dated August 24, 2019 which lists the Tenants
as Amanda Bond and Carlysle
Rudder. The Tenant
testified that at the time the notice was given to the Landlord,
Carlysle Rudder was living at the rental unit and still had possession of the
rental unit.
 
4.     Section 43(1) of the Act states:
 
(a)  (1) Where this Act permits
a landlord or tenant to give a notice of termination, the notice shall be in a form approved by
the Board and shall,
 
(a)              
identify the rental unit for which the notice
is given;
 
(b)              
state the date on which the tenancy is to terminate; and
 
(c)              
be signed by the person
giving the notice,
or the person’s agent.
 
[Emphasis added.]
 
5.    
Thus, the notice of termination that was filed with the L3 application was defective as it was not signed
by all the parties to the tenancy
agreement (meaning, the other party to
the tenancy agreement).
 
6.    
The lease agreement also indicated the term of the lease as three years, commencing October 1, 2019; this means that the lease was for
a fixed term ending
September 30, 2022.
 
7.     The Tenants gave notice to the Landlord
pursuant to section 47 of the Act which
states:
 
A tenant may terminate
a tenancy at the end of a period
of the tenancy or at the end of the term of a tenancy for a fixed
term by giving notice of termination to the landlord in accordance with section
44.
 
8.     Section 44(4) of the Act states:
 
(4) A notice under section 47, 58 or 144 to terminate a tenancy for a fixed term
shall be given at least 60 days before the expiration date specified in
the tenancy agreement, to be effective on that expiration date.
 
[Emphasis added.]
 
9.     Thus, the N9 notice of termination is defective
because it does not provide sufficient number of days to be a valid notice of
termination. Specifically, it was not dated for the end of the term. There was no evidence
before the Board that the Landlord accepted
the Tenant’s offer to terminate the tenancy before the end of the lease.




 
10.  In light of the above,
the Tenant’s motion
to set aside the order
is granted and the
Landlord’s application is dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants’ motion
to set aside order SOL-24078-21 issued on August
31, 2021 is granted.
 
2.     The application is amended to reflect both names of the Tenants.
 
3.     The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
