In the matter

C6, 6200 DORCHESTER ROAD NORTH NIAGARA
  FALLS ON L2G5T2


 




Between:

and


 




 


Ivonne De La Rosa


Tenant



 
 
 
Jeffrey Lanys
and Lanys Properties Inc. (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Ivonne De La Rosa (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have
the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a
condition specified in the order issued by the Board on June 29, 2021 with
respect to application SOL-17751-20.
 
The Landlords'
application was resolved by order SOL-24715-21, issued on June 29, 2021. The
Tenant filed a motion to set aside order SOL-24715-21.
 
This motion
was heard by video conference on January 12, 2022. The Landlord, Jeffrey Lanys
and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
Order SOL-17751-20, issued on the
consent of the parties, provided that the Landlords could apply to the Board under
section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without
notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the
Tenant did not meet certain conditions specified in the order.
 
2.     The Landlords filed the application under section 78
of the Act, alleging that the Tenant failed to pay the monthly rent on September 1, 2021, and arrears of $500.00 on August
16 and September 1, 2021, contrary
to order SOL-17751-20. This resulted in the
issuance of ex parte order SOL-24715-21 terminating the tenancy.
 
3.    
In support of the motion to set aside the order, the
Tenant testified that she failed to make the payments because she did not
understand that she agreed to pay $500.00 twice a month. The Tenant has not
paid any more rent or arrears to the Landlords since the payment of October
2021 rent.




File Number: SOL-24715-21-SA
 
4.    
The Tenant, who moved into the
rental unit in September 2019 did not
offer a plan to pay the amount owing to the Landlords but instead requested an
additional month to find alternative accommodation. The Tenant asserted that
she has packed up all her belongings.
 
5.     Based on all the evidence, there is no dispute that
the Tenant breached the order to pay September rent on the first day of the
month and arrears of $500.00 on August 16 and September 1, 2021 respectively. In addition, even if, incredibly, the Tenant
was confused about the payment of the arrears, the Tenant failed to pay any
rent to the Landlords for the months of November and December 2021 in continued
breach of order SOL-17751- 20.
 
6.    
I
have considered all the disclosed
circumstances in accordance
with subsection 78(11)
(b) of the Act
and find that it would be unfair to grant the Tenant’s motion. Having failed to pay the rent and arrears for months, the Tenant owes the
Landlords more today than she did at the time the parties consented to the
terms of order SOL-17751-20.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The motion to set aside Order SOL-24715-21, issued on
June 29, 2021, is denied. The order is confirmed and remains unchanged.
 
2.     The stay of order SOL-24715-21 is lifted on January 31, 2022.
