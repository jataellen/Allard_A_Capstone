Review Order
 
Martha Bendzsel (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Michael Davidson and Amy Turner (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was resolved
by order SOL-19980-21 issued on October
26, 2021.
 
On November 3, 2021, the
Landlord requested a review of the order alleging they were not reasonably able to participate in the hearing held by the Board on October 5, 2021, because
of technical difficulties with being admitted to the video conference.
 
On November 9, 2021, the Board issued interim
order SOL-19980-21-RV-IN directing
the matter to a review hearing
for determination.
 
The Landlord’s request was heard
by way of video conference on January 25, 2022. The Landlord, the Landlord’s
Legal Representative, Edwin Alexander, and the Tenants attended the hearing. The Tenants spoke
to Tenant Duty Counsel prior to the commencement of the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Landlord’s Request to Review
 
1.       
The Landlord testified that she was with her Representative on the day of the hearing.
She arrived at his office prior to 9:00 am, the scheduled time for the hearing. Her Representative tried numerous times to
join the video conference line but was never admitted into the hearing room.




File Number: SOL-19980-21-RV
 
2.       
The Landlord’s Representative
submitted that in addition to trying to access the video conference by way of computer, he also tried to call into the hearing. He submitted
that he tried to call several times and received a message that the host would
let them in shortly. However, they
were never admitted into the hearing.
 
3.       
The Landlord’s Representative submitted that on the day of the hearing,
he emailed the Board to inquire why he was not
admitted into the hearing. A copy of the Landlord’s Representative’s email is
on file with the Board. The
Landlord’s Representative never received a response from the Board.
 
4.       
The Landlord’s Representative submitted
that he tried to gain access to the hearing
until 4:30 pm with no success.
 
5.       
The Tenants had no evidence with respect to the Landlords ability to participate in the hearing of
October 5, 2021.
 
6.       
Based on the uncontested evidence of the Landlord, and the uncontested submissions of the
Landlord’s Representative, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that
they were not reasonably able to
participate in the hearing.
 
7.       
The Landlord’s request to review is granted.
 
New Hearing of Landlord’s L1 Application
 
8.       
The Landlord sought the consent of the Board
to withdraw the application. I consented to the request.
 
9.       
The Landlord’s application having
been withdrawn; the Board’s file is closed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The Landlord’s request to review is granted.
 
2.       
The Landlord’s application is dismissed without
prejudice.
