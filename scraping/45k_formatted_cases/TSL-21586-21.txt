Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective April 19, 2021.
 
1.    
The Tenants
vacated the rental
unit on November 30, 2021. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
2.     The lawful monthly
rent was $2,485.00.
 
3.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $2,485.00 from the Tenants

is still being held by the Landlord.
 
4.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from August
3, 2020 to April 19, 2021.
 
5.     The Tenants paid $4,965.00 after
the application was filed.
