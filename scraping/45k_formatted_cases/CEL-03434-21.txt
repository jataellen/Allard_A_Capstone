Wyatt Diamond Harbour


Tenant



 
 
 
Canadian Mental Health
Association Gb (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Wyatt Diamond Harbour (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential
complex has wilfully caused undue damage to the premises; because the Tenant,
another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the
residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant; and
because the Tenant or another occupant of the rental unit has committed an
illegal act or has carried out, or permitted someone to carry out an illegal
trade, business or occupation in the rental unit or the residential complex. ; because
the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or
a person the Tenant permitted in the residential complex
has seriously impaired
the safety of any person. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on February
10, 2022. The Landlord’s
representatives, Kara Muzzell and Rebecca Carr, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord introduced evidence of three criminal
charges against the Tenant for threats of bodily harm against
others in the residential complex,
as well as breaches of conditions of his release.
 
2.     The Tenant throws
garbage from his unit onto the street
below. The garbage
contains used needles and drug paraphernalia that have been for drugs
use.
 
3.     Photographs supported by the testimony from Rebecca
Carr, show that the Tenant has caused extensive damage
to the rental unit. There is graffiti
covering many of the walls, damage to property throughout the
unit. The Tenant has intentionally
caused water damage to the rental unit and this damage has leaked into the unit
below. There is




 
excessive clutter and the Tenant has broken through
a wall in the unit to the staircase.
There is also a strong smell of garbage in the Tenant’s unit.
 
4.     I find the Tenant has wilfully caused
undue damage to the rental
unit and that the Tenant has committed an illegal act in the
rental unit and in the residential complex.
 
5.     The damage caused is significantly greater than what
is required to give a notice of termination
pursuant to clause
63(1)(a) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act'). As a result,
the date terminating the tenancy is earlier than the termination date set out in
the notice of termination given by the Landlord.
 
6.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of February
19, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 19, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,699.36, which represents compensation for the use of the
unit from November 3, 2021 to February 14, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$16.34 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from February 15, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
February 19, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 20, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 19, 2022, then starting February
20, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after
February 20, 2022. The Sheriff
is requested to expedite the enforcement of this order.
