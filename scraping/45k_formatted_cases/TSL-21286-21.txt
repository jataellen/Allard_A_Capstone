Adam Hogg


Tenant



 
 
 
Capreit Limited Partnership (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Adam Hogg (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 1, 2021. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Gabriela Quaresma, attended the
hearing. As of 1:53 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period
from March 1, 2021 to
July 31, 2021. Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination effective March 22, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant
vacated the rental
unit on July 26, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $2,085.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.    
 The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,085.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of
July 26, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant possession of the rental unit to
the Landlord.




File Number: TSL-21286-21
 
2.    
 The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$8,060.35*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to July 26, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
18, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 19, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
