In the matter
of:


8, 500 7TH AVENUE E OWEN SOUND ON N4K2X4


 




Between:


Owen Sound
Housing Company Limited


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Michael Beckberger


Tenant



 
 
Owen Sound Housing Company
Limited (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Michael
Beckberger (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 10, 2022. Only
the Landlord's Legal Representative, Shari Huber attended the hearing. As of 10:13 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period from June 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective September 10, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     
The lawful monthly rent is $454.38
effective January 1, 2022.
 
4.      The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $458.67 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021
to January 1, 2022.
 
7.     
The NSF cheque charge
was not substantiated; therefore, the claim was denied.
 
8.     
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact
of COVID-19 on the parties
and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment




 
agreement with the Tenant
and find that it
would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 29, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,751.78*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
18, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $14.94 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 19, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
January 29, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from January 30, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 29, 2022, then starting
January 30, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 30, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before January 29, 2022, the Tenant pays the
amount of $3,582.38** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for
eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after January
30, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
