Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-90716-17
 











 
 

D.G and #.O.L (the 'Landlords') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict A.P (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did
not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
The parties first appeared before
this Board for this matter on January 15, 2018.  The Tenant’s request for
adjournment to obtain legal advice was granted.  An interim order was issued by
Member Rodrigues and myself on January 17, 2018.
 
This application was then heard in Toronto on March
20, 2018.
 
The Landlords and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
The Landlords were
represented by their legal representative, Mr. D.C. The Tenant indicated he had
obtained legal advice on this matter from a community legal clinic.
 
The Tenant had filed a T6
application (TSL-92066-18) to be heard with this application.  At the hearing,
the Tenant requested to withdraw that application so that he may file a new
application to be heard together with another T2 application which he had filed
two days before this hearing.  The Tenant’s request for withdrawal of the T6
application was granted and an order to that effect was issued for that file.
 
Determinations:
 
Failure to pay rent
 
1.     
There is no dispute between
the parties that this tenancy started in April, 2017, and that the monthly rent
is $1,260.00 which includes parking.
2.     
Although the parties
disagreed on the due date of the monthly rent, I note the Tenant’s copy of the
lease agreement states that the rent “shall be payable in advance on or before
the 1st day of each month.” with the exception of the first month’s
rent which “shall be payable on or before the 20th of April, 2017”. 
I therefore agree with the Landlord that except for the month of April 2017,
the rent is due on the first day of each month for this tenancy.
3.     
The Tenant conceded at the
hearing that he has not paid for the period from October 1, 2017 to March 31,
2018, save and except for the month of February 2018. Interim order
TSL-90716-17-IN, issued by Member Rodrigues and myself on January 17, 2018,
stipulates that “Starting February 1, 2018, the Tenant shall pay the rent to
the Landlord, as it comes due and owing to the Landlord, until this application
is disposed of or the Board orders otherwise.” The Tenant has breached this
interim order by failing to pay the rent for March 2018.
4.     
The Landlords collected a
rent deposit of $1,200.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlords.
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 17, 2017 to November 21, 2018.
Section 82
6.     
The Tenant chose not to
raise issues under section 82 at this hearing but indicated he will deal with
those issues at the hearing for his T2 application as well as his pending T6
application.
Section 83 considerations
7.     
The Tenant spoke of his
recovery from Lyme Disease which has affected his ability to work full-time but
provided no medical documents to substantiate this claim. He spoke of working
part-time in the film industry but also indicated that he is collecting
unemployment insurance.  He said he would require about three months to find a
new place to move to. 
8.     
The Landlords objected to a
delay, noting that the tenancy began less than a year ago and they have not
received rent from the Tenant for the past five months. The Landlords assert they
would be put in further financial jeopardy the longer the Tenant is not
evicted.
9.     
I also take note of the
Tenant’s failure to pay the rent for March 2018, thereby breaching the terms of
the interim order TSL-90716-17-IN.
10.  
Having considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), I find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until April 30, 2018, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of
the Act. This delay will provide the Tenant with some additional time to either
obtain the necessary funds or fine a new place to live.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before April 30,
2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlords $4,712.36*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to March 23, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $41.42 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
March 24, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before April 2, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from April
3, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before April 30, 2018, then starting May 1, 2018, the Landlords may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlords, on or after May 1, 2018.
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlords or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $6,490.00 if the payment is made on or before March 31, 2018, or
ii)       $7,750.00 if the payment is made on or before April 30, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after May 1, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlords.
