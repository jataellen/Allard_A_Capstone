Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


David Hind


Tenant



 
 
Malleum Real Estate Management
Corp (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict David
Hind (the 'Tenant') The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on September
29, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord’s agent Cooper Donmoyer
attended the hearing.
The Tenant was not present or represented by 10:30 a.m. or
at any other time during the hearing block.
 
Determinations:
 
Background
 
1.    
The Landlord filed this application on June 14,
2021.
 
2.    
Prior to this, the Landlord gave the Tenant three N5 notices of termination
asserting that the Tenant engaged in
conduct that constitutes substantial interference within the meaning of
subsection 64(1) of the Act, which provides:
 
64 (1) A landlord may give a
tenant notice of termination of the tenancy if the conduct of the tenant,
another occupant of the rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the tenant is such that it substantially interferes with the reasonable enjoyment of the
residential complex for all usual purposes by the landlord or another tenant or
substantially interferes with another lawful right, privilege or interest of
the landlord or another tenant.
 
3.    
The first voidable N5 was given
to the Tenant on February
16, 2021 by mail
and provided a termination date of March
13, 2021. It was deemed
received by the Tenant on February
21, 2021. The voiding period was February 22-28, 2021. The particulars set out
in Schedule A to this notice assert that on January 29, 2021 the Tenant failed
to permit




 
entry for the Landlord
to conduct an inspection after
the Landlord gave the Tenant
a notice of entry.
 
4.    
The second voidable N5 was given
to the Tenant on May 27, 2021 and provided a termination date of June 16, 2021. The voiding period was
May 28, 2021 to June 3, 2021. The particulars set out in Schedule
A to this notice assert that on May 27, 2021 the Tenant failed to permit entry
for the Landlord to replace windows after the Landlord gave the Tenant a notice
of entry.
 
5.     The third non-voidable N5 was given to the Tenant on
June 11, 2021 and provided a termination date of June 25, 2021. The particulars
set out in Schedule A to this notice generally
assert that the Tenant’s interactions with the Landlord
can be characterized as
aggressive, elevated in volume, offensive and abusive. The 7-page schedule
details multiple incidents on May 13, 2021 in which the Tenant left voicemails
for the Landlord between 5:54 a.m. and 5:43 p.m. in which the Tenant variously
called the Landlord offensive names, used abusive language, threatened to fill the Landlord’s voicemail with
garbage for no reason, threatened to get a specific member of the Landlord’s
property management team fired and
refused to modulate the use of vulgar
language despite the presence of children. This schedule
also details similar behaviour on May 25, 2021 between 12:18 p.m. and 9:14
p.m., May 26, 2021 between 12:23 p.m. and 12:35 p.m.,
May 30, 2021 at 3:42 p.m.,
May 31, 2021 at 11:55 a.m. and June 11, 2021 between
6:56
a.m. and 9:56 a.m.
 
6.     The third non-voidable N5 also alleges that on June
10, 2021 the Tenant failed to permit entry for the Landlord to inspect the plumbing after the Landlord
gave the Tenant a notice of entry.
 
What allegations are properly
before me?
 
7.    
Subsection 69(2) of the Act provides
that an application may not be made later than 30
days after the termination date specified in the notice. I therefore cannot
consider the substance of the allegations set out on the first voidable N5.
 
8.     I have jurisdiction to consider the substance of the allegations on the second voidable N5.
 
9.     Subsection 68(1) of the Act provides:
 
68 (1) A landlord
may give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy
if,
 
 
 
(a)    
a
notice of termination was given to the tenant
under section 62, 64 or 67; and
 
 
 
(b)    
more than seven days but less than
six months after the notice mentioned in clause (a) was given to the tenant,
an activity takes
place,




 
conduct occurs or a situation
arises that constitutes grounds for a notice of termination under section 60, 61, 62, 64
or 67, other than an activity, conduct or a situation that is described
in subsection 61 (1) and that involves an illegal act, trade, business or
occupation described in clause 61 (2) (a).
 
10.  The Landlord has given two voidable N5 notices of termination under subsection 64(1) of the Act. The
first was given on February 16, 2021 and the second was given on May 27, 2021.
Since all of the allegations particularized on the third voidable N5 occurred
less than six months after both of the voidable N5s were given to the Tenant, I
have jurisdiction to consider all of the allegations particularized on the
Landlord’s third non- voidable N5 notice of termination.
 
Second voidable N5 notice of termination
 
11.  Subsection 64(3) of the Act provides:
 
64(3) The notice of termination
under subsection (1) is void if the tenant, within seven days after receiving the notice, stops the conduct
or activity or corrects the omission.
 
12.  As noted above, the voiding
period for this notice was May 28, 2021 to June 3,
2021.
 
13.  I accepted the Landlord’s uncontested evidence to the effect that on May 27, 2021 the
Tenant refused the Landlord’s entry to the rental unit despite the Landlord’s
full
compliance with sections 25 and 27 of the Act. The Landlord gave the Tenant
more than 24-hours notice
before the time of entry and the purpose of the entry was to carry out a repair
or replacement of the window. That being said, the Landlord’s agent testified
that the Landlord did not attempt to enter the Tenant’s rental unit again until
after June 3, 2021, after the expiry of the voiding period. On these facts, I
must find that the Tenant stopped the conduct or activity or corrected the
omission within the voiding period. This aspect of the Landlord’s application must
therefore be dismissed.
 
Third non-voidable N5 notice of termination
 
14.  The Landlord’s agent testified that the Landlord
acquired the residential complex on December
17, 2020 and that the Landlord provided
all tenants of the residential complex including the Tenant with an onboarding package
providing information about how to contact the Landlord, including in cases of
emergencies. The information package introduced by the Landlord confirms that,
in cases of emergencies, the Landlord instructed tenants to use the Landlord’s
website or by calling 1-844-275-3844, a telephone number that is monitored
“24/7 for emergency purposes only”.
 
15.  With respect to the phone-calls on the dates
particularized on the Landlord’s third voidable N5 notice of termination (May 13, 2021; May 25, 2021; May 30, 2021; May 31,
2021; and, June 11, 2021), the
Landlord’s agent introduced 13 automatically generated transcripts of
voicemails left by the Tenant on the emergency voicemail as well as audio
recordings. These confirm
that the Tenant was using the emergency
telephone number to raise non-emergency complaints about
the Landlord and its agents and in so doing used




 
rude, abusive, hostile, aggressive, vulgar and insulting language. Examples of the
Tenant’s language include variously describing the Landlord’s staff as
“ignorant”,
“cocksuckers”, “fucking
goof”, “mentally unstable”. In the May 30, 2021,
message the Tenant informs
the Landlord that he enjoys leaving these messages.
 
 
 
16.  The Landlord’s agent testified that there are several
problems with the Tenant’s conduct. On the one hand, the Landlord’s staff do
not want to subject themselves to abuse when dealing with the Tenant.
On the other hand, the Tenant is using the emergency telephone number to raise non-emergency
issues and the Tenant’s multiple invective filled calls, which have sometimes filled
the emergency voicemail, interfere with the Landlord’s ability to respond to real emergencies.
 
17.  In my view, the Tenant’s conduct amounts to a
substantial interference with both the Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment of the
rental unit for all usual purposes as well as a substantial interference with a lawful right,
privilege or interest
of the Landlord and other
tenants of the residential complex.
 
18.  With respect to the former, the Board has found that
behaviour that is rude, abusive, hostile, aggressive and insulting to the
Landlord can constitute substantial interference. See, for example, 3501973
Canada Inc Hazelton Place Retirement Residence v Weiss, 2020 CanLII
118001 (ON LTB).
In this case, while I understand that some of the Tenant’s messages to the Landlord are to
raise complaints, which the Tenant is entitled to do, the Tenant is not
entitled to subject the Landlord’s staff to rude, abusive, hostile, aggressive,
vulgar and insulting language.
 
19.  With respect to the latter, the Landlord is obliged by
section 20 of the Act to be responsible for providing and maintaining a
residential complex in a good state of repair and fit for habitation and for complying
with health, safety, housing and maintenance standards. To do so, the Landlord must maintain an open
line of communication between the tenants
of the residential complex and the Landlord. The Tenant’s
insistence on using the emergency telephone number to raise issues that are
not an emergency and to insult the Landlord substantially interferes with the
Landlord’s ability to meet its legal obligations.
 
20.  I accepted the Landlord’s uncontested evidence that
the Landlord gave the Tenant a notice of entry on June 8, 2021 which informed
the Tenant that entry was scheduled to take place on June 10, 2021 between
11:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. for the purpose of inspecting the building plumbing
fixtures. I accepted
the Landlord’s uncontested evidence that the Tenant refused entry on June 10, 2021. In
circumstances where the Landlord’s notice of entry complied with the
requirements of sections 27 of the Act, the Tenant’s refusal substantially
interfered with the Landlord’s right to enter the unit under section 25 of the
Act.
 
21.  For the above reasons, the Landlord has proven this ground of
termination.
 
Relief from Eviction




 
22.  Section 83(2) of the Act requires me to review the circumstances of both parties
and to consider whether or not
I should exercise my discretion under subsection 83(1) of the Act, which
provides:
 
(a)  (1) Upon an application for an order evicting a tenant, the Board may, despite
any other provision of this Act or the tenancy agreement,
 
(a)    
refuse to grant the application unless satisfied, having
regard to all the
circumstances, that it would be unfair to refuse; or
 
(b)    
order that the enforcement of the eviction
order be postponed
for a period of time.
 
23.  In this case, my finding
is that it would be unfair to refuse
eviction for the following
reasons.
 
24.  First, the Tenant’s September 10, 2021 voicemail to
the Landlord confirms that the Tenant was aware of this proceeding. The Tenant
did not attend and therefore did not provide
evidence on the issue of relief from eviction. The Landlord was not aware of any circumstances of the Tenant that would
favour relief from eviction.
 
25.  Second, I agree with the Landlord’s agent that the Landlord attempted to
address the Tenant’s problematic behaviour without resorting to the Board. The
Landlord’s agent discussed the issue
of leaving abusive
voicemails with the Tenant in December 2020.
Although the Tenant at that
time promised to moderate his language, the Tenant did not keep this promise.
The Landlord sent the Tenant a letter recounting similar incidents between December
30, 2020 and January 18, 2020 informing the Tenant that any further similar incidents would result in
the Landlord bringing an application to the Board. The issues on application
followed.
 
26.  Third, despite the issuance of the third non-voidable
N5 and the bringing of this application, the Landlord
demonstrated that Tenant’s problematic behaviour continues.
The Tenant left messages for the Landlord on July 31, 2021, August 23, 2021 and
September 10, 2021. In these messages
the Tenant tells the Landlord to “fuck off” and calls the Landlord “nasty”
and “fucking morons”. This suggests to me that the Tenant is either unwilling or unable to stop his
problematic behaviour and that conditional relief from eviction would not be
appropriate.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 22, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay
to the Landlord $3,652.56, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from June 26, 2021 to February 11, 2022,
less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord
owes on the rent deposit. The Landlord shall subtract
any amounts already paid by
the Tenant.




 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$18.36 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from February 12, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does
not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February
22, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 23, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 22, 2022, then starting
February 23, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 23, 2022.
