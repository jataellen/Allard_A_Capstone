Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-01869-19
 











 
 
 

Company (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict R.P. and V.B. (the 'Tenants') because they have
been persistently late in paying their rent. 
 
This application was heard in Whitby on August 19,
2019.
 
The Landlord and the first-named Tenant
above (the ‘Tenant’) attended the hearing. The Landlord was represented by D.F.

 
Determinations:
 
1.     
There is no dispute between
the parties that the Tenants have persistently failed to pay the rent on the
date it was due. Although the Landlord’s ledger reflects posting dates instead
of payment dates, the Tenant present at the hearing acknowledges he is often
late. He says he usually pays within the first week of the month. 
2.     
The only real dispute
between the parties is the Tenant’s request for relief pursuant to s. 83 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). 
3.     
The Tenant seeks relief in
the form of a conditional order requiring rent be paid on time and in full. He
proposes to deliver post-dated cheques to the Landlord. The Landlord opposes
the request because of the history between the parties. 
4.     
As I explained at the
hearing, this means the issue for the Board is whether or not it would be
unfair in all of the circumstances to grant the relief sought. 
5.     
This tenancy began in 2014.
6.     
The Tenant is a single
father. He lives in the rental unit with his two children. The older of the two
is about to start college. The younger is going into grade 9.
7.     
The Board’s records show
there have been five prior applications to the Board with respect to this
tenancy. 
8.     
Four of those applications
were for non-payment of rent. In two of those files, the Tenant attended the
hearing and consented to a standard pay and stay order with an extended
termination date. One was abandoned by the Landlord because all of the rent and
costs had been paid. And one was an order for only a fraction of the filing fee
as everything else had been paid by the hearing date. See Board files: TEL-58709-15,
TEL-65992-16, TEL-91246-18, and TEL-98285-19.)
9.     
But the fifth prior
application before the Board was for the same grounds as here. 
10.  
In Board file TEL-69904-16
the Landlord sought eviction for persistent late payment of rent. When the
application came before the Board on July 15, 2016, the parties consented to an
order that preserved the tenancy subject to the requirement that the Tenant pay
rent on time and no later than the first business day of each month for the
period August, 2016 to July, 2017. 
11.  
The Landlord’s ledger shows
that during that period the Tenant mostly paid rent on time in compliance with
the order. But in January of 2017, the ledger indicates his rent cheque bounced
and the rent was not paid until the second week of the month. 
12.  
The ledger also shows that
almost immediately after the prior pay on time order expired, the Tenant once
again was habitually paying rent late. 
13.  
The rents for the months of
September, October and November of 2017 were not paid until the end of the
month in which it was due. December, 2017 was not paid at all and the arrears
were not cleared until the end of February, 2018. The rent for March of 2018
was not paid until the end of the month. No rent was paid for April, 2018 and
the arrears were not cleared until nearly the end of June, 2018. A similar late
or non-payment pattern continues up to today. 
14.  
The Landlord’s notice of
termination for persistent late payment was served on the Tenant on April 29,
2019. April’s rent was not posted to the ledger until April 29, 2019. May’s
rent was paid during the first week of May, but June’s was not posted until
June 14, 2019, July was posted to the account on July 8, 2019 and the Tenant
acknowledges he did not pay August’s rent until August 8, 2019. 
15.  
The Tenant was specifically
asked about his circumstances at the hearing including what changed after the
previous pay on time order had expired. He replied that nothing had really
changed. 
16.  
He says his oldest child is
working for the summer and the Tenant has been able to save some money. He gets
paid every Friday so he just wrote the cheque for August 8, 2019, which was a
Thursday. The Tenant cannot explain why he did this. I pointed out to him that
this behaviour makes no sense in light of his evidence that he has been saving
money over the summer.  He acknowledges he cannot explain his behaviour. 
17.  
As stated above, the issue
for the Board is whether or not it would be unfair in all of the circumstances
to grant the relief sought. 
18.  
Based on all of the evidence
before the Board I find that it would be unfair to put in place another
conditional order preserving the tenancy subject to the requirement to pay on
time. I say this because the history of this tenancy clearly shows the Tenant
is aware of the obligation to pay on time but is either unwilling or unable to
do so. And he cannot explain it. In other words, the evidence shows that if the
tenancy continues the Tenant is more likely than not to default on the
obligation to pay rent on time again. That would result in the Landlord having
to pursue additional legal proceedings resulting in additional expense. Given
how many chances this Landlord has already given to this Tenant, that would
clearly be unfair to the Landlord. 
19.  
As a result, the Tenant’s
request for relief in the form of a conditional order shall be denied. 
20.  
The tenancy terminated for
persistent late payment of rent on June 20, 2019 pursuant to the Landlord’s N8
notice of termination. The Landlord is entitled to an eviction order. 
21.  
That being said, the
Landlord is not averse to the eviction being delayed to permit the Tenant
additional time to find new housing and move. It is holding a last month’s rent
deposit for the Tenant so the Landlord suggests the Tenant be given until
September 30, 2019 to move out. As a result, I find
that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction
until September 30, 2019 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
22.  
The Landlord incurred costs
of $190.00 for filing the application and is entitled to reimbursement of those
costs.
23.  
This order contains all of
the reasons for the decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.
It is ordered that:
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenants is terminated as of June 30, 2019 for persistent late
payment of rent. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
September 30, 2019.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
3.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing on or before September 3, 2019, they will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from September
4, 2019 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
4.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before September 30, 2019, then starting October 1, 2019, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
5.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after October 1, 2019.
