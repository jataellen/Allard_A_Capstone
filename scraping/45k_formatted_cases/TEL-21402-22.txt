Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-21402-22
 
 



In the
  matter of:


302, 1457 KINGSTON ROAD TORONTO ON M1N1R5


 




Between:


1034523 Ontario
  Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Muti Mabayeki


Tenant



 
 
 
1034523 Ontario Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Muti Mabayeki (the 'Tenant') and for an
order to have the Tenant pay the rent he owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by
the Board on January 26, 2022 with
respect to application TEL-18206-21-RV.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition(s) specified in the order: The Tenant failed to pay the first installment of the arrears
in the amount of $3880.00,
which was due on or before January 24, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $5,413.68 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order TEL-18206-21-RV. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $5,413.68 and that amount
is included in this
order. As a result, the previous order
TEL-18206-21-RV is cancelled.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $867.77
from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.




 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from August 1, 1996 to
February 15, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TEL-18206-21-RV is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 26, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$3,784.57* (less any amount paid to the Landlord
after this application was filed on January 28, 2021). This amount represents
the rent owing up to February 15, 2022 and the costs related to the application
fee for the previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $32.55 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 16, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 26, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
February 27, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 26, 2022, then starting February
27, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 27, 2022.
 
 
February 15, 2022

The tenant
has until February
25, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order
under s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by February 25, 2022
the order will be stayed and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on August 27, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
