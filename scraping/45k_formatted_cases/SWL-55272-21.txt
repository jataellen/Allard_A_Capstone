Ouellette Place
Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Terence Turner (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
13, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Debbie Schmutz, attended the
hearing. As of 10:52 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 24, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on
October 25, 2021. The Tenant was in possession
of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,200.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,200.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 1, 2021 to September 24, 2021.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of October
25, 2021, the date the Tenant returned
vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.

2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $2,169.52*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to October
25, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
2, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 3, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
