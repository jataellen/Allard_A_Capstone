of:


205, 190 CANTERBURY COURT SARNIA ON N7T7P8


 




Between:


Capreit Limited Partnership


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Sasha
  Fritz


Tenant



 
 
 
Capreit Limited
Partnership (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Sasha Fritz (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes
because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by
the Board on August 19, 2021 with respect to application SWL-49713-21.
 
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could
apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $1000.00 arrears
on or before November 27, 2021.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $5,249.83 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's
application fee in Order SWL-49713-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $1,155.00
and that amount is included
in this order. As a result,
the previous order
SWL-49713-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed
to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.




 
 
 
 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,085.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 2, 2020
to January 14, 2022.
 
 
 
It is
ordered that:
 
 
1.    
Order SWL-49713-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 25, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$568.30*. This amount
represents the rent owing up to January 14, 2022 and the costs
related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $35.67
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 15, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
25, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 25, 2022, then starting
January 26, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 26, 2022.
 
January 14, 2022                                                                               Date Issued                                                                       Jim McMaster

The tenant has until January 24, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 24, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires

with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction
where the rental unit is located.
