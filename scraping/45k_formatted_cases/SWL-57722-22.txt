In the
  matter of:


B,
  276 KARN AVENUE WOODSTOCK ON N4S3X4


 




Between:


Oxford County
Housing


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Terra-Lyn Macknott


Tenant



 
 
 
Oxford County Housing (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Terra-Lyn
Macknott (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the
Tenant owes because the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified
in the mediated settlement issued by the Board on January 27, 2022
with respect to application SWL-56051-21.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The mediated settlement provided that the Landlord
could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the
Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the settlement.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following conditions specified in the settlement: The Tenant did not pay $109.37 arrears on
or before February 1, 2022. The Tenant did not pay $636.00 rent on or before
February 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting mediated settlement required
the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of
the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request
an order for the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The amount that is still owing, according to the terms
of the mediated settlement, for arrears of rent, and the costs related
to the application fee for the previous
application is
$2,409.37.
 
5.     Since the date of the mediated settlement, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that
became owing for the period from February 1, 2022 to February 28, 2022.

the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before March 7, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,911.20*. This amount represents the rent owing up to February 24, 2022 and the

The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$20.91 per day for compensation for the use of

5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 7, 2022, then starting

Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
