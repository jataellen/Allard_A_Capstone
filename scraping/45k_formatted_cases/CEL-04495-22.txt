Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-04495-22
 
 



In the
  matter of:


304, 1475
BLOOR STREET MISSISSAUGA ON L4X1R7


 




Between:


Imh Pool Xv Lp


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Tai Judah Reid Tammica Niles


Tenants



 
 
 
Imh Pool Xv Lp (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tai Judah Reid and
Tammica Niles (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent
they owe because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board
on September 27, 2021 with respect to application CEL-00974-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants have not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenants did not pay $650.00 arrears
on or before December 15, 2021. The Tenants
did not pay $2535.06 rent on or before January 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $4,301.00 for rent
arrears and NSF cheque charges and the costs related to the Landlord's
application fee in Order CEL-00974-21. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $2,446.00 and that amount
is included in this
order. As a result, the previous order CEL-00974-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,511.27 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from November
18, 2020 to February 3, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order CEL-00974-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 14, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlord $2,717.30*. This amount represents the rent owing up to February 3, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$83.34 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 4, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
14, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 15, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 14, 2022, then starting February
15, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 15, 2022.
 
 
February 3, 2022

The tenant has until February 13, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by February 13, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on August 15, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
