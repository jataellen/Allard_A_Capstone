Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: SWL-12927-18
AV (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict JJ (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (the ‘L1
Application’).
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant has been
persistently late in paying the Tenant’s rent (the ‘L2 Application’).
 
These applications
were heard in Waterloo on April 9, 2018.  The Landlord’s Legal Representative,
LN, and the Tenant attended the hearing.  The Tenant declined the opportunity
to speak with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing. 
 
Determinations and
Reasons:
The L1 Application 
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the
Tenant was required to pay for the period from December 1, 2017 to April 30,
2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective January 19, 2018.
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,400.00.
4.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit of
$1,400.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
5.     Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenant for the period from November 15, 2016 to January 19, 2018.
6.     The Tenant paid $2,800.00 after the application
was filed.
7.     The parties agree that the amount outstanding to
April 30, 2018, inclusive of rent arrears ($4,200.00) and costs ($190.00), is
$4,390.00. 
8.     While the Tenant initially indicated that he did
not intend to raise any other issues with respect to the tenancy pursuant to
section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’), he subsequently
attempted to raise issues partway through the hearing, after the Landlord’s
Legal Representative had closed her case.  To hear the Tenant on these issues
at this point in the hearing would have unfairly prejudiced the Landlord.  As
well, since the Tenant had not disclosed the issues in question prior to the
hearing date, the Landlord’s Legal Representative was not in a position to
address them.  Consequently, these issues will form no part of the order to
follow.  The Tenant remains free to file his own application(s) with the
Landlord and Tenant Board (the ‘Board’) with respect to these matters, subject
to the applicable limitation provisions under the Act.
9.     The Tenant took the position that as there had
been a prior hearing, all of the matters in the present applications had been
adjudicated and therefore the doctrine of res judicata applies. 
However, while the Landlord filed a previous combined L1 and L2 Application, SWL-05845-17,
that application addressed arrears for the period ending September 30, 2017 and
the Tenant’s failure to pay water bills for the rental unit, not persistent
late payment.  As the grounds for termination in SWL-05845-17 are unrelated to
the present application, I find that res judicata does not apply and the
applications are properly before the Board.
10.  It is worth noting that although the parties entered into a
mediated agreement with respect to application SWL-05845-17 on September 5,
2017, the Tenant breached the terms of that agreement and on September 29,
2017, the Board issued order SWL-08436-17 for termination of the tenancy.  On
November 15, 2018, the parties proposed an order on consent with respect to the
Tenant’s motion to set aside that order.
11.  The Tenant did not contest the testimony of the Landlord’s
Legal Representative that the issues with the unpaid water bill remained
outstanding as of the present hearing date.  The Tenant agreed at the hearing
that he was once again in arrears of rent.
12.  For all of these reasons, the Landlord opposed a new
conditional order and sought termination of the tenancy.
13.  With respect to the present arrears, despite his agreement
with the Landlord’s calculations, the Tenant took the inexplicable position
that he need only pay the Landlord $2,930.00 to resolve the L1 Application.  I
find that he was unable to explain this position coherently at the hearing.
The L2 Application 
14.   The Tenant has persistently failed to pay the
rent on the date it was due.  Specifically, since January, 2017, the Tenant paid
the monthly rent in full and on or before the first day of the month when it
was due for only August, October and November, 2017.  
15.   The Tenant acknowledged these late payments, but
testified that he had an informal agreement with the Landlord allowing him to
pay late for January and February, 2018 as compensation for expenses that he
incurred in relation to his father passing away.  He agreed that this alleged
agreement was never reduced to writing.  However, even if the Tenant had the
Landlord’s consent to pay “when he could” for these two months, there was no
indication that this consent extended to the other eleven months when he was
late with the rent.
16.   The Landlord’s Legal Representative noted that
the Landlord is not a large corporate entity and the Tenant’s late payments
have resulted in financial hardship.
17.   Nonetheless, the Tenant testified that he
required additional time to vacate the rental unit as his daughter attends a
specialized school in close proximity to the residence.  I find that his
request a postponement to May 31, 2018 would unduly prejudice the Landlord due
to both the increasingly substantial arrears outstanding and the Tenant’s
chequered record of compliance with past orders.  However, in light of all of
the evidence, I find that the Tenant will reasonably require some additional
time to secure new accommodations.
18.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act and find that it would not be
unfair to postpone the eviction until April 30, 2018, pursuant to subsection
83(1)(b) of the Act.
19.  This order contains all of the reasons in this matter and
no further reasons will issue.
It is ordered that:
The L1 Application 
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,823.44*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to April 11,
2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
2.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $46.03
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting April 12, 2018 to the
date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before April 30, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe
interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from May 1, 2018 at 3.00%
annually on the balance outstanding.
The L2 Application 
5.     The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before April
30, 2018.
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before April
30, 2018, then starting May 1, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord, on or after May 1, 2018.
