  HAMILTON ON L8R3J4


 




Between:


Equiton Residential Income

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Sarah
Lima


Tenant



 
 
 
Equiton Residential Income Fund LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Sarah Lima (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on January 11, 2022. The Landlord’s Legal
Representative, Daniel Abraham
and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
The Tenant declined
the opportunity to speak with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective September 24, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
As of January 1, 2022, the monthly rent for the unit is
$1,033.22.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,020.55 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 1, 2019
to September 24, 2021.
 
6.    
The Tenant
paid $2,850.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.    
It is uncontested the total rent arrears owing by the Tenant to the Landlord,
up to January 31, 2022 is $2267.00.




 
8.    
The Tenant stated she
was having some financial difficulties but now has a roommate who will pay ½ of the rent and she will not only be able to pay her full rent moving
forward but can also pay an additional $1000.00 by the end of the week
and a minimum $150.00 per month towards the remaining arrears. She presently is
unemployed but will be receiving $1100.00 per month from ODSP.
 
9.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including the Tenant’s personal and financial
circumstances and weighed this against any potential prejudice to the Landlord
and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,468.10, which represents the arrears of rent
($2,267.10), and costs ($201.00) outstanding for the period ending January 31,
2022.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s application for eviction
of the Tenant is denied
on the condition that:
 
•        
The Tenant
shall pay $1,000.00
to the Landlord on or before January
21, 2022.
 
•        
The Tenant shall pay
$250.00 to the Landlord on or before the 1st of each month commencing on February 1, 2022, up to and including June 1, 2022.
 
•        
The Tenant
shall pay $218.10
to the Landlord on or before July 1, 2022.
 
•        
The Tenant shall also pay the Landlord the rent for the months of February 2022 up to and including
July 2022 in full, on or before the first day of each corresponding month.
 
3.    
If the Tenant fails
to make any of the payments in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates required, then:
 
(a)  
The Landlord may apply
under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for
an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, and for the payment
of any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not already ordered under paragraph
1 of this order. The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a
breach of a condition set out in paragraph 2 of this order.
 
(b)   The balance owing under paragraph 1 of this
order shall become payable on the day following the date of default.
The monies owing shall bear interest at the post-judgment interest rate determined under subsection
207(7) of the Act.
