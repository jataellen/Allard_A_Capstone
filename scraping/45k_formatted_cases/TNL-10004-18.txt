Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-10004-18



 


 


 



 
 
QRP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict YSC (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes.  The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant has been persistently late
in paying the Tenant's rent.  The Landlord also claimed compensation for each
day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date
 
This application was heard in Toronto on November 26,
2018.
 
Only the Landlord’s
representative, BR, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The Tenant has persistently failed to pay the
rent on the date it was due.
 
2.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from September 1, 2018
to November 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination.
 
3.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $2,123.54 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
 
4.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 1, 2018 to December 14, 2018.
 
5.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
L1 application:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before December
27, 2018.
 
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $5,197.55*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to December 14, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes
on the rent deposit.
 
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $69.82 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
December 15, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before December 27, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
December 28, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before December 27, 2018, then starting December 28, 2018, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after December 28, 2018.
 
8.     
If, on or before December
27, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $8,684.16** to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after December 28, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
 
L2 application:
10.  
If the Tenant voids the
eviction order pursuant to paragraph 8 or 9 of the order, then the Tenant shall
pay the rent as it comes due on the first day of each month, no later than the
first day of each month from January 2019 to December 2019, inclusive.
 
11.  
Section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 applies to paragraph 10 this order. If the Tenant fails
to make any payment, the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to
the Board for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The
Landlord must make this application no later than 30 days after the Tenant
fails to make a payment.
