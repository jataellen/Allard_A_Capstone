Derek Anderson


Tenant



 
 
 
The Effort Trust
Company (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Derek Anderson (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have
the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant
owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued
by the Board on July 20, 2021 with respect to application
SOL-20111-21.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved by order SOL-24304-21, issued on September
17, 2021. The Tenant filed a
motion to set aside order SOL-24304-21.
 
This motion was heard by video conference on December 3, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s legal
representative, K. Holleran,
and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant admits that he breached
order SOL-20111-21, issued on July 20, 2021, by
failing to pay the rent in full on or before August 1, 2021, and also by
failing to pay
$551.66 towards
the arrears on or before August 1, 2021.
 
2.    
The monthly
rent is $1,049.00.
 
3.    
The Tenant
said that he has made no payments
to the Landlord since
August, 2021. He said that he consented to the payment plan at the end of
June, 2021, because he believed he could get enough money together
from his assistant
superintendent work as well as
building computers, to meet the payment plan.
 
4.    
The Tenant said that he went back to work in August, 2021. However, he also said that
he has made no payments to the Landlord since August, 2021, because he had
other bills that were “piling up”.




File Number: SOL-24304-21-SA
 
5.    
The Tenant said that he can start making
payments to the Landlord of $1,400.00 per month. He said that he makes $25.20 per hour, plus over time.
 
6.    
The Tenant said that he wants to remain in the rental unit because he has lived there for three years, and his daughter comes to
stay with him every second weekend. He
said that it has been difficult to find an alternative place to rent within his
budget.
 
7.    
The Tenant said that he has not reached
out to the Landlord to discuss the situation
because he is not getting along with the superintendent.
 
8.    
The Landlord submits
that the stay on the eviction should be lifted. The Landlord’s legal representative said that the Tenant has never contacted the Landlord to discuss the non-
payment of rent or arrears. The
Landlord submits that the payment plan that resulted from the hearing in June,
2021, and the order issued on July
20, 2021, was proposed by the Tenant himself.
The Landlord’s legal representative said that the Landlord has not
received rent in almost a year, and it is prejudicial to the Landlord for the
tenancy to continue.
 
9.    
The Tenant proposed a
payment plan at the end of June, 2021, and he almost immediately breached it. He said that he did not begin full time
work until August, 2021, so his payment
plan, consented to by the Landlord, was not realistic. The Tenant has not
paid anything to the Landlord since then. The
arrears are substantial, at almost
$11,000.00, and
approaching double what they were in June, 2021. I find that the tenancy is no longer
viable, as the Tenant has not proved,
on a balance of probabilities, that he has the income to
support the monthly rent.
 
10.  Having considered all of the disclosed
circumstances above in accordance with subsection 78(11) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”), I find that it would be unfair to set aside eviction
order SOL-24304-21. In particular, the Tenant is unlikely to pay his rent in full and on time as it
becomes due and owing.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The motion
to set aside Order SOL-24304-21, issued on September 17, 2021, is denied.
 
2.    
The stay of order SOL-24304-21 is lifted immediately.
