In the matter
of:


2D, 4 COLUMBUS AVENUE OTTAWA ON K1K1R3


 




Between:


Emily Salzer
  Eric Ward


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Maliheh Sarikahny
  Mobina Esmi


Tenants



 
 
 
Emily Salzer and Eric Ward (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Maliheh Sarikahny and Mobina
Esmi (the 'Tenants')
 
This application was heard by videoconference on September 1, 2021.
 
The Landlords, the Tenants’
Legal Representative, Reyhaneh
Lajevardi, and the Tenants
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
1.     The Landlords submitted that the Tenants
denied them access
to the unit on May 3 and 4, 2021 and on February 20, 2021.
 
2.     The Landlords further
submitted that the Tenants interfered with the showing
of the unit by harassing the Landlords’ representatives when they
attended the property.
 
3.     The Landlords testified that in February 2021, their
Realtor was denied access to the property despite their efforts to accommodate the Tenants and attend at a time that was mutually agreeable.
 
4.     The Landlords submitted
that when the parties agreed
upon dates, the Tenants cancelled on very short notice.
 
5.     The Tenants submitted
that they denied
access on February
20, 2021, because
one of them was sick, and
they provided a medical note to the Landlords on that day.
 
6.    
The Landlords submitted that the Tenants
sent a message to the Landlord at 8:20 a.m. stating that they would not accept
another date and that the only date available for showing the property is February 20, 2021. On February 20, 2021 when the Landlords’




 
Realtor attended the property
at the time the Tenants
insisted upon, she was denied access and sent an email offering
for the Realtor to come back that same day later.
 
7.    
The Landlords also submitted that the sick note provided
by the Tenants on February
20, 2021 was sent after the Landlords’ Realtor was denied access to the
property.
 
8.     The Tenants submitted that they are very susceptible
(high risk) to being infected by Covid-19, because of their health condition. However,
the doctors’ notes
that the Tenants provided are dated June and July
2021. The Landlords submitted that these medical notes were not provided to
them until after the notices were served on the Tenants.
 
9.     The Tenants alleged
that the Landlords
harass them by giving them multiple N5
notices.
 
10.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1)
of the Act. I am satisfied that the Tenants
interfered with the Landlords and their Realtors by denying them access to the
property on several occasions. The Tenants admitted at the hearing that they
did in fact deny the Landlords/Realtors access on the dates claimed by the
Landlords. The Landlords made reasonable efforts to accommodate the Tenants and
attended the property at times that were convenient for the Tenants. However,
the Tenants are not flexible with respect to the time viewings can be done and
they cancel confirmed appointments on short notice. The Tenants have
preferences, such as having virtual viewings only and restricting Realtors
access to the unit to after 4 p.m. The reason provided by the Tenants for
allowing viewings only after 4 p.m. is that the Tenants children have online
school during the day. It may be more convenient for the Tenants to have the
viewings after 4 p.m., however it is not a valid reason to deny the Landlords
or their representatives’ access to the property. I understand the Tenants preference to have virtual
viewings only, but this is not a legitimate reason to deny the
Landlords the right to have in-person viewings when selling their property. It
was made clear at the hearing that the Tenants do not want the Landlords or
their Realtors to access the property, because they fear the health risks
associated with being in the presence of strangers. While these risks may be a
genuine concern for the Tenants, they are not cooperating with the Landlords to
reduce these risks. The medical evidence supporting their health conditions was
submitted to the Landlords after they initiated this application. The
harassment allegations raised by the Tenants were unfounded. The Landlords have
a right to submit multiple N5 notices when there are numerous infractions such
as in this case. I see no reason to deny the Landlords’ eviction request.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated, as of
February 1, 2022. The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before February 12, 2022.
