Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-25712-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


202, 2890 ST. CLAIR AVENUE
E TORONTO ON M4B1N6


 




Between:


North 44 Properties


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Samantha Amello
  Vito Amello


Tenants



 
 
 
North 44 Properties (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Vito Amello and Samantha Amello
(the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on August 11,
2021 with respect to application TSL-20876-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants
have not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The
Tenants failed to $110.00 towards the arrears, on or before October 21, 2021. The Tenants failed to pay the lawful
monthly rent in full, on or before November 1, 2021.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $818.72 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order TSL-20876-21. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $704.36 and that amount is
included in this order. As a result, the previous order TSL-20876-21 is
cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from October 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.




 
6.    
Since the date of the order, the Landlord
incurred charges of $5.00 for cheques tendered by or on behalf of the Tenants
which were returned NSF and $20.00 for related administration charges.
 
7.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,111.79 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
8.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from November 1, 2020 to January 7, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order TSL-20876-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 18, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $2,002.69*. This amount
represents the rent owing up to January 7, 2022 and the total
charges related to NSF cheques tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenants
and the costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$36.55 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 8, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
18, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January
19, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 19, 2022.

The tenant has until January 17, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 17, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.
 
If you have any questions about this order,
call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.
 
In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on July 19, 2022 if
the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
