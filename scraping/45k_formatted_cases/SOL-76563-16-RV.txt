Review
Order
 
N. V. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict R. E. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did
not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved by order
SOL-76563-16 issued on December 14, 2016.
 
On January 13, 2017, the Tenant requested a
review of the order.
 
The request was heard in Hamilton on February
13, 2017.
 
The Landlord and the
Landlord’s Legal Representative, A. C., attended the hearing.  The Tenant and
the Tenant’s Legal Representative, B. J., attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
 
Not Reasonably Able
to Participate
 
1.     
At the hearing, I rendered
an oral ruling, granting the review. I set out my reasons below.  
 
2.     
The Tenant has acquired
brain injury (ABI).  He suffers from cognitive impairment which impacts his
impulse control and ability to think and fully comprehend his circumstances and
the consequences of his words and actions.  He also has difficulty articulating
and asserting himself.  His speech is halting and mumbled.  He is vulnerable to
pressure, and is easily confused and intimidated, due to his diminished
understanding.  
 
 
 
                                                                                                                      Order

3.     
The Tenant has resided in
the unit for 33 years, since 1984.  His parents always assisted him with government
processes and dealing with paperwork.  They assisted him with his finances,
including making his monthly rent payments.  He started having difficulty with
his finances when his parents died in 2013 (his mother) and 2015 (his father). 
He fell behind in arrears because his new girlfriend borrowed money from him
and did not pay him back.  In the Tenant’s words, “I screwed up”.  
 
4.     
Having listened to the
recording of the hearing on December 13, 2016, I find that the Tenant did not
understand that he had the option and opportunity to request relief from
eviction.  When asked by the Member how he would pay the arrears, he did not
understand that he had the option to propose a payment plan.  It did not even
occur to him, as he lacked the capacity to formulate a plan.  When it was put
to the Tenant that even with the $800.00 Housing Stability Benefit, he would
still owe considerable arrears to the Landlord, the Tenant could not
contemplate a “way out”.  He could not formulate or articulate any alternative
to eviction.  He voiced what he thought was the only possible outcome - “He
[the Landlord] wants me out” and “I’m looking for a place” “I’ll go everyday, I’ll
look everyday”. The Member accepted the Tenant’s projection of what he, in his
confusion and limited intellectual capacity, believed was his inescapable fate,
as the Tenant’s informed and voluntary consent to termination of the tenancy.  

 
5.     
I find that there was no
inquiry into the Tenant’s personal circumstances and his apparent cognitive
impairment.  There was no exploration of how the Tenant’s needs could be
accommodated in the proceeding.  There was no inquiry into whether the Tenant
needed assistance or even legal representation in the proceeding.  The process
was not slowed down to allow the Tenant to process the information, to formulate
a response or to consider options.  I find that the Tenant’s needs were not
accommodated in the proceeding.  
 
6.     
Subsection 209 (2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”) provides:
 
Without
limiting the generality of section 21.2 of the Statutory Powers Procedure Act,
the Board’s power to review a decision or order under that section may be
exercised if a party to a proceeding was not reasonably able to participate in
the proceeding.
 
7.     
As held in King-Winton v.
Doverhold Investments Limited (13 November 2008) Court File No. 554/07
(“King-Winton”), the principles of justice require a broad interpretation of the
“ability to participate”.   In TSL-83969-RV-IN (August 31, 2006), the
Board stated that “[m]ere attendance at a hearing does not ensure natural
justice or meaningful participation in the resolution of an application”.  
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                                                                      Order

8.     
Applying the King-Winton
broad interpretation, I find that the Tenant was not reasonably able to
participate in the proceeding.  While physically present, the Tenant was unable
to meaningfully participate in the hearing, due to his cognitive impairment. 
 
9.     
I find that there was no
accommodation of the Tenant’s needs, amounting to a serious error in the proceeding
which denied the Tenant natural justice or the right to have a meaningful
opportunity to participate in the resolution of the Landlord’s application.
 
De Novo Hearing of
the Landlord’s Application 
 

10.   The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to
pay for the period from September 1, 2016 to February 28, 2017.  Because of the
arrears, the landlord served a Notice of Termination effective November 18,
2016.
 
11.   The monthly rent is $635.00.
 
12.   The parties agreed that the amount outstanding to February 28, 2017,
inclusive of rent arrears ($3,120.00) and costs ($170.00), is $3,290.00. 
 
13.   The Landlord requested a standard eviction order.  
 
14.   The Tenant is eligible to receive the Housing Stability Benefit in
the amount of $800.00 upon receipt of verification of a payment plan between
the Tenant and the Landlord.
 
15.   The Tenant, through his Legal Representative, proposed to pay the
balance of $2,490.00 ($3,290.00 less $800.00) over an 18-month period in
monthly installments of $138.33 on the 1st day of each month in
addition to his lawful monthly rent.  
 
16.   I am mindful of the Tenant’s 33 years of tenancy. I have also
considered that over these many years, the Tenant had no issues with regard to payment
of rent.  His parents received his disability cheques, kept him on a regimented
budget and doled out funds to him for each specific need or expense, including
his rent for housing.   He fell into arrears when his parents died and he lost
their support and assistance in managing his finances.  Clearly, the Tenant’s
disability was a factor behind his failure to pay rent.  Allowing the arrears
payment plan is consistent with the duty to accommodate under the Human
Rights Code. 
 
17.   I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Order SOL-76563-16 issued on
December 15, 2016 is cancelled and replaced by the following order. 
                                                                                                                      Order
