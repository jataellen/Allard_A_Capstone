Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-48338-21
 
 
In the matter of:      412, 695 TALBOT STREET
LONDON ON N6A2T8
 
Between:                  Terracorp Management Inc.                                    Landlord
 
 
and
 




Abdelhaq Hamza Oussama Hamza


Tenants




 
 
 
Terracorp Management Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Oussama
Hamza and Abdelhaq Hamza (the 'Tenants') because they, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone
they permitted in the residential complex have
substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or
another tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 29, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Kevin O’Brian, attended the hearing. As
of 12:52 p.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The lease agreement between the parties requires the
Tenants to have content, fire and liability insurance and to provide
proof that they have the requisite tenant
insurance in full force and effect upon request of the
Landlord.
 
2.     The Landlord demonstrated that it requested the required proof of
insurance but the Tenant’s failed to provide the
requisite proof prior to the filing of this application.
 
3.     In Stanbar Properties Ltd. v. Rooke [2005] O.J. No. 6363 (Ont. Cup.Ct.,
Div.) at para. 10, the Ontario Superior Court made the
following finding:
 
The refusals of the respondent
to arrange for pre-authorized debit and to provide proof of insurance coverage
were in breach
of consensual provisions of the tenancy agreement to which he was a part
and, in the language of section 64(1) of the Act, his refusals substantially
interfered with the appellant’s lawful rights acquired by it as a result of the
agreement.

4.    
In accordance with Stanbar, I find that the Tenants’
failure or refusal
to provide requested proof of insurance coverage
served as a complete interference with that lawful right.
 
5.     After the Landlord
filed this application, the Tenant’s provided
proof of insurance
to the Landlord on March 9,
2021. As a result, the order will be limited to costs only and not eviction.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
2.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before
March 5, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 6, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
