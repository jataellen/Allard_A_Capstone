In the matter of:


304, 558 DURHAM
CRESCENT WOODSTOCK ON N4S5X3


 




Between:


Sireg Management Inc.


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Robert Wilson


Tenant



 
Sireg Management Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Robert Wilson (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 3, 2022. The Landlord’s Agent, Navya Menon and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period
from December 1, 2020 to
February 28, 2022. Because of the
arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the lawful monthly rent for the unit is $833.48.
 
4.     The Tenant made no payments
after the application was filed.
 
5.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find
that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
6.     The Tenant testified that they were hospitalized and
had been pronounced dead on or about May 29, 2021 and that they are still recovering from the incident. The Tenant also indicated that they are on a limited
ODSP income and have lived in the unit for 7 years. The Tenant requested a payment plan in order to catch up on the arrears
within a period of 4 month’s because they are
expecting a settlement from a lawsuit in the near future.
 
7.    
The Landlord’s representative was opposed to the request
because they indicated that the Tenant communicated with them in November that
he was deliberately withholding his rent and that the Board
should consider this conduct and not grant the Tenant with




 
relief. The representative also indicated that the Tenant was not
cooperative in discussing any payment
plan because the Tenant had become aggressive towards the
representative in a discussion on January 27, 2022.
 
8.    
Based on the evidence before me
and the circumstances of both parties, I find it reasonable to order the Tenant
to make the payments they proposed under a
payment plan. The arrears in the
application stem back to December of 2020. Aside
from the Landlords recent correspondence with the Tenant
regarding the arrears
on January 27, 2022, I am not satisfied that the
Landlord attempted to negotiate an agreement for a payment plan with the Tenant
for the period which fell between December of 2020 to November of 2021 as
required by subsection 83(6) of the Act.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $7,489.96, which
represents the arrears of rent and costs outstanding for the period ending
February 28, 2022.
 
2.     The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant is denied
on the condition that:
 
(a) 
The Tenant shall pay the Landlord
as follows:
 
 



Date Payment Due


Amount of Payment




March 1, 2022


$400.00
(costs and arrears)




April 1,2022


$400.00
(arrears)




May 1, 2022

June 1, 2022


$400.00
(arrears)




June 30, 2022


$5,889.96
(balance of the arrears)



 
(b)  The
Tenant shall also pay the Landlord the rent for the months
of March 2022 up to and including June 2022 in
full, on or before the first day of each corresponding month.
3.    
If the Tenant fails
to make any of the payments in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates required, then:




 
(a)  The Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’) for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, and for
the payment of any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not already ordered
under paragraph 1 of this order. The Landlord must make the application within
30 days of a breach of a condition set out in paragraph 2 of this order.
 
(b)  The balance owing
under paragraph 1 of this order shall
become payable on the
day following the date of default. The monies owing shall bear interest at the post- judgment interest rate determined
under subsection 207(7) of the Act.
