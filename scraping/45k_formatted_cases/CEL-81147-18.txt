Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
File Number: CEL-81147-18











 




In the matter of:


 


 




 


 


 




Between:


B M


Landlord




 


 


 




 


and


 




 


 


 




 


A L


Tenant




 


 


 



 
B M (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict A L (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Mississauga on March 8,
2019.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s
Respresentative, G B, the Tenant and the Tenant’s Representative, M. K attended
the hearing.
 
The application was amended LB is
removed as a party as determined by interim order CEL-81147-18 issued on
January 28, 2019.
 
 At the hearing the Tenant raised the following issues
pursuant to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'): The Tenant alleges the Landlord failed to meet his maintenance
obligation with respect to the following issues: roof leak, ceiling in the
master bedroom, furnace, mold in the basement, 3 toilets air conditioner and
washing machine; the Tenant is also alleging that substantial non-repairs
justifies substantial abatement and the doctrine of laches should be applied. 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent of $92,070.00 the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
February 1, 2014 to March 31, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective November 17, 2018.
2.     
The N4 Notice of Termination
substantially complies.  
3.     
The Tenant has paid
$5,940.00 to the Board in trust since the application was filed. **.
4.     
The Tenant owes the Landlord
$86,130.00 ($92,070.00-$5,940.001).
5.     
The amount the Tenant owes
the Landlord is greater than the Board’s monetary jurisdiction of $25,000.00 as
set out in section 207 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'). 
6.     
The Landlord has chosen not
to proceed at Superior Court for the full amount and is aware that by
proceeding at the Board any claim the Landlord may have for arrears in excess
of $25,000.00 is extinguished.
7.     
While the Tenant has made
payments into the Board in trust under the interim orders issued December 12,
2018 and January 28, 2019, application of these deposit to the arrears does not
reduce the amount the Tenant’s owe to less than $25,000.00. 
8.     
The Tenant also owes the
Landlord $190.00 for the cost of the application. 
9.     
There is a one year
statutory limitation for a tenant to make an application. Section 29(1) of the
Act states, “No application may be made under subsection (1) more than one year
after the day the alleged conduct giving rise to the application occurred”. In
this case, the Tenant did not file an application but has the right to raise
his own issues under section 82 of the Act under the Landlord’s L1 application.

10.  
I considered, the Tenant’s maintenance
issues that fall within the one year limitation period related to the roof
leak, master bedroom ceiling, toilets, furnace, mold in the basement, air conditioner
and washing machine.
11.  
The air-conditioner broke
down in August 2018 and the Tenant repaired it in August 2018. 
12.  
The washing machine that
requires repair is the Tenant’s property, The Landlord cannot be reasonably
responsible for the costs of the repairs. 
13.  
It’s unclear what the
problem is with the furnace. It may be old and not energy efficient but that
does not support a finding that repair and replacement of the furnace is
required.
14.  
Although the Tenant states
there is roof leak, his own evidence indicates that the shingles on the roof
were replaced in 2017. The Tenant alleges that there is a leak in the master
bedroom which requires repair. There was limited evidence presented on this
issue, but the Landlord, now that he knows about the problem must investigate
and repair the roof and ceiling in the master bedroom and ensure they are in a
good state of repair.  
15.  
The Tenant also stated there
is mold in the basement and carpet damage. Again there were no photographs to
support the Tenant’s allegation. The Landlord, now that he knows about the
problem, must investigate and do all necessary repairs to ensure the basement
is in a good state of repair.  
16.  
It is noted the Tenant’s
Representative provided a list of maintenance issues to the Landlord’s
Representative prior to this hearing. The Landlord has not investigated the
problems because it was stated the Tenant is refusing entry which he disputed. Without
making a finding on this issue, the parties agreed at the hearing that the
Landlord shall inspect the rental unit on March 7, 2019 between 9:00 a.m. and
12:00 a.m. The Landlord concedes to investigate and conduct the necessary repairs
related to the Tenant’s maintenance issues and ensure the rental unit is in a
good state of repair.
17.  
The Landlord has been absent
for over six years. There is no dispute the Tenant was last in contact with the
Landlord’s Agent in 2012 before he reappeared in October 2018.  The Landlord’s
obligations under section 20 and 29(1) was not met during this period. The
Tenant was left to fend for himself to do repairs in the rental unit. It also
caused the Tenant distress, given he was left in limbo for a quite a few years.
The Tenant is requesting that the doctrine of laches apply. 
18.  
The Landlord has a statutory
claim to arrears under the Act and there’s no statutory limitation for this
type of claim that falls under the L1 application. This is not an equity claim
that is being advanced. The Landlord’s application is based in statute under
the Act, not equity. 
19.  
The Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act') imposes limitation periods for tenant application under
29(1), as stated above. The Act also imposes limitation periods on most landlord
applications where they have 30 days from the date of the termination date on
the notice to file their application. For example, L2 application based on N8,
N12, N5, etc.
20.  
The only exception where
there is no statutory limitation period is an application filed under section
69 of the Act, or an L1 or L9 applications for arrears. The legislature clearly
set their minds to this issue and chose not to impose a limitation period. I
don’t think the doctrine of laches can be applied so as to effectively impose a
limitation period on rent arrears applications where the legislature has not
seen fit to include one. 
21.  
The Tenant has benefited
from the Landlord’s lack of due diligence in running his business because the
rent arrears above $25,000.00 is extinguished. Even if the Tenant persuades me
that a full abatement should be issued because the Landlord was absent for six
years, pursuant to section 30(1), the abatement would be capped at $25,000.00.
This amount still does not reduce the amount the Tenant owes to less than
$25,000.00. 
22.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
On March 7, 2019 between
9:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m., the Landlord shall investigate the maintenance issues
related to the roof, ceiling in the master bedroom, mold in the basement and
toilets and conduct all necessary repairs on or before March 31, 2019.
2.     
The Tenant shall not
interfere with the Landlord’s work or access to the unit.
3.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated on March 23, 2019.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before March 23, 2019.
4.     
The amount of $5,940.00 plus
accrued interest shall be paid out to the Landlord.
5.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $25,000.00*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to March 12, 2019.
6.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $48.82 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
March 13, 2019 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
7.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
8.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March 23, 2019, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from March
24, 2019 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
9.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 23, 2019, then starting March 24, 2019, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
10.  
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 24, 2019.
11.  
If, on or before March 23,
2019, the Tenant pays the amount of $25,000.00** to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
12.  
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March 24, 2019 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
13.  
The Board shall pay to the
Landlord the amount of $5,940.00 together with any accrued interest. **
