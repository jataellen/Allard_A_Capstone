Order under
Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006


 




 


File Number:
TEL-21322-22




In the matter of:


UNIT 2, 77 CELINA STREET OSHAWA ON L1H4N1


 




Between:


Ada Ianni


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Jessica McDonald


Tenant



 
On January 10, 2022, Ada Ianni
(the 'Landlord') applied in this L3 application for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jessica
McDonald (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant entered into an agreement to terminate the
tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Landlord and the Tenant signed
an N11 Agreement to End the Tenancy
form with effective
termination date January 31, 2022.
 
2.       
Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis before the termination date so that the
Landlord could secure their position (rather than after the termination date if
the Tenant failed to vacate), the costs of reimbursing the application filing fee will not be ordered on the Tenant.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 1, 2022 (standard 11 days from the
issuance date of this order).
 
2.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 1, 2022, then starting February
2, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 2, 2022.

The tenant has until January 31, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 77(6) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 31, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on August
2, 2022 if the order has not been filed
on or before this date with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the
rental unit is located.
