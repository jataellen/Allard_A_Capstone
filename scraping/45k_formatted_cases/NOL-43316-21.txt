Andrew Mishenene Theresa Mishenene


Tenants



 
 
 
Ontario Aboriginal Housing (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Andrew Mishenene and Theresa Mishenene (the 'Tenants') because the conduct of
the Tenants, another occupant of the rental unit or a person permitted in the
residential complex by the tenant is such
that it substantially interferes with the
reasonable enjoyment of the
residential complex for all usual purposes by the landlord or
another tenant or substantially interferes with another lawful right, privilege
or interest of the landlord or another tenant.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on October 25, 2021.
 
The Landlord,
represented by Angela Parenteau, and the Tenant, Andrew Mishenene, supported by Jennifer
Ealey, attended the hearing. The Tenant spoke with Tenant Duty Counsel
prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     On June 15, 2021 the Landlord served the Tenants with
an N5 notice to terminate the tenancy pursuant to subsection 64(1)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’). The Termination date in the notice is June 29, 2021.
 
2.    
At the outset of the hearing
I raised the potential issue of the N5 notice
being invalid and heard submissions from the Landlord. After considering the submissions I advised that I was dismissing the application for reasons to
follow. These are my reasons.
 
3.     Subsection 64(2) of the Act sets out the required elements
for a valid N5 Notice: 64(2) A notice of termination
under subsection (1) shall,
(a)  provide a termination date not earlier
than the 20th day after the notice
is given;
 
(b) 
set out the grounds for termination; and

(c) 
require the tenant, within seven
days, to stop the conduct or activity or correct the omission set out in the
notice.
 
4.    
Since the N5 notice was served
on June 15, 2021, the termination date in the notice is only 14 days after the notice was
served.
 
5.     I find the notice defective for not providing the
statutory 20 days notice as required by subsection 64(2)(a) of the Act. As a result,
the Landlord’s application must be dismissed.
 
6.     This order contains
all of the reasons in this matter and no further reasons
will issue.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
