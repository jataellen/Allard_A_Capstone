Dinh Dung Luong (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Radjabu Muhezagiro and Lydia Inamaharo
(the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
18, 2022. The Landlord and the
Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 31, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,550.00.
 
4.     The Tenant paid all arrears
for the period ending January
31, 2022 after the application
was filed.
 
5.     The only amount
outstanding is the Landlord's cost of filing the application. As a result, the order will be limited to
costs only and not eviction.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
