Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Mohammad
Hossein Tabatabaei Soltani Tahmineh Akbarkhanzadeh


Tenants



 
 
 
Li Cheng (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Mohammad
Hossein Tabatabaei Soltani
and Tahmineh Akbarkhanzadeh (the 'Tenants') because
the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in
the unit after the termination date.
 
This application
was heard in Passcode: 980 0061 7732# on August 5, 2021. The Landlord, represented by Yun Tao Li, and the Tenants, represented by Horia Tabatabaei Soltani, attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    A
landlord is required to pay a tenant the equivalent of one-month rent, prior to
the termination date on a notice
served to terminate
a tenancy for landlord’s own use. In this
case, the Landlord paid the Tenants this amount on June 18, 2021, prior to the
termination date on the notice, but cancelled the payment on June 21, 2021 and
did not make the payment before the termination date. As of the date of this hearing the Landlord has not paid the
Tenants the amount required. I find
the Landlord is not in compliance with the requirements under the Residential
Tenancies Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord's application is dismissed.
