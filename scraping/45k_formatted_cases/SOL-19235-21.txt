and


 




 


Frank Howell


Tenant



 
 
 
Interrent C/o Clv Group
1 (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy
and evict Frank Howell (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 8, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s legal representative, E. Jacob, and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period from December
1, 2020 to November 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a
Notice of Termination.
 
2.    
The Tenant moved out of the rental unit on November
20, 2021, and the tenancy terminated on that date.
 
3.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,555.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
4.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period
from September 2, 2020 to October 31,
2021.
 
Rent Arrears:
 
5.    
It is undisputed that the least agreement states
that the monthly
rent was $1,555.00, including parking.




 
6.     The total amount
of rent paid during the tenancy is undisputed. The Tenant disputes
the lawfulness of the monthly rent of $1,555.00, and he is therefore
seeking a rent abatement.
 
7.     However, based on a monthly
rent of $1,555.00, it is undisputed that the Tenant
owes the Landlord $13,460.57
to the last day of the tenancy, November 20, 2021.
 
Tenant’s Section
82 Claim:
 
Rental Unit not what was promised:
 
8.    
The Tenant’s claim pursuant
to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) is unusual.
 
9.     The Tenant alleges that the Landlord misrepresented
the rental unit. The Tenant’s uncontested testimony is that after extensively searching
for a new unit, and with a good
understanding of the rental market in
the area, he came, in August or September, 2020, to view a unit in one of the three buildings on the
residential complex. He said that he
was aware the unit he viewed was not the one he was going to rent.
 
10.  The Tenant said that the unit he viewed in August or September, 2020, was fully renovated, and everything was new.
 
11.  The Tenant said he communicated to the Landlord, and
he asked if there was a west- facing unit available, and the Landlord
told him there was a smaller, west-facing unit, for
$1,515.00 per month plus
electricity and parking, and the Landlord’s agent sent him photos of a similar
unit in an email, dated July 16, 2020. The
photos, submitted into evidence, showed a renovated unit with access to the
balcony from both the bedroom and the living-room. The Tenant was aware that the photos
taken were not ones of the
actual unit he would be renting, but he said he believed they depicted a
similar unit.
 
12.  The Tenant said that he came to his understanding that his own unit would be identical
to the photos sent to him on July 16, 2020, wholly through verbal
discussions with the Landlord’s agents. He
did not have any documentary evidence that the Landlord promised his unit would
be identical.
 
13.  The uncontested evidence of the Tenant was that there
was no inspection report completed upon his moving in to the rental unit. He said he was never shown the unit before moving in, and he was given
the keys on the move in day.
 
14.   The Tenant said that he was completely devastated when
he moved into his unit and discovered that his unit was unrenovated and old. He said that he made a complaint
immediately through the Landlord’s rent portal. The Tenant submitted into evidence an email dated October 27,
2020, from the Landlord’s property manager, informing the Tenant that there are units available
as of December 1, but “it would
be a new lease and higher rental rate for the fully
renovated apartments.”




 
15.  The Tenant said that negotiations afterwards led him to conclude
that he would have to pay a higher rent for a renovated unit,
and this was not satisfactory.
 
16.  The Tenant submitted into evidence photos of his
rental unit, and he compared it to the photos he was sent on July 16, 2021, and
the unit he viewed. He said that his
unit had “crappy” wooden floors that continued in the kitchen and the bathroom,
whereas the renovated units had either new wood floors, or newly tiled floors
in the bathroom and kitchen. He said his cupboards, countertops, tub, toilet,
sink, lighting, and backsplashes
were old, and they were nothing like the photos he had been shown.
 
17.  The Tenant moved in October 1, 2020, and he stopped
paying the rent in December, 2020. He said that he withheld rent to “force
the Landlord’s hand”, but he never filed
his own Tenant application. He
said that he did not believe the onus was on him to file his own application,
but rather on the Landlord to give him what he had expected, or to reduce the
rent.
 
Illegal Entry:
18.  The Tenant also alleges that there was an illegal
entry on the morning of October 1, 2021. He
said that two employees of the Landlord barged in without notice, knocked his
bike over, and “freaked” him out. He said that they refused
to leave, but he threatened to call the police, and they eventually left. The Tenant said that he had a police
incident report for the incident.
 
19.  The Tenant said that the illegal entry had a
devastating affect on him. He said
that his girlfriend was with him during
the illegal entry, and she refused to come back to his rental
unit.
 
20.  The Tenant admits
that on July 30, 2021, he gave the Landlord
a handwritten notice to
terminate on September 30, 2021. He
said that on October 1, 2021, he had not yet handed in his keys, and his car
was still parked in the lot of the residential complex.
 
Reasons and Analysis:
21.  Section 82 of the Act provides
that a tenant is permitted
to “raise any issue that could be the subject of an application made by the tenant under this
Act” if the tenant gives advance notice to the landlord
of the tenant’s intent to raise the issue at the hearing,
that the notice is given within the permitted time limits, and the
notice is in writing.
 
22.  The Tenant did not fill in a Board-issued form stating his intention to raise a section 82 issue, he did not ask for a specific
remedy nor did he quantify the abatement he was seeking, and it was unclear
exactly what issue would have been the subject of an application under the Act
if the Tenant had made such an application.
 
23.  The Tenant requested
the “maximum rent abatement” because
the rental unit he believed he contracted for in the amount
of $1,555.00 per month was not the unit he was given. He alleges that it was not worth $1,555.00 per month.




 
24.  Although the Tenant’s exact claim was not clear, I
find that the Tenant’s allegations best fit
within the context
of a T2 application about Tenant rights.
His allegation is, essentially,
that the Landlord fraudulently misrepresented the unit for which the Tenant
signed the lease agreement, and that the Landlord provided him with a different
and inferior rental unit.
 
25.  It is uncontested that the Tenant complained to the
Landlord immediately, and he was told he could
have a renovated unit for a higher rent. The Tenant
did not agree
with this response, and he
thought he should be given a renovated unit for $1,555.00 per month rent. He did not believe he should have to pay
more for a unit he believed he had been promised. Therefore, I find it
was appropriate at that stage, in October, 2020, right after he had moved in to the rental unit,
to ask for specific performance of the contract he believed he had entered. He asked for a renovated unit on the same
rental terms.
 
26.  However, once the Landlord refused to provide a
renovated unit at the same price, instead of taking steps towards any other
appropriate remedy such as rescinding the contract and moving out, the Tenant
chose to remain
in the rental unit he had been given,
and to pay no rent. He did not file a
Tenant application, and he did not claim whatever remedies might have been
available to him upon rescission of the contract. Instead, the Tenant chose to stay in the unsatisfactory rental
unit rent-free.
 
27.  The Tenant’s photos
prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the rental
unit he was given had older
floors, countertops, and cabinets than the unit he had seen in person and in
photos. I find that the correspondence
suggests that the Landlord misled the Tenant about the appearance of the rental
unit. However, the Tenant did not
provide any evidence of specific maintenance breaches by the Landlord, nor that
he was deprived of the reasonable enjoyment of living in a one bedroom rental
unit in the residential complex.
 
28.  The Tenant did not allege, nor did he provide, any
documentary evidence of a specific maintenance
issue, nor any specific interference with his reasonable enjoyment that was caused as a result
of having old appliances, floors
and countertops, other than it was not what he expected, and it was not as
aesthetically pleasing.
 
29.  Even if I were to conclude that the Tenant had proved
his allegation, that is, that he was substantially deprived of the bargain he
believed he had entered into, the Tenant did not seek the appropriate
remedy, nor did he submit
any evidence to support a claim for a rent abatement. For example, the Tenant did not have any documentary evidence of
market rents in the area, or what the rents were for comparable units. He provided no evidence upon which I could
base a determination of what rent abatement, if any, would be appropriate.
 
30.  In any case, I do not find that the Tenant has proved,
on a balance of probabilities, that he was substantially deprived of the
bargain he believed he had entered into. He
was given possession of a one bedroom rental unit that had a kitchen, bathroom,
bedroom and balcony much like what he had viewed in person and in photos. There is no allegation of anything in the unit not working
as it should. Ultimately, the Tenant’s rental




 
unit did not look as nice as the photos he had seen,
nor was it as new as the unit he had
seen in person.
 
31.  It is undisputed that the Tenant entered into a lease agreement
with the Landlord for a rental unit at a price of $1,555.00 per month including
parking. It is undisputed that the
Tenant had failed to pay $13,460.57 of what was owed by the time he
left. I find that the Tenant owes the Landlord arrears of $13,460.57.
Illegal Entry:
32.  It is now before me to determine whether the entry of the Landlord’s employees
on October 1, 2021, was illegal, and if so, what is the appropriate
remedy.
 
33.  It is undisputed that the Tenant gave the Landlord a
notice of termination, saying that he would leave on September 30, 2021. However,
it is also uncontested that the Tenant
had not given in his keys to the Landlord, and his car was still parked
in the parking lot.
 
34.  I find, based on the Tenant’s uncontested evidence, that the Landlord illegally entered the rental unit on October 1, 2021. It is true that the Tenant had given notice, and the
Tenant should have vacated the rental unit the day prior to the entry. However, the conduct described by the
Tenant suggests, on a balance of probabilities, that the Landlord knew, or
should have known, that the Tenant had not yet vacated.
 
35.  The Tenant seeks 100% rent abatement for one month,
or $1,555.00.
 
36.  Guideline 6 of the Board’s Interpretation Guidelines
states that, in determining the amount of an abatement for the violation
of a tenant’s rights, the Board will consider
factors such as the landlord’s
intentions in doing the action complained of by the tenant, whether the
landlord was motivated by malice toward the tenant, the extent of the harm
suffered as a result of the landlord’s actions, whether the tenant contributed
to or aggravated the situation, the frequency or duration of the landlord’s actions, including the
number of occasions on which the conduct occurred. The Guideline suggests that the abatement may be expressed as a
portion of the rent that would reflect the seriousness of the expected effects
on a tenant.
 
37.  The Landlord did not provide
a witness to give testimony, and therefore, there is no basis
upon which I can determine the Landlord’s intentions or motivations in entering
illegally.
 
38.  The Tenant said he was devastated and “freaked out”,
and he said that his girlfriend never returned to his rental unit. He provided no further evidence of a
lasting or continuing impact of this illegal entry. The illegal entry was a one off, and there is no indication that there
was such a pattern of conduct on the part of the Landlord. The entry
also occurred in the context of the Landlord’s legitimate, anticipated
repossession of the rental unit on that date, a unit for which over $13,000.00
of rent was owed.
 
39.  Consequently, I find that $1,000.00 abatement is a reasonable amount
that has been awarded in similar cases, and it
will be so ordered.




 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.    
The Tenant moved out of the rental unit on or before November
20, 2021, and the
tenancy terminated on that date.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $13,460.57*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to November 20, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     A further $1,000.00
shall be deducted
from the amount
owed in paragraph 2, because
of the illegal entry by the Landlord’s employees on October 1, 2021, for
a total of
$12,460.57 owing by the Tenant to the Landlord.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
26, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 27, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
