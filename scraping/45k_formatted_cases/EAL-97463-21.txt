Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-97463-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


2ND FLOOR,
95 PEEL STREET
EAST ALEXANDRIA ON K0C1A0


 




Between:


Nancy Jeaurond
  Simon Jeaurond


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Britanny Kluke
  Clovis Lacelle


Tenants



 
 
 
and Nancy
Jeaurond and Simon Jeaurond (the
'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Britanny
Kluke and Clovis Lacelle (the 'Tenants') because they, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlords or another
tenant. The Landlords
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on December 14, 2021.
 
The Landlords legal representative James Moak, the Landlord Nancy Jeaurond, the Tenants
legal representative Marie Beaupre and the Tenant Britanny Kluke attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants raised a preliminary
issue arguing that the N5 notice of termination was vague and lacked specifics, and requested that the application be dismissed per Ball v Metro Capital Properties, [2002]
O.J. No. 5931.
 
2.     The Landlord served a voidable
N5 notice of termination dated August 13, 2021 that set
out the following allegation:
 
August 14, 2021, THE TENANTS ARE
SMOKING CANNIBUS SO EXTENSIVELY IT HAS CAUSED TWO OTHER TENANTS
TO VACATE. THE SMELL OF CANNIBUS IS SO STRONG PROSEPECTIVIE PURCHASERS ARE
REFUSING TO ENTER THE UNIT. THE TENANT HAS
REFUSED TO STOP SMOKING CANNIBUS
IN THE UNIT.
 
THE TENANT MUST STOP ALL ACTIONS
THAT DISTURB THE REASONABLE ENJOYMENT OF THE LANDLORD OR OTHER TENANTS
INCLUDING BUT NOT




File Number: EAL-97463-21
 
LIMITED TO STOP SMOKING
CANNIBUS AND MUST CLEAN THE UNIT SO THAT
THE SMELL OF CANNIBUS IS NOT PRESENT.
 
3.     The Landlord submitted that the Tenant
understands the case before him as they had
provided 50 pages of documentation to the Landlord within 48 hours of receiving
the notice and indicated that they would not change their consumption patterns.
 
4.     I agreed with the Tenants submissions that the notice
is vague. Consumption of marijuana is
a lawful activity and is therefore not a valid reason by itself. The second phrase completely lacks any specifics as to what conduct the Tenants are being asked to
stop doing that disturbs the reasonable enjoyment of the Landlord or other
tenants. If it relates to the
consumption of marijuana then since that is a lawful activity, it remains vague
as to what else the Landlord might be referring to. Therefore, the Landlords application cannot proceed.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
