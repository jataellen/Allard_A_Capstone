Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-92544-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


11, 40 ROBINSON STREET NAPANEE ON K7R2R7


 




Between:


Torbill Holdings Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Cindy Gilchrist


Tenant



 
 
Torbill Holdings Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Cindy Gilchrist (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex has seriously impaired the safety of any person.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on November 24, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s agent, Tonia Wannamaker, and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
The Tenant was assisted by Samantha Hayward, Tenant
Duty Counsel.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord’s L2 application
is based on a N7 notice of termination served
to the Tenant on October 27, 2020 with termination date of November 15,
2020 pursuant to subsection 66(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 alleging
a serious impairment of safety.
 
PRELIMINARY MOTION
 
2.     At the beginning
of the hearing, the Tenant raised a preliminary motion
with respect to the
validity of the N7 notice of termination – specifically that it failed to set
out the particulars including times and details. The particulars on the notice
of termination were vague, rendering the notice of termination defective. The
Tenant seeks that the Landlord’s application be dismissed.
 
3.    
The Landlord explains that she drafted the N7 over a year ago and that the Tenant has been aware
of the issues all along;
she states that this was a learning curve for her and that it may have been a minor mistake but agrees that the details are vague.
 
ANALYSIS
 
4.     The problem
with the N7 notice of termination
is that while it selects
reason 1 as the basis for the notice of termination, it
fails to describe the problematic behaviour that resulted in




File Number: EAL-92544-20
 
a serious impairment of safety and whether the incident(s) were at the residential
premises.
 
5.     As I stated
at the hearing, the Landlord’s notice is lacking sufficient “reasons and details” as required by subsections 43(2)
and 66(2) of the Act which state:
 
43(2) If the notice is given by a landlord, it shall also set out the reasons
and details respecting the termination …
 
66 (2) A notice of termination under this section
shall provide a termination date not
earlier than the 10th day after the notice is given and shall set out the grounds for termination.
 
[Emphasis added.]
 
6.    
The need for a notice to contain
“reasons and details” was addressed by the Divisional
Court decision Ball
v. Metro Capital
Property, [2002] O.J. No. 5931. Ball v.
Metro Capital Property stands
for the proposition that the kinds of particulars that should be contained in a
notice include “dates and times of the alleged offensive conduct together with
a detailed description of the alleged conduct engaged in by the tenant”.
 
7.     While the notice of termination in Ball v. Metro
Capital Property was a N5 notice of termination and not a N7 notice
of termination as it is in this case,
the principle remains the same. The purpose of providing
these details is not only to inform a tenant but to allow them to respond to
the application.
 
8.    
The N7 notice here clearly does not provide
sufficient details. It does not indicate the time
frame when the incident(s) are estimated to take place, or the specific
behaviours that constitute a serious impairment of safety. Thus, the Landlord’s
L2 application must be dismissed.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
