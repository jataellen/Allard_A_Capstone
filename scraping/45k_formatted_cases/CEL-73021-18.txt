Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006











 
 

AC (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict FC (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Mississauga on March 7,
2018 and June 15, 2018.  
 
The Landlord and the Landlord's
Legal Representative, VM attended both hearings.  The Tenant only attended the
hearing on March 7, 2018.
 
Determinations:
 
Tenant’s adjournment request
 
1.     
This application was
scheduled to be heard on March 7, 2018. At that hearing, the Tenant requested
an adjournment.  He said that he arranged for a friend to represent him but his
friend was unavoidably detained and could not attend.  The Tenant testified
that his friend had all the documents he required to dispute the amount of rent
owing and he also testified that he intended to raise issues pursuant to
section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).
2.     
The Landlord's Legal
Representative opposed the adjournment request because of the substantial
arrears ($22,000.00).
3.     
I granted the adjournment
and the next hearing date was made peremptory on the Tenant.  In Interim Order
CEL-73021-18-IN issued on March 14, 2018 I ordered the Tenant to pay rent owing
for April, May and June 2018.  I also ordered the Tenant to provide the
Landlord with a list of issues he intended to raise at the next hearing and any
disclosure.
4.     
At the hearing on June 15,
2018, the Landlord's Legal Representative advised that the Tenant failed to
comply with the Board’s interim order.  The Tenant did not provide a list of
issues or any disclosure to the Landlord or the Landlord's Legal
Representative. The Tenant also failed to pay rent owing for April, May and
June, 2018.
5.     
On June 11, 2018, the Tenant
sent submissions to the Board requesting an adjournment because he was
celebrating Eid. 
6.     
The Landlord's Legal
Representative opposed the adjournment because the Tenant failed to comply with
the Board’s interim order and the arrears are now $27,750.00.
7.     
I did not grant the Tenant’s
adjournment request for the following reasons:
a)   
The Tenant knew about the
hearing as of approximately April 23, 2018 when he would have received the
notice of hearing.  The new hearing date was set based on an email from the
Tenant dated March 9th, 2018 in which he informed the Board that any
date in or after June 2018 would work for him;  
b)   
It can reasonably be
inferred that the Tenant would have known about Eid prior to June 11, 2018 which
is when he contacted the Board to request another adjournment;
c)   
The Tenant has failed to
comply the Board’s interim order;
d)   
The Tenant had the
opportunity to send someone to represent him which he did not do.  The
Landlord's Legal Representative submitted that the Tenant made no attempts to
contact him or the Landlord about rescheduling the hearing;
e)   
There is substantial
prejudice the grant this second adjournment request because of the substantial
rent arrears.
Rent owing
8.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from April 1, 2017 to
June 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective January 1, 2018.
9.     
The monthly rent is
$1,850.00.
10.  
I reviewed the submission from
the the Tenant with the Landlord's Legal Representative.  The submission from
the Tenant that the lease is “month to month cash rental just to let you know
it’s not right” is insufficient to disclose the issue the Tenant is raising regarding
this application about rent arrears.
11.  
The rent receipts submitted
by the Tenant pre-date the rent arrears claimed in this application in which
the Landlord claims rent owing as of April 2017.  Therefore these receipts are
not relevant.
12.  
Therefore the amount owing
to June 30, 2018 is $27,750.00.  The Board’s monetary jurisdiction is
$25,000.00 pursuant to section 207.  The Landlord waives the amount of rent
owed in excess of the Board’s monetary jurisdiction.  The $25,000 maximum does
not apply to interest and costs (Courts of Justice Act R.S.O. 1990,
section 23(1)(a)).
13.  
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,850.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
14.  
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 1, 2014 to January 1,
2018.
15.  
No circumstances were
disclosed in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act to consider relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
Costs
16.  
The Landlord's Legal
Representative requests costs for attendance at the March 7, 2018 hearing
because the Tenant has failed to comply with the Board’s interim order and
failed to disclose issues pursuant to section 82 which was part of the reason
the first adjournment request was granted.  The Landlord's Legal Representative
submitted that the amount of costs should be assessed based on my determinations.
17.  
According to the Board’s
Interpretation Guideline 3, costs
may generally be ordered where a party’s conduct in the proceeding was
unreasonable.  Generally, only fees related to time spent at the hearing by a
party’s legal representative will be allowed.
18.  
The Tenant’s conduct is
unreasonable.  His conduct caused unnecessary delay in this proceeding because
he failed to comply with the Board’s interim order regarding payment of rent
and attendance at the June 15th hearing when it was made clear to
the Tenant that attendance on June 15th was peremptory. 
19.  
The Landlord's Legal
Representative was in attendance for approximately two hours at the last
hearing and approximately 15 minutes at the hearing on June 15, 2018.  Under
these circumstances it is appropriate to order costs of $100 for the legal
costs and unnecessary attendance at the June 15th hearing.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before June 29,
2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $24,912.09*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to June 18, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $60.82 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting June
19, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $275.00 for the cost of filing the application and costs of the
Landlord’s legal representation.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 29, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June 30,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 29, 2018, then starting June 30, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 30, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before June 29,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $25,275.00** to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after June 30, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
