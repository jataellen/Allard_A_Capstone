Landlord




 


and


 




 


Brad Koebel
  Laura Mattis


Tenants



 
 
 
12542293 Canada Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Laura Mattis and Brad Koebel (the 'Tenants')
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 18, 2022.
 
Kadian Gifford, the Landlord
and owner of the company,
and the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    For the reasons
that follow, the Landlords application is dismissed.
 
2.   
The application is based on two Notices
of Termination that the Landlord
served upon the Tenant. The Landlord served the first
N5 on September 21, 2021 (the “1st N5”); it had a termination date of October 22, 2021. The Landlord served the second N5 on September 30, 2021 (the “2nd N5”); it had a termination date of October 32, 2021.
 
3.    In the 1st N5, the Landlord claims
that the Tenant,
an occupant or a guest
of the rental unit
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or a lawful right,
interest or privilege of the Landlord or another
tenant by second hand smoke from smoking in the unit September 2021.
 
4.   
In the 2nd N5, the Landlord claims that the Tenant,
an occupant or a guest of the rental unit substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or a lawful right, interest or privilege of the Landlord or another tenant by not supplying
proof of insurance.
 
5.    In Ball v. Metro Capital Property, [2002] O.J.
No. 5931, the court held that notices of termination must contain specific
details as to the behaviour complained of including dates and times of that behaviour.




File Number: TEL-20090-21
 
6.   
The references to smoking
in September 2021 does not give the Tenant sufficient detail to know the
case they have to meet. At a minimum, dates with respect to when smoking is
alleged to have interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of others
must be included
in the notice.
 
7.    The notice also alleges that the “smoking smell is
also apparent in common stairwells of the building for which smoking
is prohibited”. As above, in order for the Tenant to know the case to
meet, dates of when smoking was alleged in the stairwell are required.
 
8.   
Therefore, based on all of the above, I find that the 1st N5 notice is fatally
flawed, and the Landlord’s application must be
denied; the 1st N5 must be valid for the application
to proceed on a 2nd N5.
 
9.   
As the application is dismissed based
on the flawed 1st N5, this order does not address the October 32, 2021 date on the 2nd N5.
 
10. This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord's application is dismissed.
