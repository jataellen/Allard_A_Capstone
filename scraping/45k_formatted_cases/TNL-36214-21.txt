Bradley Mcdermid


Tenant



 
 
 
MYRT-EL-INC (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Bradley Mcdermid (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the
Board on October 18, 2021 with respect to application TNL-33167-21.
 
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.    
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order:
The Tenant’s unit was still littered with garbage, food waste, dirt
and grime on November 11, 2021 when the Landlord conducted a unit inspection.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order TNL-33167-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 31, 2022.
 
3.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 31, 2022, then starting
February 1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
