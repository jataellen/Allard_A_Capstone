Review Order
 
Brian Lafleur
and Janice Schauer
(the 'Tenants') applied
for an order determining that Vinh Thi Le (the 'Landlord'), gave a notice of
termination in bad faith.
 
This application was resolved by order EAT-88665-20 issued on July 13, 2021. On July 19, 2021, the Tenants
requested a review of the order.
The request was heard by videoconference on November 9, 2021.
Only the Tenants attended the hearing.
As of 10:04 a.m., the Landlord
was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the LTB. There was no record of a request to adjourn
the hearing. As a result, the hearing proceeded with only the Tenants’
evidence.
 
The Tenant,
Janice Schauer, testified at the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Request for Review
 
1.    
The application was originally before the LTB on July 7, 2021. Neither
the Tenants nor the Landlord attended the hearing and
the application was dismissed as abandoned.
 
2.    
The
LTB sent the Tenants the Notice of Hearing for the July 7th hearing by e-mail. The
Tenant, Janice Schauer,
testified that although
the LTB has the correct
e-mail addresses on file for
the Tenants, they did not receive the Notice of Hearing. The Tenant testified




 
that they received every other e-mail the LTB sent them. The Tenant
testified that the Tenants first became
aware that a hearing had been held when they received the order in the mail. The Tenant testified that
after receiving the order, she immediately called the
LTB to confirm
the Tenants’ e-mail
addresses on file. The Tenant testified that they also checked their e-mail junk and spam
folders and did not find the Notice of Hearing.
 
3.    
Based on the Tenants’
uncontested evidence, I find
that the Tenants
did not receive
the Notice of Hearing for the July 7th hearing. I am satisfied that the Tenants intended to
participate in that hearing. Accordingly, I am satisfied on a balance of
probabilities that the Tenants were not reasonably able to participate in the
proceedings. I granted the
Tenants’ request
to review and heard the application de novo
(from the beginning).
T5 Application
4.    
The
legal test for this application is set out in subsection 57(1)(b) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”). Based on the Tenants’ uncontested
evidence, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the
following three elements
of that test were proven:
•        
The Landlord
gave the Tenants
an N12 Notice of Termination under section 49 of the Act in bad faith.
•        
The Tenants
vacated the rental
unit as a result of the N12
Notice.
•        
No person referred to in subsection 49(1) of the Act occupied
the rental unit within a reasonable time after the Tenants
vacated the rental unit.
 
5.    
On October 1, 2019, the
Landlord gave the Tenants an N12 Notice of termination with a termination date of November
30, 2019. The N12 Notice states
that the Landlord
required vacant possession of the rental unit because the Landlord sold
the property and the purchaser intended to move in and live in the unit.
 
6.    
The Tenants
vacated the rental
unit on October 31, 2019 pursuant
to the N12 Notice. The Tenants were not planning to move out
of the unit at the time. The Tenants intended to keep living in the unit as
they were planning to retire, and they had done work on the backyard.
 
7.    
On November
3, 2019, the Tenants discovered that the Landlord
had posted the rental
unit on Kijiji, advertising it for rent. The Landlord’s name and contact
information are associated with the advertisement. There are also photographs
of the rental unit. The Landlord advertised the unit for $500.00 more in
monthly rent than the Tenants’ paid.
 
8.    
Based on the evidence
before me, I am satisfied on a balance
of probabilities that the
Landlord gave the Tenants the N12 Notice in bad faith.




 
Remedies
 
Rent abatement
 
9.    
The Tenants are
entitled to a rent abatement of $1,554.00. The Tenant testified that the
Tenants experienced extreme stress after they received the N12 Notice and this
manifested in health problems for them. I am satisfied that the Landlord’s act of giving the Tenants the N12 Notice substantially
interfered with their reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit during the last
month of the tenancy. Therefore, the Tenants are entitled to a 100% rent
abatement for that month.
 
Fine
 
10.  The Tenants asked that the Landlord be required to pay
“the maximum fine”. The Tenant testified that the Landlord rents
out another unit and he should be prevented from pursuing bad faith evictions
for all his properties in the future.
 
11.  The purpose of a fine is described in the LTB’s
Interpretation Guideline 16: Administrative Fines:
 
An
administrative fine is a remedy to be used by the Board to encourage compliance
with the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the "RTA"), and to deter
landlords from engaging in similar
activity in the future. This remedy is not normally imposed unless a landlord has
shown a blatant disregard for the RTA and other
remedies will not provide adequate deterrence and compliance.
 
12.  In the circumstances, having regard
to the fact that the Landlord
did not participated in these
proceeding, the impact of the Landlord’s actions on the Tenants as well as my
experience with similar
cases, I find it appropriate to order the Landlord to pay
a fine of
$2,000.00.
 
Difference in rent
 
13.  The Landlord must pay the Tenants $1,925.04
for the increased rent that the Tenants incurred for a one-year
period after they moved out of the rental unit. After the Tenants
vacated the rental unit, they moved into another unit close-by. The Tenants
paid
$1,587.58
($1,554.00 + $33.58 for gas tank rental) in monthly rent for the rental
unit. The Tenants paid
$1,748.00 ($1,695.00 + $53.00 for gas tank rental) in monthly rent for their
new unit, for an increase of $160.42 per month. The Tenant testified that both
units are townhouses. The new unit was a bit smaller; it had one less bedroom
and no backyard, but the units were otherwise comparable.
 
Moving expenses
 
14.  The Landlord must pay the Tenants $323.21
for the reasonable out-of-pocket moving, storage and other like expenses that
the Tenants incurred as a result of having to move out of the rental
unit. This includes $91.98
for a U-Haul rental;
$80.34 for boxes and other moving supplies; and $92.64 for gas
they purchased to use a friend’s truck. The Tenants




 
also requested
the cost of food they purchased for friends who helped them with the move.
However, I find that these expenses would have been voluntarily incurred and
not necessary charged to them. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to pass
these expenses on to the Landlord. The Tenants incurred fees to set up a new
gas account ($28.25) and water account ($30.00) when they moved into their new
unit. These amounts are also included in the moving expenses awarded,
since they are direct results of the Tenants having to move out
of the rental unit due to the N12 Notice.
 
15.  The Tenants also requested the following additional remedies, which were denied:
 
•        
The Tenants
claimed interest owing on their last month’s
rent deposit. However,
a T1 Application is the appropriate form to pursue
this claim, not at T5 Application. Section 185 of the Act states that an
application shall be filed with the LTB in the form approved by the Board.
•        
The Tenants claim the
cost of a veterinary services that they incurred because their dog got into one
of their moving boxes, ingested medication and had to have its stomach pumped.
I find that this cost to too remote from the Landlord’s action of giving
the Tenants the N12 Notice.
Therefore, the Landlord
cannot reasonably be held
responsible for this expense.
•        
The “lost value” of
furniture and other items the Tenants claim they had to sell cheap and get rid of due to their new unit being
small. The Tenants did not provide
evidence to substantiate the original cost of these items and when they
were purchased. Therefore, I cannot assess the age and depreciation of these
items to determine whether the amounts claimed are reasonable. In addition, I
find it difficult to reconcile this claim with the Tenants’ evidence that the
rental unit and their new unit were comparable other than the new unit having one
less bedroom and no backyard. Similarly, The Tenants claimed the difference in
cost between the larger dining table that they had recently purchased
and the smaller dining table that they were forced to
purchase to accommodate the size of their new unit. Without any supporting
documentary evidence, I find it difficult to reconcile why the Tenants had to
pay more for a smaller table.
•        
The Tenants
claimed the cost of takeout
food that they purchased for two weeks due
to the move and not having access to a stove. However, it is unclear from the
evidence why the Tenants were forced
to incur this expense when there was no gap
in time between their tenancies in the rental unit and their new unit.
•        
The Tenants claimed
money for the time they had to take off
work for the move based on their
hourly wages. However, the Tenants also acknowledged that they used vacation days for the time they took off work. Therefore, I do not consider
this to be an
out-of-pocket of expense that the Tenants incurred and that the Landlord should
be responsible for paying.
•        
The costs
associated with preparing
this application and preparing for the hearing.
In general, a party will not be responsible for paying another party’s
costs beyond the application filing fee, unless it is determined that the party acted unreasonably in the proceedings
(See Rule 23 of the LTB’s Rules of Procedure). In
this case, there is no evidence
before me to establish that this was the case. The Landlord did not attend
either hearing but I am not
satisfied that this is considered unreasonable conduct for the purpose of Rule
23.
