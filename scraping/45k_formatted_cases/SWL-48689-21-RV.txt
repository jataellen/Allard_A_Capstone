Review Order
 
Global
Properties Limited and Sunnydale
Holdings Limited C/o Artisan Corp
(the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Rosa Marin (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved by order SWL-48689-21 issued on October
19, 2021.
 
On November 16, 2021, the Tenant requested a review of the order alleging
the order contains a serious error with respect
the calculations in the
N4 Notice of Termination, L1 application and the order itself
 
On November 23, 2021,
the Board issued interim order SWL-48689-21-RV-IN staying
the order issued October 19,
2021.
 
The Tenant’s request was heard by
way of video conference on January 28, 2022. The Landlord’s Agent, Stephanie Kelly,
the Landlord’s Representative, Nathan Chang, the Tenant, the Tenant’s daughter, Aline Blanco and
the Tenant’s Legal Representative, Kristen Thompson attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Tenant’s Request to Review
 
1.       
The Tenant’s Representative
submitted that the calculations in the N4 Notice of Termination are incorrect,
because the Landlord indicated the wrong amount for the monthly rent. The Landlord
calculated the monthly
rent since 2018 with lawful
annual rent increases. The Tenant’s Representative entered in
evidence emails between the Landlord’s property manager and the Tenant’s
housing subsidy program confirming the




File Number: SWL-48689-21-RV
 
monthly rent has never been increased
since the Tenant moved into the rental unit. One of the emails
dated November 12, 2021 from the property manager to the housing subsidy
program clearly states that there have been no rent increases and the monthly
rent is $1,299.00.
 
2.       
The Landlord’s Representative is
the former owner of the rental property. As part of the purchase of sale, he
now represents the Landlord for all matters before the Board. The Landlord’s Representative testified that the monthly rent was subject
to lawful yearly
rent increases for which he served to the Tenant himself
by placing them in the mailbox. The Landlord’s Representative had no
evidence in support of his position.
 
Findings
 
3.       
On a balance of probabilities, I
am satisfied that the order contains a serious error in the calculations of
arrears of rent which stem from the Landlord’s incorrect calculations on the N4
Notice of Termination. In making this
finding, I considered the compelling evidence of the Tenant, which was not
reasonably challenged by the Landlord’s Representative, that the monthly rent
never increased during the tenancy. The Tenant’s evidence on this issue is well supported by the email of November
12, 2021 between
the Landlord’s property manager and the housing subsidy program which
confirms the monthly rent never
increased and remained
$1,299.00, being the same amount
since the tenancy began in
2018.
 
4.       
Given my finding above,
the Tenant’s request
for review is granted.
 
New Hearing of Landlord’s L1 Application
 
5.       
The Landlord’s Representative sought the consent
of the Board to withdraw
the application. I consented to
this request.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The Tenant’s request for review is granted.
 
2.       
Order SWL-48689-21 issued on October 19, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the
following:
 
3.       
The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
