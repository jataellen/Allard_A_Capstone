Order under Sections 30 and 31
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOT-38284-19
 
 
BH (the 'Tenant') applied for an
order determining that RVPI, JD and (‘HD’) (the 'Landlords') failed to meet the
Landlords' maintenance obligations under the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), that the Landlords
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or
residential complex by them and that the Landlords withheld or deliberately interfered
with the reasonable supply of a vital service that the Landlords are obligated
to supply under the tenancy agreement.
 
This application was heard on
June 17, 2021 in VC75 and on July 22, 2021 in Passcode 215 965 491 VC 75. The Tenant, the Tenant’s representative,
(‘AB-S’), and the Landlord HD attended
the hearing on June 17, 2021. Ond only the Tenant’s representative, AB-S, attended the hearing on July 22, 2021.
 
This application is one of 16
related tenant applications against the Landlords concerning the effective shut down of a mobile
home park (the ‘Park’)
and certain maintenance and repair issues leading up to the time of the
effective shut down.
 
Refer to order NOT-33990-18-HR (the ‘Base Order’)
issued February 1, 2022, concurrently with this and the other 14 related individual Tenant
applications. That order sets out my
determinations on the liability of the Landlords pertaining to events
leading up to the Park’s closure and the availability of
remedies related to the closure itself.
 
The application under file number NOT-33990-18 was a multi-tenant T2 application brought on behalf
of fifteen tenants
identified in Schedule
1 to that order (‘Park
Tenants’), seeking relief
for the discontinuance of power to the Park. A separate T6 application and/or T2 application was brought by
each of the fifteen Park Tenants, seeking relief for the Landlords’ actions and
inactions pertaining to the Park’s water supply, the Park’s sewage system and
the effective closure of the Park. This application under file NOT-38284-19 is
one of those applications.




 
The hearing of issues common to
all of the applications, meaning common to the application under file number NOT-33990-18 and the fifteen
individual applications, proceeded to completion on
July 22, 2022 in Passcode 215 965 491 VC 75 following a number of earlier
appearances.
The hearing of the Tenant’s individual issues under file number NOT-38284-19 proceeded on June
17, 2019. The procedural history is set out in the Base Order.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
As set out in the Base Order, I find that that:
 
a)     The Landlords withheld
or interfered with the provision
of electricity, a vital service;
 
b)     The Landlords failed
to repair or maintain the Park’s sewage
system, allowing problems
with sewage discharges and significant odours over a period that extends back
prior to one year prior to the Tenant’s application filing in October 2019;
 
c)     
The Landlords failed to repair or maintain the Park’s water
system such that the supply of potable water was compromised
for roughly two weeks at the beginning of March 2018 and throughout the period
June through October 2018;
 
d)     The Landlords’ failures
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the units and the Park by the Tenants,
both prior to and after October 2018; and
 
e)     The above failures, combined with the Landlords’
decision to cease providing all services at the Park as of October
2018, attract various
remedies, some pertaining to events leading up to the October 2018 effective closure and
pertaining to events following that effective closure.
 
2.   
The Tenant claims remedies
attributable to the Park’s closure.
 
3.    I find the following facts on the basis of the uncontroverted testimony of the Tenant and, where indicated, my review of
materials provided at Tab P of the Tenant’s productions;
 
a)    
The Tenant lived at the Park for 25 years many years before
he vacated in December 2019, more than a year after
the Park effectively closed in October 2018;
 
b)     The Tenant incurred
the following out of pocket expenses during his stay at the Park
following the October 2018 closure:
 
(i)                
$553.67 for a generator (refer Tab P-2);
 
(ii)               
$200.00 per month for fuel for the generator
(refer Tab P-2 for receipts
for a portion of this claim);
and
 
(iii)             
$200.00 contribution to the costs of plowing the lower portion
of the Park.
 
c)     
The Tenant suffered a loss of $20,000.00 in the value of his trailer.




 
 
 
 
4.   
As set out in the
Base Order I find the following:
 
a)     The Tenant is not entitled
to compensation for the loss of value of the mobile home;
 
b)     The Tenant is entitled to compensation for his reasonable out of pocket
expenses during his continued stay at the Park up to the end of July
2019; and
 
c)     
The Tenant may be entitled to damages for interference with reasonable enjoyment.
 
5.   
The Tenant is entitled
to compensation for some, but not all, of his out of pocket expenses during his continued stay at the
Park, up to July 31, 201 as follows:
 
(i)                
The Tenant is entitled
to $553.67 for the cost of a generator; and
 
(ii)               
The Tenant is entitled to
compensation for the reasonable costs of fuel for the generator. The Tenant testified that he incurred
$200.00 per month but made no allowance for the variance in costs between
the winter and summer months.
Tab P- 2 contains receipts for
fuel totalling roughly $515.00. The
Tenant testified that he lost a lot of his receipts. I find that it is more likely
than not that an estimate of
$200.00 per month for each of the months
from November 2018 to
July 2019 is an overstatement. I find a fuel estimate for the 9 month
period of $800.00 to be reasonable and find that the Tenant is entitled to that
compensation; and
 
(iii)             
The Tenant is entitled
to $200.00 for his out of pocket contribution to snow removal.
 
6.   
I
find that the Tenant is entitled to damages for interference with reasonable enjoyment. I find that it is likely that the Tenant suffered difficulties
during the time he stayed at the Park, particularly over the winter months. I find that a damages award of $1,000.00
is appropriate in the circumstances.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlords shall pay to the Tenant a total of $2,553.67, representing payment for the following:
 
a)     $1,353.67 for out of pocket expenses from November 2018 through July 2019;
 
b)     $200.00 for cost of snow removal; and
 
c)     
$1,000.00 for damages.
 
2.    
The Landlords shall pay the Tenant the full amount owing by March 31, 2022.




 
3.    
If the Landlords do not pay the
Tenant the full amount owing by March 31, 2022 the Landlords will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from April 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
