Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number:
TEL-21330-22
 



In the matter
of:


14, 1525 RITSON
ROAD S OSHAWA, ON L1J 3M3


 




Between:


Durham Regional Local Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Tammy Foley


Tenant



 
 
On January 11, 2022, Durham
Regional Local Housing Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied in this L4
application for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tammy Foley (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have
the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant
owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified
in the consent order issued by
the Board on October 12, 2021 with respect to L1 application TEL-19054-21.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The previous consent order
contained a provision that the
Landlord may apply to the Board under section 78 for an eviction order
without notice to the Tenant if certain conditions are not met
from the consent order.
 
2.       
In the Declaration to the L4 application, the Landlord claimed
that the Tenant breached the previous consent
order by failing to pay $356.20 on or before September 23, 2021. While this was a breach
of paragraph 2 of the consent order, this L4 application was
not filed within 30 days of the breach.
 
3.       
As per section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), the L4 application must be made within 30
days of the breach. Since this L4
application was filed on January
11, 2022 beyond 30 days of the breach, no remedy under section 78 may be
ordered.
 
4.       
The Landlord further claimed in
the Declaration to the L4 application that rent has not been paid from October
1st to
January 31, 2022. The previous consent order did not contain any condition that
rent be paid on an ongoing basis. The consent
order only contained a repayment plan for the arrears up to September 30, 2021 and the filing fee from
the L1 application. Therefore, any
alleged breach of ongoing rent is not subject to section 78 and no remedy may
be ordered.




 
It is ordered
that:
 
5.       
The Landlord’s L4 application is dismissed.
 
6.       
The previous consent order TEL-19054.21 remains
in effect.
