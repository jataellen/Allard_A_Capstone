Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: SOL-76001-16











 
 

BB and JB1 (the 'Landlords') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict JB2 and CB (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
The Tenants raised maintenance issues
pursuant to section 82 of the Act.
 
This application was heard in Brantford on
November 23, 2016.  The Landlords and the Tenant, CB,
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants did not pay the total rent they were
required to pay for the period from August 1, 2016 to January 31, 2017. 
Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective
October 21, 2016.
2.     As of the date of the hearing of this
application, the Tenants remained in possession of the rental unit and had paid
$875.00 after the application was filed.  Since the hearing, rent has come due
for the months of December, 2016, and January, 2017.
3.     The female Tenant raised maintenance issues,
pursuant to section 82 of the Act.  In particular she alleged that there has
been an unresolved bed bug infestation, and a general failure on the part of
the Landlords to repair problems in the rental unit, including a gas leak.  She
recalled that the Tenants eventually offered to do the repairs personally. 
Ultimately, they withheld rent in response.
4.     The Landlords asserted that they addressed
maintenance issues as they became aware of them, including ordering bed bug treatment. 
However, they find accessing the rental unit difficult due to a multitude of
pets, and refusals of entry by the Tenants.
5.     Having considered the evidence, I am not
satisfied that the Tenants proved that the Landlords have breached their
maintenance obligations.  The key failing was the lack of clear evidence of
timing of their reports of maintenance issues to the Landlords.
6.     Ultimately, the rent is owed.  The Tenants have
no legal right to withhold it.
7.     Given that the rent was unilaterally withheld,
and the length of time since the hearing, I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out
below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants is terminated.  The
Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before January 15, 2017.
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords
$3,186.86*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to
January 4, 2017.
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords
$28.77 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 5,
2017 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords
$170.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing* on or before January 15, 2017, the Tenants will start to owe interest. 
This will be simple interest calculated from January 16, 2017 at 2.00% annually
on the balance outstanding.
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before January
15, 2017, then starting January 16, 2017, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
7.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlords, on or after January 16, 2017.
8.     If, on or before January 15, 2017, the Tenants
pay the amount of $4,095.00** to the Landlords or to the Board in trust, this
order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy would not be
terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If this payment is not made
in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January 16, 2017 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenants are only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlords.
