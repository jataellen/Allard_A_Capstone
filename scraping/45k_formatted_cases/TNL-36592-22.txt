Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-36592-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


2 UPPER FLOORS,
148 ESTHER CRESCENT THORNHILL ON L4J3L4


 




Between:


Dov Zupnik Tehila Lea
Zupnik


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Alan Ferman


Tenant



 
 
 
Dov Zupnik and Tehila Lea Zupnik (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Alan Ferman (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant entered
into an agreement to terminate the
tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlords and the Tenant signed an agreement to terminate the tenancy as of June 30, 2022.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before June 30, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 30, 2022, then starting July 1, 2022,
the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after July 1, 2022.
