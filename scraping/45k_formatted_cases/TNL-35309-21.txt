Toronto Community Housing

Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
video conference on January

Only the Landlord's Legal
Representative, Rahel Abera, attended the hearing. As of 3:54 p.m. the Tenant was not present or represented
at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the
Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
October 1, 2018 to October 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August
16, 2019.
 
2.     
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on October
31, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.

The lawful monthly rent was $319.00.
4.     
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
5.     
The Tenant paid $319.00
after the application was filed.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     
The tenancy is terminated as of October
31, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,030.00*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to October 31, 2021.

the full amount
owing* on or before
