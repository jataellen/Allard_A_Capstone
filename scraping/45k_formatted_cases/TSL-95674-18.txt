Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-95674-18
 










 
 

S.K
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict N.G
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on June 4, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative N.M and the Tenant attended the
hearing.
Reasons:
Adjournment request
1.   
At the start of the hearing, the Tenant asked that the matter be
adjourned.  He wishes to bring a counter-claim pursuant to section 82 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘RTA’).  He says that he only recently received
notice of this proceeding, and has not had the opportunity to prepare his
section 82 counter-claim.
2.   
I denied the adjournment request.  Although section 82 permits a tenant
to bring a counter-claim, it is incumbent on the tenant to come to the hearing
prepared to do so.  The Landlord has a legitimate and time-sensitive claim for
ongoing rent arrears, and it would not be fair to delay the hearing of that
claim to give the Tenant more time to bring his own claims about other issues.
3.   
Even if the Tenant only found out about the hearing recently, I do not
find that to be a reason to give him more time to prepare a counter-claim.  The
Tenant’s complaints have been ongoing.  He could, at any time over the past
several months, have filed his own application against the Landlord.  It would
not be fair for him to now delay the Landlord’s application so as to raise
claims that he has failed to raise by way of his own application.
Rent deposit and arrears
4.   
The parties have a dispute about whether the Tenant has a rent deposit. 
The Landlord says that the Tenant had a deposit, but used it up by applying it
to the rent for a month in 2017.  The Tenant denies this.
5.   
The Landlord’s argument cannot succeed in light of subsection 106(10) of
the RTA, which provides that a rent deposit can only be applied to the last
month of a tenancy.  This tenancy has not ended, so the deposit could not be
applied to a month in 2017.  Even if the parties agreed to apply the deposit,
the agreement would have no effect since subsection 3(1) provides that the RTA
applies despite any agreement to the contrary.
6.   
In other words, on the facts the Landlord alleges, the Tenant would
still have a rent deposit, but he would owe an extra month’s arrears that arose
in 2017.  This would mean that the N4 notice of termination that the Landlord
served was invalid.  Subsection 59(2) provides that the N4 must set out the
amount of rent due, and the amount the Landlord set out in the N4 did not
include the arrears owing from 2017.
7.   
After I made that finding, the Landlord opted to waive her claim to any
arrears that may have come due in 2017, so as to preserve the validity of the
N4 notice.
8.   
The parties agree that $7,500.00 in arrears have come due in 2018. 
Those arrears are correctly set out in the N4.  I therefore find that:
a.   
the Tenant has a rent deposit of $1,875.00;
b.   
the Tenant owes rent arrears of $7,500.00 to June 30, 2018.  The
Landlord has waived her claim to any additional arrears that may have been
owing; and
c.   
the Landlord has served a valid N4 notice of termination.
Relief from eviction
9.   
The Tenant asks to repay his arrears at a rate of $700.00
monthly.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the RTA, and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the RTA on
the terms the Tenant proposes.
10. The
Tenant has not adequately explained why his arrears arose.  He gave conflicting
reasons for having failed to pay any rent from March, 2018 onwards.  At various
points, he said that he did not pay because he did not know whether he was going
to be evicted; that he refused to pay until the Landlord resolved complaints
that he had; and that he was not able to pay because his roommate had moved
out.
11. The
problem with the first two reasons is that they do not explain why the Tenant
is not now able to pay his arrears.  If he withheld payment because he was
worried about being evicted, or because of a dispute with the Landlord, then he
should now be able to make the payment.  He has not explained what happened to
the $7,500.00 that he withheld.
12. The
third reason could provide some explanation for the arrears, but it does not
explain why nothing at all has been paid for four months.  The Tenant has not
paid either his or his former roommate’s portion of the rent.  Again, if he
withheld his portion of it, he has not explained why the money is not now
available to put towards his arrears.
13. In
light of the Tenant’s contradictory and unsatisfactory explanations for his
arrears, an eleven-month payment plan would be unreasonably long.  I find that
it would be unfair to the Landlord to allow it.  A standard order will issue
terminating the tenancy unless the full amount owing is paid in eleven days.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before June 17, 2018.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4,115.11*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to June 6, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $61.64 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting June 7, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June
17, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from June 18, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before June 17, 2018, then starting June 18,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 18, 2018.
8.      If,
on or before June 17, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $7,690.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after June 18, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
