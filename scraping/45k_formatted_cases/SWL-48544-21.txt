Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-48544-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


316, 445 GLENGARRY AVENUE WINDSOR ON N9A1P7


 




Between:


Windsor Essex Community Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and
 
Jeffery Harris


 
 
Tenant



 
 
 
Windsor Essex
Community Housing Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jeffery
Harris (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit
or a person the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has seriously
impaired the safety of any person. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on December 6, 2021.
 
On the Landlord's Legal Representative, Cameron
Parrott, and the Landlord’s district
manager, T. Mokhtari (‘TM’),
attended the hearing. As of 10:28 a.m., the Tenant was not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
On December 29, 2020,
the Landlord conducted an inspection of the rental unit and noticed that the
Tenant had tampered with the smoke detector by placing tape over it, rendering
it inoperable. This has seriously impaired the safety of other persons and this
act or omission occurred in the residential complex. I say this because the
smoke detector is connected to the fire panel for the entire residential complex.
Had there been a fire in the rental unit, it would
not have been reported to the central fire panel. The Tenant created risk of
serious injury to himself and other tenants of the residential complex.
 
2.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenant was not present to request
relief and the Landlord was not aware of any circumstances to grant relief.
 
It is ordered that:




File Number: SWL-48544-21
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
January 24, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 24, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before January 24, 2022, the Tenant will start
to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 25, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
4.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 24, 2022, then starting January 25, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
5.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after January 25, 2022.
