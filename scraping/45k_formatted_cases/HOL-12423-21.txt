Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number: HOL-12423-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
2400 DRESS
CIRCLE CRESCENT OSHAWA ON
  L1L0L9


 




Between:


Kevin
  Ng


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jin Wang


Tenant



 
 
 
Kevin Ng (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jin Wang (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 1, 2022. Only the Landlord and the Landlord's Legal
Representative, Yigal Rifkind, attended the hearing. As of 3:15 p.m., the
Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
February 1, 2020 to February 28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October
25, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $3,000.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
6.     The Board’s monetary jurisdiction is $35,000. At the
commencement of the hearing I asked whether the Landlord is aware of this limit
and if the excess owed is waived.
The Landlord confirmed that the excess owed to the Landlord is being
waived.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the




 
Tenant, and find that it would
be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 18, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$35,000.00*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 7, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
18, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 19, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 18, 2022, then starting
February 19, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 19, 2022.
 
7.    
If, on or before February 18,
2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $67,986.00** to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 19, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
