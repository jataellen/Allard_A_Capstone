Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-07557-18



 


 


 



 
 
RM
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict SBO
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (L1
application).
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because he has been persistently late in paying his rent. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after
the termination date (L2 application).
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on October 12, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord’s representative, IG, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from July 1, 2018 to October 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 30, 2018.
 
2.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $979.10 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
3.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from March 1, 2018 to
September 30, 2018.
 
4.      The
Tenant paid $2,400.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
L1
application
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before October 26, 2018.
 
2.      As
of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation
the Landlord is entitled to by $2,067.40*.
 
3.      However,
the Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the
Landlord owes the Tenant:
$32.19 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting October 16,
2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit, and
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.      The
Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as
a result of this order.
 
5.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before October 26, 2018, then starting October
27, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after October 27,
2018.
 
7.      If,
on or before October 26, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $1,566.49** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after October 27, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
L2
application
9.      If
the Tenant voids the eviction order pursuant to paragraph 7 or 8 of the order,
then for the 12-month period commencing on November 1, 2018, and ending on
October 1, 2019, the Tenant shall pay the rent on or before the first day of
each month.
10.   Section
78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 applies to paragraphs 9 of
this order. If the Tenant fails to pay make any payment, the Landlord may,
without notice to the Tenant, apply to the Board for an order terminating the
tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord must make this application no
later than 30 days after the Tenant fails to make a payment
