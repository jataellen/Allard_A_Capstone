Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-96509-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


438 GLADSTONE RUE HAWKESBURY ON K6A2H1


 




Between:


Alain Lacelle


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Alexandra Goyer Joey Laughren Noël Lalonde


Tenants



 
 
 
Alain Lacelle
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Noël
Lalonde, Joey Laughren and Alexandra
Goyer (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on November 25, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord attended
the hearing. As of 9:39 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly notified of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were
required to pay for the period from May 1, 2021 to November
30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective June 24, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant
is in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The monthly
rent is $282.00.
 
4.    
The Tenants
paid $846.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Tenant should
be aware that all of the rent and arrears
payments due dates are
all “on or before” the date specified meaning that the Tenant must make sure
that these payments are made by that date. The Tenant must also make sure that
the payments are made in full by the due date. If the Tenant is late with a
payment, does not make a payment or only makes a partial payment the Landlord
can file paperwork with the Board that, if correct, would result in an order
for eviction. If




 
there may be an issue,
the Tenant is encouraged to contact the Landlord prior
to the default.
 
6.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from
eviction subject to the condition(s)
set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$1,399.00 which represents the amount of rent
owing and costs ($186.00) outstanding for the period ending January 2022.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s application for eviction
of the Tenants is denied
on the condition that:
(a)  The Tenants shall make the following
payments to the Landlord in respect of the
monies owing under paragraph 1 of this order:
 



Date Payment Due


Amount
of Payment




On or before December 1, 2021


$282.00




On or before January 1, 2022


$282.00




On or before January 15,
2022


$139.00




On or before February 15,
2022


$139.00




On or before
March 15, 2022


$139.00




On or before
April 15, 2022


$139.00




On or before
May 15, 2022


$139.00




On or before
June 15, 2022


$140.00



 
(b)  The Tenants shall also pay the Landlord the rent for the months
of February 2022 to
June 2022, and no later than the 1th day of each corresponding month.
 
3.    
If the Tenants fails
to make any of the payments in accordance with paragraph 2, excluding the costs, and by the dates
required, then:
 
(a)  The Landlord may apply
under section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants, and for the payment of any new arrears of rent and NSF
charges not already
ordered under paragraph
1 of this order. The Landlord must




 
make the application within 30 days of a breach of a condition
set out in paragraph 2 of this order.
 
(b)  The balance owing under paragraph 1 of this order shall become payable
on the day following the date of default. The monies owing shall bear
interest at the post- judgment interest rate determined under subsection 207(7)
of the Act.
