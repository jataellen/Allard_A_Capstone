Order under Section 21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-89992-17-RV
 










 
 

Review Order
 
R.
H. and A. N. (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict N. D. and R. E. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the
rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This
application was resolved by order TSL-89992-17 issued on December 4, 2017.
 
On
January 4, 2018, the Tenants requested a review of the order.
 
The
request was heard in Whitby on January 17, 2018. 
 
The Landlords, the Landlords’ representative, A. H., and the
Tenants attended the hearing. 
 
Determinations:
 
The Review Request
 
1.      The
Tenants say that they were not reasonably able to participate in the hearing
that took place on December 1, 2017, because they did not receive the notice of
hearing. They say they have reason to believe the Landlords have tampered with
their mail and withheld the notice of hearing from them. They say that the
Landlords have tampered with their mail in the past. 
2.      The
Landlords say they have never tampered with the Tenants’ mail and they did not
take the notice of hearing. 
3.      Based
on the evidence before me, while I am not satisfied that the Landlords tampered
with the Tenants’ mail, I am satisfied that the Tenants did not receive the
notice of hearing for some reason. I am also satisfied that they genuinely
intended to participate in the December 1, 2017, hearing and were not
reasonably able to do so. As a result, I granted the Tenants’ request for
review. 
The
Application for Non-Payment of Rent
4.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from August 6, 2017 to January 5, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlords
served a Notice of Termination effective October 26, 2017.
5.      The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending January 31, 2018, total $14,700.00.
6.      The
Landlord incurred costs as a result of filing the application in the amount of
$190.00 and is entitled to reimbursement for those costs. 
7.      The
Landlords collected a rent deposit of $2,450.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlords.
8.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from June 4, 2016 to
October 26, 2017, in the amount of $51.46.
9.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). 
10.   In
particular, I have considered that, based on their monthly income and expenses,
the Tenants cannot afford the monthly rent as well as their monthly bills. In
fact, it appears that the Tenants have not been able to afford the rental unit
for quite some time and have not made any payments towards the rent since
August 2017. 
11.   The
arrears are now quite substantial and have put the Landlords in a precarious
financial position. The Landlords are living in a 2 bedroom apartment along
with their two children, ages 4 and 1 ½ years old, and 4 other relatives. The
Landlords’ children are sleeping on the floor and the youngest child has a
congenital heart problem that requires constant care and medical attention. The
child is not able to properly recover due to their cramped living conditions. 
12.   The
Tenants are living with their 10 year old son and their 25 year old son in the
rental unit which is a 4 bedroom house. The Tenants are seeking relief from
eviction in the form of delay until February 28, 2018. However, the Tenants’
financial situation is bleak and is not set to improve in the foreseeable
future. The Tenants have been aware of this impending eviction since they were
served with the notice of termination in October 2017. Due to the extensive
amount of time that has passed and the substantial arrears, and the
circumstances of both the parties, I find that it would be unfair to grant the
Tenants any kind of relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It
is ordered that:
1.      Order
TSL-89992-17 issued on December 1, 2017 is cancelled and replaced by the
following: 
2.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before January 30, 2018.
3.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $9,245.29*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to January 19, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $80.55 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting January 20, 2018 to the date they move out of the
unit.
5.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before January 30, 2018, then starting January
31, 2018, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after January 31,
2018.
8.      If,
on or before January 30, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $14,890.00** to
the Landlords or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after January 31, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlords. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
