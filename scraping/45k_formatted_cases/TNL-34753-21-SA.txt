In the matter
of:


82 SIR SANFORD FLEMING WAY MAPLE ON
  L6A0V3


 




Between:


Sara Tsimerman


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Dolorita Mckie William Solomon


Tenants



 
 
 
 
Sara Tsimerman
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Dolorita Mckie and William
Solomon (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they
owe because the Tenants failed to meet a
condition specified in the order issued by the Board on July
19, 2021 with respect to application TNL-31021-21.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved
by order TNL-34753-21, issued on October
12, 2021. The Tenants filed a
motion to set aside order TNL-34753-21.
 
This motion
was heard by video conference on December 14, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s legal representative, N. Korenberg, and the Tenant,
D. McKie attended
the hearing. The Tenants spoke
to Tenant Duty Counsel, B.
Kukulewich, prior to the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.    
The Landlord
alleges that the Tenants did not pay $10,000.00 on or before
August 15, 2021, thereby
breaching order TNL-31021-21, issued on July 19, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant,
D. McKie (DM) admits that the Tenants
failed to pay $10,000.00 on or before August 15, 2021.
 
3.    
DM said that she made every effort to pay the $10,000.00, and she had been expecting a cheque for work completed by the Tenants, but it did not
materialize. She admits that she
consented to pay it, and she had every reason to believe that she would be able
to make the payment on time. DM said
that the Tenants have paid over $12,000.00 of the over $17,000.00 of arrears
that were owed in July, 2021.




 
 
 
4.    
DM said that during
Covid she had to pivot from
being a legal secretary to starting up her
own business. She said that she now
runs a renovation business with her husband.
 
5.    
DM said that the business is running well, and the Tenants could have
the full amount of arrears owed, as well as the rent, paid by March 15, 2022. She said that they have kept to the payment plan in every other
payment, and they have sometimes overpaid or paid early.
 
6.    
DM said that she lives in the rental
unit with her husband and four teenage
children. She said that the
Tenants would like to remain in the rental unit because of the proximity to the
children’s schools, and the availability of special needs services for her son.
 
7.    
DM said that the business has an average
monthly income of $6,885.00, and her
husband earns an additional $5,000.00 per month.
 
8.    
The Landlord
submits that the Tenants consented to a payment
plan that they breached.
The Landlord submits that she gave the Tenants an opportunity to pay the
arrears with the payment plan, and the Landlord now requests eviction.
 
9.    
The Tenants
submits that they can catch up completely by March 15, 2022, and they
have a consistent income that will permit them to fully reimburse the Landlord.
 
10.  I find that, although the Tenants breached
the payment plan order of July, 2021, they have kept up with all the other
payments, and they have at times overpaid what was agreed. The Tenants’ recent payment history
suggests, on a balance of probabilities, that they now have a consistent and
sufficient income to pay the rent going forward. They have also said that they would be able to pay up the arrears
owed in full by March 15, 2022.
 
11.  Having considered all the circumstances
pursuant to section 78(11) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’), I find, that it would not be unfair to set aside the eviction order if
the Landlord can be made whole. The
Tenants are established in the rental unit, and they have demonstrated a good
faith intention to maintain the tenancy in good faith with consistent payment
of the rent, as well as payments towards the arrears. The eviction order will
be set aside, and the consent order replaced with a new voidable eviction order pursuant to s. 78(12)
of the Act. If the Tenants are able to pay all of the rent
and costs owing by March 15, 2022, as they claim, the tenancy will continue. If
they are not able to pay the full amount, then the Landlord will be able to go
to the Sheriff and enforce the eviction order.
 
12.  The monthly rent is $2,850.00, and it is due on the 20th day of each month.
 
13.  The Landlord is holding a last month’s
rent deposit of $2,850.00 on behalf of the Tenants.
 
14.  The Tenants owe $4,576.00 to December 19,
2021, including the cost of filing the application. This amount does not include
a deduction of $1,000.00 the Tenants allege they have paid on December 14,
2021.




 
 
 
15.  This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
 
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TNL-34753-21, issued on October
12, 2021, is set aside.
 
2.    
The Landlord's application under section
78 of the Act is dismissed.
 
3.    
Order TNL-31021-21, issued on July 19, 2021, is cancelled and replaced by the following order.
 
4.    
Unless the Tenants void
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 15, 2022.
 
5.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$3,720.96*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 10, 2022, less
the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
6.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $93.70
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 11, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
7.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March 15, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 16,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
8.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 15, 2022, then starting March 16, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.

of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 16, 2022.
 
10. 
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$7,426.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 19, 2022, or
ii)             
$13,126.00 if the payment
is made on or before
March 15, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this
paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
11. 
The Tenants
may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after March




 
16, 2022 but before

once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
