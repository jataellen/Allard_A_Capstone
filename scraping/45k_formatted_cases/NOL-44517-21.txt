Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44517-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


B, 112 MAIN
  STREET
SOUTH PORCUPINE ON P0N1H0


 




Between:


Estella Miller Dale Copeland


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Katie-Lynn Ervin


Tenant



 
 
 
Estella Miller and Dale Copeland
(the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Katie-Lynn Ervin
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 3, 2022. Only the Landlords’ Legal Representative, Philipe
Hoff-Hamann, attended the hearing.
As of 3:36 p.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has
not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay
for the period from November 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords served a
Notice of Termination effective November 20, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,300.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
 
6.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 22, 2022.
 
2.     The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $4,402.21*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 11, 2022.
 
3.     The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $42.74 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 12,
2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing* on or before February 22, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 23,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 22, 2022, then starting
February 23, 2022, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlords, on or after February 23, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 22, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $5,386.00** to the Landlords or
to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain
in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after February 23, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
