Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-94063-18
 










 
 

HA (the
'Landlord') filed a request to re-open the Landlord's application because SG
(the 'Tenant') did not comply with the terms of their mediated settlement dated
August 8, 2018.
 
This
request was heard in Burlington on November 9, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       The
Tenant did not pay
the full amount she was required to pay for the month of August.  She was short
$60.00. She explained that the shortfall was through inadvertence
with her bank.  She has since made the $60.00 payment however, according to the
Landlord she has not paid her rent owing for the months of September and
October.
2.      The Tenant explained
that she decided not make any rent payments because she disputes the amount of
rent claimed by the Landlord.  The Landlord says the rent is $1000.00 per month
inclusive of utilities and the Tenant says the rent is $900.00 plus $100 per
month for utilities.  She also alleges that the unit I s in need of repairs but
did not compared to raise her s. 82 issues.
3.      Since the
Tenant did not comply with the terms of the mediated agreement, the Landlord's
request to re-open the application is allowed.
4.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from March 1, 2018 to November 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective June 12, 2018.
5.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,000.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
6.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 12, 2017 to
June 12, 2018.
7.      The
Tenant explained that fell into arrears as well because of a chronic illness
and she has just recently returned to work. 
8.      I have
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until December 15, 2018  pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before December 15, 2018.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $7,005.76*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to November 15, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $32.88 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting November 16, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If the
Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before November
26, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from November 27, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If the
unit is not vacated on or before December 15, 2018, then starting December 16,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after December 16,
2018.
8.      If the
Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay
to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $8,690.00 if the payment is made on or before November 30, 2018, or
ii)       $9,690.00 if the payment is made on or before December 15, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after December 16, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
