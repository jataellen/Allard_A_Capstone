Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
File Number: TSL-22834-21
 



In the matter
of:


MAIN FLOOR, 82 GOUGH AVENUE TORONTO ON M4K3N8


 




Between:


Amelia Touras


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Athanasios Kourakos


Tenant



 
Amelia Touras (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict Athanasios Kourakos (the 'Tenant') because
the Landlord has entered into an agreement of purchase and sale of the rental
unit and the purchaser requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation.
 
The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard via
video/teleconference on October
12, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord and the Landlord's Legal Representative
Nicholas Kapelos attended
the hearing.
 
As of 10:12 a.m.,
the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
This is an application under section 49(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act).
 
2.     Subsection 49(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2006 (‘the Act’) which states in part:
“a landlord
who has entered into an agreement of purchase and sale (APS) of the residential
complex may, on behalf of the purchaser, give the Tenant of a unit in the
residential complex a notice terminating the tenancy, if the purchaser in good faith requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation
 
3.     On June 30, 2021 the Landlord gave the Tenant a (N12)
form notice to end the tenancy because the purchaser required possession of the rental
unit. The termination date in the (N12) notice was August 31, 2021.
 
4.     The Tenant did not vacate
the rental unit on
August 31, 2021 in accordance with the termination
date set out in the notice given.




 
5.    
A copy of the Agreement of
Purchase and Sale was submitted confirming that the Landlord has sold the property to the Purchaser. The closing has since been amended to October 29, 2021.
 
6.     The Landlord has filed a declaration from a George C Zozoronis, the named purchaser setting out his intention to
take possession of the rental unit for personal use for a minimum of one year.
 
7.    
The Landlord paid the compensation equal to one month's rent on July 21, 2021.
 
8.     The Landlord is seeking termination of the tenancy on or before October
31, 2021.
 
9.     Based on the uncontested testimonies given and documentary evidence submitted, I find
the Landlord has met all the technical requirements pursuant to section 49 of
the Residential Tenancies Act.
 
1)    
The N12 notice was properly given.
 
2)    
The Landlord has entered
into a bonafide Agreement of Purchase and Sale (APS).
 
3)    
A
Declaration was filed by the Purchaser
and was verbally affirmed at the hearing.
 
4)    
Compensation has been
paid to the Tenant pursuant
to the Act.
 
10.  After consideration of all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including the impact of the COVID pandemic
on the parties, I find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction
until October 31, 2021 to provide the Tenant the additional time to find
alternative accommodation as requested.
 
11.  The order contains
all the reasons for the decision
within the order.
No other reasons
will be issued.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated, as of October 31, 2021. The Tenant
must move out of the rental unit on or before October 31, 2021.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before October 31, 2021, then starting November
1, 2021, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after November 1, 2021.




 
4.    
If the unit is not vacated on or
before October 31, 2021, the Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $16.44
per day for compensation for the use of the unit from November 1, 2021
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.     If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before
October 31, 2021, the Tenant will
start to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from November 1, 2021 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
