Landlord

Kayla Davies


Tenant



 
 
See Schedule A (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order determining that Kayla Davies
(the 'Tenant') abandoned the
rental unit.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
988 4914 7021# on February
7, 2022. The Landlord’s
representative Lyndsay Dubois attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant was last seen in June
2021 before a police raid. The
Landlord has left notices for the Tenant to contact them but has heard nothing. The Landlord has sent someone to see if the Tenant is there every couple
of weeks but there has been no sign
of the Tenant since June 2021. Rent
was last paid in May 2021.
 
2.     I find the Tenant has abandoned the rental unit.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is
terminated,
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
February 25, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
