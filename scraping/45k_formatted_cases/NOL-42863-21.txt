Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-42863-21



In the matter
of:


103, 940 STOCKDALE ROAD NORTH BAY ON P1B6L6


 




Between:


Northshore Property Management


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Amos Rickard Melanie Laderoute


 
Tenants



 
 
Northshore Property Management (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict Amos Rickard and Melanie Laderoute (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 16, 2021.
Only the Landlord's Agents, Alida Gibb and Laurie Murray, attended
the hearing. As of 9:39 a.m. the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from
November 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective May 10,
2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,226.40.
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
5.    
The Landlord
sent a letter to the Tenants on the necessity
of a repayment agreement. The Landlord’s attempts at negotiating a
repayment agreement were unsuccessful.
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,200.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent
deposit is owing to the Tenants for
the period from November 3, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
 
8.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with section 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties
and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant,




 
and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act. The amount outstanding is
substantial, and the Tenants have not paid any rent since the application was
filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated. The
Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before January 17, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $12,054.44*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 6, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $40.32 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 7, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 17, 2022, the
Tenants will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 18, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January 18, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
January 18, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 17, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $14,384.80** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenants
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or
after January 18, 2022 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant
possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
