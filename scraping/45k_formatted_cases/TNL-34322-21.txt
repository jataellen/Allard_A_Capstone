Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-34322-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


311, 15 NORTH
PARK ROAD THORNHILL ON
  L4J0A1


 




Between:


Abraham Moses


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Adir Oron Peretz


Tenant



 
 
 
Abraham Moses (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Adir Oron
Peretz (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes (the ‘L1 application’) and because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or a person the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
seriously impaired the safety of any person (the ‘L2 application’).
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021.
 
The Landlord and
the Tenant attended the hearing. The Landlord was represented by Mark Breslow. The Tenant represented himself throughout but consulted with Tenant Duty Counsel
prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
At the beginning of the
hearing, the Landlord requested the consent of the Board to withdraw the L2 application. In accordance with subsection 200(4) of the Act, I consented
to the withdrawal of the application.
 
2.    
There is no dispute
between the parties that the Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period from March 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination effective March 29, 2021.
 
3.    
However, the Tenant does dispute the amount of rent arrears
owing.
 
4.    
At the beginning of the
hearing the Tenant stated that he was only three months in arrears as opposed to the five claimed by the Landlord.
But part way through the hearing
he acknowledged owing four. The Tenant says he pays by way of e-transfer but at
the hearing he failed to produce or file any banking records showing his
payments. In




 
contrast the Landlord was able to testify precisely
as to which months were paid and which were not.
 
5.    
Given the Tenant’s inconsistent statements about how many months
are outstanding, his failure to produce financial records easily accessible to him, and the precise
and detailed accounting of
the Landlord, I prefer the Landlord’s evidence over that of the Tenant and find
that:
 
a.   
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,950.00.
 
b.   
The Tenant
paid the Landlord
$9,750.00 after the application was filed on April 13, 2021.
 
c.   
The rent arrears owing
for the period
ending December 31, 2021 total
$9,750.00.
 
6.    
The Landlord
incurred costs of $201.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
 
7.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $3,900.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
8.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from August 1, 2020 to March 29, 2021. I calculate the
interest owing is $2.58.
 
9.    
The next issue before
the Board is with respect
to relief from eviction. The Tenant seeks delay until February 28, 2022. The
Landlord seeks a standard order.
 
10.  Having considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
I find that it would
not be unfair to postpone
the eviction until January 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
I say this for the following reasons.
 
11.  The Tenant is currently working in a pizza
place His take home pay is about $600.00 a week which means his total monthly
income is about $2,600.00. He is divorced and his former wife and children live
in Israel. He says he pays child support of $2,300.00 each month. When I
pointed out that this means he cannot afford the rental unit, he told me that he has friends
in the community who help him out financially. He provided no further
details.
 
12.  He also says that in three or four months
he can get money owing to him from the Israeli army. He provided no details as to how much money this would be nor did he provide any documentary evidence in support of the
assertion this money was coming to him. In fact, the Tenant initially refused
to answer questions about it at all but eventually stated that the army puts
money aside to assist on marriage or the starting of a business and it is paid
out after ten years.
 
13.  The Tenant says that things
would be different if the Landlord
did not ignore
his requests for repairs. He says the sink has been leaking for the
last five months and he has an




 
invoice to prove he paid $620.00
to fix the washer and dryer. The Landlord says he has never been told about the sink or the
washer and dryer and would be happy to pay the invoice if the Tenant would send
it to him.
 
14.  Finally, the Tenant says that he needs more
time because his children are arriving in Canada on the Monday
following the hearing
to visit. His mother has already arrived
as part of the visitation arrangement and is staying with him. It is not
clear how long the planned visit is supposed to be, but the Tenant is hoping
they will be with him for two months.
 
15.  The Landlord is a retired senior. He owns
three rental units and his own home. The rental units produce a
monthly income of about $400.00 to $500.00 a month each. His pension income is
about $3,700.00 a month. He says he has been able to cover the expenses related
to the rental unit in the face of the Tenant’s default by using his personal
funds. He has not fallen
into debt, defaulted on the mortgage, or relied on a line of credit.
But the Tenant’s behaviour in
defaulting on the rent is stressful. He has to worry about his cash flow and
covering the expenses.
 
16.  The Landlord confirms
in part some of the Tenant’s evidence. He has received
interact transfers on behalf of the Tenant from someone else, but he
knows nothing about the disrepair claimed by the Tenant nor was he aware of the
Tenant’s children being scheduled to arrive shortly.
 
17.  As I explained
at the hearing, the issue for the Board is whether or not it would be unfair
in all of the circumstances to grant relief form eviction. That test requires a
balancing of the interests of both parties.
 
18.  The evidence before the Board supports the conclusion that the Tenant cannot
afford the rental unit and the rent
arrears are considerable. Absent more detailed evidence with respect to the money coming to the Tenant from the Israeli army, this means that it would
be unfair to refuse eviction or put in place a repayment plan. Both would
simply be unfair to the Landlord
as the evidence does not support the conclusion the Tenant can pay what is owing.
 
19. 
With respect to delay, the Landlord is not yet facing financial hardship, he appears to be holding two months rent as a deposit, and despite being asked, he led no evidence as to
attempts he has made to negotiate with the Tenant some sort of
repayment plan. Those are all factors which support giving some delay to the
Tenant.
 
20.  I give no weight to the disrepair
evidence as it is refuted
by the Landlord. In other words,
the Tenant has failed to lead sufficient evidence to establish his disrepair
claims on the balance of probabilities.
 
21.  I would also note that I have considered
the delays and impacts on both parties of the current pandemic. It makes moving
challenging and has created extra delays in terms of Board hearings
and enforcement of orders. In other words,
it adversely impacts
everyone albeit in different ways.




 
22.  Finally,
as I have no reason
to doubt the Tenant’s statements about his family
situation, it seems to me
that given all of the circumstances here it would not be unfair to delay
eviction long enough for the children to arrive, and for the Tenant to find
alternative housing. That being said, given that the Tenant has his mother here
to help him the Tenant should not need the more than two months delay he asked
for at the hearing.
 
23.  As a result of all of the above, the
eviction shall be delayed until the end of January, 2022. The Tenant will be
entitled to remain in the rental unit if he pays the rent arrears and costs
owing. Otherwise, the Landlord may enforce the eviction order
by filing it with
the Court Enforcement Office after January 31, 2022.
 
24.  This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s L2 application is dismissed.
 
THE L1 APPLICATION
 
2.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 31, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$6,285.67*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 5,
2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $64.11
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 6, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
16, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
7.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022, then starting February
1, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
8.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 1, 2022.
 
9.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$9,951.00 if the payment
is made on or before
December 31, 2021, or
ii)             
$11,901.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022**.




 
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
10.  The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
