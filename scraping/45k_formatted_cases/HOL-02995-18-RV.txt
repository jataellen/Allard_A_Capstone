Order under Section 21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-02995-18-RV










 
 

Review Order
 
J.S
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict A.Y
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was resolved by order HOL-02995-18 issued on July 25, 2018,
dismissing the application as abandoned.
 
On
July 31, 2018, a Board Initiated Review was commenced pursuant to Rule
29.4 of the Board’s Rules of Practice to determine whether the Landlord was
reasonably able to participate in the original hearing.
 
The
request was heard in Toronto on August 20, 2018.
 
Only
the Landlord’s legal representative, J.E (“JE”), attended the hearing.   The
Tenant did not attend the hearing although I was satisfied that he received
proper notice of the date, time and location of the hearing.  Nonetheless, I
waited until after 10 a.m.   When the Tenant still did not attend, I proceeded
to hear the request for review.
 
Determinations:
 
Request for Review
 
1.      Only
JE attended the hearing of the request for review.  He explained that on the
hearing date, the Landlord attended the hearing site and was directed to the
hearing room where the unopposed matters were being heard.  As it was perceived
that the Tenant did not attend the hearing site, the Landlord proceeded to
request an order of termination before the presiding member in the unopposed
room. Thereafter, the Landlord left the hearing site, thinking that the matter
was completed.
2.      The
Tenant had attended at the hearing site and the matter was recalled before
another member and the application was dismissed as abandoned.
3.      JE
submitted that the Landlord clearly intended to attend and participate in the
hearing, but due to administrative oversight, could not do so.
4.      I
agree with the submissions of JE.  It is plain from the case law (see: King-Winton
v. Doverhold Investments Ltd. [2008] O.J. 4697 (Ont. Div. Ct); Sutherland
v. Lamontagne [2008] O.J. No. 5763 (Ont. Div. Ct.); Bouillion v. Kennedy
[2011] O.J. No. 2223 (Ont. Div. Ct); Kewallal v. Jackson [2011] O.J. No.
1219 (Ont. Div. Ct.); Decosse v. Isels of Innisfree Non-Profit Homes
[2012] O.J. No. 964 (Ont. Div. Ct).; and Brewer v. Landlord and Tenant Board
Southern RO [2018] ONSC 1009 (Ont. Div. Ct.) that a party who knows about a
hearing and genuinely intends to participate but somehow does not, should be
given an opportunity to be heard. 
5.      In
this case, the Landlord clearly intended to participate in the hearing and
attended at the hearing site, on time for a hearing.  It was only by
administrative oversight at the hearing location on the hearing date that the
Landlord’s application ended up being dismissed.
6.      Under
the totality of the circumstances before me, and mindful of the Divisional
Court’s direction that the term “not reasonably able to participate” shall be
liberally construed; I granted the Landlord’s request for review.
7.      Accordingly,
the matter proceeded immediately to a hearing of the Landlord’s application de
novo (i.e. a hearing again).
Hearing
De Novo
8.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from June 1, 2018 to August 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective June 17, 2018.
9.     
The Tenant is in possession of
the rental unit. 
10.   The monthly rent as of the date of the hearing is $2,500.00.
11.   The
Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
12.   The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $2,500.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
13.   Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from October 7, 2017
to June 17, 2018.
14.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
request to review is granted. Order HOL-02995-18 issued on July 25, 2018 is
cancelled and replaced by the following order. 
2.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before September 7, 2018.
3.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4,701.43*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to August 27, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $82.19 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting August 28, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
5.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
6.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
September 7, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from September 8, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
7.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before September 7, 2018, then starting September
8, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after September 8,
2018.
9.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $7,675.00 if the payment is made on or before August 31, 2018, or
ii)       $10,175.00 if the payment is made on or before September 7, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
10.   The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after September 8, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
