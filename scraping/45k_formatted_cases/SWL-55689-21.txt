Centurion Property Associates Inc
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ciara Vella-Zarb (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 20, 2022. Only
the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Robert Rose,
attended the hearing. As of 11:22 a.m.,
the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not
paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective October 29, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on
October 25, 2021. The Tenant was in possession
of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $726.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $726.00 from the
Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 2, 2019 to October 29, 2021.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of October
25, 2021, the date
the Tenant returned vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.

2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $674.87*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to October
25, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
10, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 11, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
