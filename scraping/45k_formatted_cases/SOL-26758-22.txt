Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26758-22
 



In the matter
of:


3,
  2433 FIRST STREET BURLINGTON ON L7R1C7


 




Between:


John Bukovcan


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Mike McCormick


Tenant



 
 
On December 24, 2021, John
Bukovcan (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Mike McCormick (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on
October 26, 2021 with respect to application SOL-20895-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed
to pay to the Landlord
$1,000.00 on or before December
17, 2021 towards arrears of
rent. The Tenant paid $800.00.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $3,627.04 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
SOL-20895-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $827.04
and that amount is
included in this order. As a result,
the previous order
SOL-20895-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,200.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from December 1, 2016
to January 18, 2022.




File Number: SOL-26758-22
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Order SOL-20895-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 29, 2022.
 
3.     As of the date of this order, the Tenant owes no money
to the Landlord because the amount of the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the
arrears of rent up to and including
December 31, 2021, that the Landlord is entitled
to under this order by $461.83.
 
4.     The Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenant:
$41.06 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 1,
2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     The Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 29, 2022, then starting
January 30, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 30, 2022.

The tenant has until January 28, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 28, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.
 
In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on July 30, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction
where the rental unit is located.
