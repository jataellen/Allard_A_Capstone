Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number: EAL-98263-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
912, 145 YORK
STREET OTTAWA ON K1N8Y3


 




Between:


Hazelview Property Serives Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jiaqi Wang


Tenant



 
 
 
Hazelview Property Serives Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict Jiaqi Wang (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 1, 2022. Only
the Landlord's Legal Representative, Allan Kouri,
attended the hearing.
As of 11:52 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period from April 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective October 14,
2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,343.39
as of January 1, 2022.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,343.39 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.     The Landlord has paid interest on the rent deposit up
to December 31, 2021. If the tenancy terminates pursuant
to this order,
the Landlord will not owe any further
interest on the rent deposit.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the




 
Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 22, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$7,122.65*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 11, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $44.17
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 12, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
22, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 23, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 22, 2022, then starting
February 23, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 23, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 22, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $9,509.60** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 23, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
