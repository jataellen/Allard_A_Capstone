Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-32399-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


18 NOTTINGHAM DRIVE RICHMOND HILL ON L4S1Z6


 




Between:


Shuxin Liu Hong Chen


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Alireza Deldoust Fattahi Sahar Froughi Tabalvandani


Tenants



 
 
 
Shuxin Liu and
Hong Chen (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Alireza Deldoust Fattahi and Sahar Froughi Tabalvandani (the 'Tenants')
because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in
the residential complex have substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlords or another tenant.
; because they intend to do major repairs or renovations to the rental unit
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 980 0061 7732# on August
5, 2021. The Landlord
Shuxin Liu, and the Tenants, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlords served a notice
on the Tenants that requires
the rental unit to be vacant to do repairs or renovations so extensive
that they are required to get a building permit and the rental unit must be
vacant to do the work.
 
2.    
The notice
indicates that there
will be renovations to the basement, bathroom, kitchen, painting, repair/replace floors, fix a
staircase, fix an exterior wall…and so on, including any issues found in the water/air duct system.
 
3.    
The Landlord
had no pictures to show the Board that vacate
possession is necessary.
 
4.    
The Landlord
claims that the Tenants will not permit
entry to the rental home.
 
5.    
The Landlords
have not obtained
a building permit and there is no evidence one has
been applied for at this time.




File Number: TNL-32399-21
 
6.    
The notice was served
on May 2, 2021 and the application was filed with the Board on May 17, 2020, a process the Landlords started
some 8 months ago. It seems reasonable that the Landlords would have
taken more steps to demonstrate that vacant possession is required to perform these renovations.
 
7.    
The Tenants
showed photographs of the interior
of the home to show that this work is not
necessary. They testified that they
have lived in the home for seven years and do not believe thar renovations are
required. They also testified that
the Landlords do not provide the required notice to enter the home when they
show up.
 
8.    
The Landlords have not
demonstrated they are prepared to do the work outlined or that the work is
required. They have not obtained a building permit in the eight months since the notice was served
on which they indicated they will obtain
a building permit.
There is no evidence vacant
possession is required.
 
9.    
Under the circumstances, I find it would be unfair to terminate the tenancy.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlords' application is dismissed.
