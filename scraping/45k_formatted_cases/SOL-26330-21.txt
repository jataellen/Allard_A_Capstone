2494899
Ontario Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Laura Leblanc (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental
unit or a person the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has seriously
impaired the safety of any person. The Landlord also claimed compensation for
each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This
application was heard by video conference on January 14, 2022. The Landlord’s
Agent, P. Hendershott, the Landlord's Legal Representative, J. McDougall, the
Tenant’s son, C. LeBlanc (CL) and the Tenant attended the hearing. M. Lindner
(ML) and R. Vance (RV) also attended the hearing and were witnesses for the
Landlord.
 
Preliminary Issue:
 
The Tenant’s
request for an adjournment because the Landlord filed other applications
regarding damage to a previous unit is denied. Section 183 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (‘the Act’) provides that the Board shall adopt the
most expeditious method of determining the questions arising in a proceeding
that affords to all persons directly affected
by the proceeding an adequate opportunity to know the issues and be
heard on the matter. As the Tenant was served with both a notice of termination
and the Notice of Hearing in this case which does not contain allegations of
damage to the unit, I found it fair to proceed with the hearing of the
application.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     On November 26, 2021, the Landlord served the Tenant
with a Notice to End your Tenancy for Causing Serious Problems in the Rental
Unit or Residential Complex (N7) with a termination date of December 6, 2021.
 
2.     The Landlord alleged in the notice that on June 2,
2021, the Landlord received a complaint about a foul smell emanating from the
rental unit; on September 28, 2021, the unit was found to be in an unsanitary
condition and contractors who were required to
work in the unit needed
respirators to enter the unit; on October
1, 2021, a contractor




 
refused to
re-enter the unit due to the foul smell in the unit; on November 17, 2021,
officials from the fire department attended the unit for an inspection, following a complaint from an unknown source,
and subsequently issued an Inspection Order due to the state of the unit; and on November 26, 2021, the
Landlord attended the unit and found it to be in the same state of
uncleanliness.
 
Landlord’s Evidence
 
3.     ML, the Fire Inspector who attended the unit on
November 17, 2021, testified that there were piles of over 3 feet of items in
the unit, no clear pathways, excess combustible materials and the windows and
sliding glass door were obstructed by items. As a result of the state of the unit, ML issued an Inspection Order
dated November 24, 2021 which the Landlord relied on as evidence at the
hearing. The report found that “… access to rooms and spaces within the unit
are obstructed, which would impede occupants from safely exiting, and
conversely would impede firefighters when entering/exiting the unit during an
emergency situation”. Both the Landlord and the Tenant were directed to rectify
the conditions of the unit.
 
4.     ML further testified that the Tenant was required to
rectify the state of the unit by January 12, 2022 but the follow-up inspection
could not be done physically due to the pandemic. As a result, the Tenant
submitted pictures of the rental unit showing compliance with the Inspection
Order. ML found the pictures to be a good representation of the rental unit
and intends to issue an order of compliance.
 
5.     RV, the Landlord’s Building Manager, testified that he
was present on November 17, 2021
during the inspection and identified the pictures taken of the rental unit
showing the unit in a despicable state with no clear pathways and an alarming
amount of combustible materials. Unlike ML who stated that he did not notice
any smell in the unit although the likelihood of one is plausible, RV was
‘disgusted’ by the state of the unit.
 
Tenant’s Evidence
 
6.     The Tenant’s son, CL, stated that the claim about a
foul smell in the unit is false and, in any event, the unit has been restored
to a normal state. The Tenant offered to give a virtual tour of the unit.
 
7.     The Tenant has resided in the residential complex for
7 years and about one year in the current unit. The Tenant, who is employed and
resides in the unit with her adult son and daughter, stated that they will find
it difficult to find alternative accommodation in a reasonable time due to the
pandemic.
 
Analysis
 
8.     Section 66 (1) of the Act provides that a Landlord may
give a Tenant a notice of termination of the tenancy if an act or omission of
the Tenant, seriously impairs or has seriously impaired the safety of any person;
and the act or omission occurs in the residential complex. The Landlord’s
evidence about the state of the unit is supported by both pictures
of the rental unit and the Inspection
Order, and apart from the claim about




 
the foul smell, is not disputed by the Tenant.
I find the huge piles of combustible materials in the rental
unit a fire hazard and a serious
impairment of the safety of
all the residents in the
residential complex, including that of the Tenant and her family.
 
9.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction
subject to the condition(s) set out
in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. As the Act
is a remedial legislation and the Tenant complied with the Inspection Order,
the Tenant will be given an opportunity to continue the tenancy subject to the
conditions below.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.   
For a one-year period
commencing immediately, the Tenant shall
maintain the rental
unit in an ordinary state of cleanliness and ensure that there is:
 
a.    clear pathways to and from every room in
the rental unit.
 
b.    no clutter in
the rental unit.
 
c.   
no obstruction of the glass sliding
door, windows, or vents in the rental
unit; and
 
d.    continued compliance with the Inspection Order issued on November 24,
2021.
 
2.   
The Landlord may inspect the
rental unit once every three months
or earlier to determine if the Tenant has complied with the conditions set out
in paragraph 1. The Landlord must first
serve a notice of entry at least 24 hours in advance.
 
3.   
If the Tenant fails to meet any of
the conditions set out in paragraph 1, the Landlord may apply under section 78
of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The
Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a breach of a condition
set out in paragraph 1 of this order.
 
4.   
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.   
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing on or before January 30, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest calculated from January 31, 2022 at 2.00% annually
on the balance outstanding.
