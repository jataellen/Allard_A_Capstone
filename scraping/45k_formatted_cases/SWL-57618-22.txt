Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57618-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


A,
  49 HOLBORN DRIVE KITCHENER ON N2A2C9


 




Between:


Waterloo Region
Housing


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Amanda Underwood


Tenant



 
 
 
Waterloo Region Housing (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Amanda
Underwood (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the
Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on September 2, 2021 with respect to
application SWL-51067-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $607.35 on or before
January 1, 2022. The Tenant
did not pay
$1016.00 rent on or before
January 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $12,147.00 for rent arrears
and the costs
related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
SWL-51067-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $10,928.30 and
that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order
SWL-51067-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing .




File Number: SWL-57618-22
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     Order SWL-51067-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 13, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $12,011.11*.(less
any amount that has been paid since the application was filed on January 19, 2022.)This amount represents
the rent owing up to February 2, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the previous
application.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$33.40 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 3, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
13, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 14, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 13, 2022, then starting
February 14, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 14, 2022.

The tenant has until February 12, 2022
to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by February 12, 2022 the order will be stayed and the Board will schedule a hearing.
