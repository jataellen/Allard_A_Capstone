Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57054-21



In the matter
of:


42, 575 WILKINS STREET LONDON ON N6C5J2


 




Between:


M.F. Arnsby Property Management Ltd.


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Ivan Osmond


Tenant



 
On November
8, 2021, M.F. Arnsby
Property Management Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ivan Osmond (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes
because the Tenant failed to meet a
condition specified in the order issued by the Board on October 1, 2021 with
respect to application SWL-51795-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenant was to remove
all items from the yard and porch
on or before October 10,
2021. As of November 8, 2021, the
Tenant has failed to remove all items from the yard and porch.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $186.00 for costs in Order SWL-51795-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $186.00 and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous order SWL-51795-21
is cancelled.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $765.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from August 1, 2013 to January 4, 2022.




File Number: SWL-57054-21
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Order SWL-51795-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 15, 2022.
 
3.    
As of the date of this
order, the Tenant owes no money to the Landlord because the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit
exceeds the amount, that the Landlord is entitled to under this order by
$669.32.
 
4.    
The Landlord
is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenant:
$27.29 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 5,
2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.    
The Landlord
or the Tenant shall pay any amounts
that become owing as a result of this
order.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 16, 2022.
 
 
 
January 4, 2022                                                                              Date Issued                                                                       Jim McMaster

The tenant has until January 14, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 14, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.
 
If you have any questions about
this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.
 
In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on July 16, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction
where the rental unit is located.
