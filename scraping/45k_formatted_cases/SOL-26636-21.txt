Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26636-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


970 PARKDALE AVENUE FORT ERIE ON L2A5B6


 




Between:


Sam Passero


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Jim Hoffman


Tenant



 
 
Sam Passero (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jim Hoffman
(the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes
because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on
July 27, 2021 with respect to application SOL-20685-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following condition
specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $600.00 (rent) on
or before November 1, 2021.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$5,386.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application
fee in Order SOL-20685-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $4,186.00 and that amount
is included in this order.
As a result, the previous order SOL-20685-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from January 11, 2021 to January 31, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
SOL-20685-21 is cancelled.




File Number: SOL-26636-21
 
2.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 17, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $5,504.36*. (less any payments made by the Tenant after this
application was filed on November 23, 2021).This amount represents the rent owing up to January
6, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the previous application.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$19.73 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 7, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
January 17, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
January 18, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January
18, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 18, 2022.

The tenant has until January 16, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under
s. 77(6) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 16, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.
