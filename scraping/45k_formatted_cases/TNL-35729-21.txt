Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Csilla Kemeny
  Sandor Heredi


Tenants



 
 
 
King East Developments Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sandor
Heredi and Csilla
Kemeny (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord
intends to demolish the rental unit.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on January 6, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s
legal representative Howard Levenson, and the Landlord’s representative Jack
Greenberg attended on behalf
of the Landlord. Csilla Kemeny
attended on behalf
of the Tenants.
 
Application
 
1.   
The Landlords
have filed an L2 application based on an N13 notice that was served upon the Tenant on September 3rd,
2021.
 
2.    The Landlord has
obtained the required permits to demolish the
rental unit, as one of 30 different units which are being demolished for the purposes
of constructing 47 residential
homes.
 
3.    The Tenants unit
is the last house in which the
Landlords do not have vacant possession and require same to affect
demolition of the house and to continue sewer, telecommunication, and power construction for the subdivision. This construction is set to take place on February 1st,
2022.
 
4.    The rent for the
unit is $1800.00. The Tenant
was compensated one month’s rent by way of a waiver of rent for the month of
February 2021. There is no last month’s rent on deposit.




 
5.   
The Landlord
provided evidence by way of the Lease to show that the Tenant was aware
of this demolition as early as 2013 when it was signed.
 
Tenant’s Evidence
 
6.    The Tenant testified that another N13 application had previously been dealt with by way of
a hearing in September 2021, in which the application had been dismissed as not
having been properly served. She mentions this previous hearing to support her
assertion that she is not responsible for the delay in the demolition.
 
7.   
The Tenant further provided
evidence that her family were looking to downsize but were having issues
finding a comparable unit in the area. She says that her and her
family have been looking for
a new place to live since March 2021 but has been having issues with COVID-19
restrictions in doing so. I note that the Tenant might have faced less restrictions in the summer months of 2021
when restrictions were not as strict
as they are currently.
 
8.   
In cross-examination, the Tenant
was asked why they had not availed themselves of the assistance of a realtor
who the Landlord had contact her to support her and her family in finding a new
home. The Tenant testified that she was unaware of who the realtor was. She was further questioned about having received
a reference letter
from the Landlord
but testified that due to being
evicted by the Landlord, that prospective Landlords would not rent to her.
 
9.   
I
find this evidence
difficult to comprehend. The N13 is a no-fault
eviction and certainly should not reflect poorly on the
Tenant. I also find it difficult to believe that every prospective Landlord
would have been even aware of the application.
 
10. The Tenant in her submissions stated that the COVID-19
pandemic has seriously hampered her ability
to find a new rental
unit. The concept
of video chats with prospective Landlords in not an ideal
situation for her, as she would prefer to see units in person.
 
11. The Tenant requested further time to move and had requested further compensation from the
Landlord to assist with same. She testified
that because she had to hire a paralegal to respond to an unrelated Superior Court
application initiated by the Landlord against her, that the Landlord should
compensate her even more.
 
Determinations:
 
12. I find that the
Landlord requires the rental unit to be vacated to demolish it. I am satisfied
that the Landlord has obtained the necessary
permits for this work. I find further that the work that is
required to be conducted is a demolition in the ordinary sense of the
term, as the entire building will be razed for the new construction to
be built.
 
13.
As a result, I find that the work does constitute “demolition” under Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”).




 
14. I am satisfied that the Tenant was compensated one
month’s rent before the proposed Termination
Date by the Landlord in accordance with s. 52 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”).
I am further satisfied that the house
contained only one residential
unit and such, only one month’s rent was required to be compensated.
 
15. I find that the Tenant
has been given ample opportunity to find new accommodations. She was paid her compensation in February
2021 and was well-aware at that point of the Landlord’s intentions. I further
find that while the Tenant did receive
a reference letter from the
Landlord, that she did not avail herself
of the supports offered by the Landlord to find a new rental
accommodation.
 
16. While I can certainly agree with the Tenant that it is better to view prospective rental units in
person, the Tenant likely had less restrictions in the summer months of 2021
and should have used that time appropriately in order to view units. That said,
at this point in the pandemic I find that it might not be as easy to find new
accommodations.
 
17. That said, I
am prepared to extend the Landlord’s termination date of
January 31st, 2022 to March 31st, 2022 to allow the Tenant
more time find new living
accommodations. I will not order any further compensation to
be paid by the Landlord to the Tenant.
 
18. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until March 31st, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
19. The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated, as of March 31st,
2022. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before March
31st, 2022.
 
20. If the unit is not vacated on or before March 31st,
2022, then starting April 1st, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction
may be enforced.
 
21.
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord on or after April 1st, 2022.
 
 
January 31st,
2022
