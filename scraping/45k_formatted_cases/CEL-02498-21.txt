In the
  matter of:


205A, 110 DUNLOP
STREET E BARRIE ON L4M1A5


 




Between:


Harbour Management Corp.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Adriano
Lombardi


Tenant



 
 
 
Harbour
Management Corp. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Adriano Lombardi (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has wilfully or
negligently caused undue damage to the premises.
The Landlord has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenant
to compensate the Landlord for the damage. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit
after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 16, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s
Legal Representative, Bryan Rubin, and the Landlord’s Agent, Alexis Angliss,
attended the hearing. As of 11:15 a.m.,
the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
On August 24, 2021, the
Landlord served the Tenant an N5 Notice of Termination (N5) with a termination date of September
13, 2021. This was the first N5 notice served
to the Tenant which allowed
the Tenant to be able to void the N5 notice if
he paid the Landlord
$750.00 within
7 days of being served
for the cost to repair
the damage he caused to the
rental unit.
 
2.    
The Tenant
is in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is
$850.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
is not holding a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.    
The Landlord’s Legal Representative submitted
that the Tenant
had covered the walls of the rental unit with graffiti.
Pictures presented as evidence showed great damage to the




 
walls of the rental
unit as almost
every wall was covered with spray paint
and permanent marker.
 
6.    
The Landlord’s Agent
added that the damage to the rental unit was discovered during a routine fire
inspection and that the cost to repair and repaint the walls will cost $750.00.
The Tenant has made no effort to pay for the damages
or to try and repair
the damages.
 
7.    
The Landlord’s Legal Representative stated that the Landlord is seeking payment
for the damages and eviction
due to the purposeful nature of the damages to the rental unit.
 
Findings
 
8.    
On the balance of
probabilities, I find that the Tenant wilfully damaged the rental unit. I also find that the Landlord’s claim of $750.00
for compensation to repair the damages is reasonable.
 
Relief From Eviction
 
9.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
10. 
This order
contains all of the reasons
in this matter
and no further reasons will be
issued.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated, as of January 17, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 17, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$750.00, which represents the reasonable costs of
repairing the damage or replacing the damaged property.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$3,186.30, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from September 14,
2021 to January 5, 2022.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$27.95 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from January 6, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
January 16, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
January 17, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January
18, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.




 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 18, 2022.
