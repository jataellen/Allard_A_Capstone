Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24399-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


APARTMENT B, 202 NIAGARA
STREET WELLAND ON L3C1J7


 




Between:


Maria Venditti


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Stacey Marr


Tenant



 
 
 
Maria Venditti (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Stacey
Marr (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires possession of the
rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 19, 2022.
 
The Landlord attended the hearing and was represented by her paralegal Sidney Sheridan.
 
The Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with the notice of hearing by
the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     On August 30, 2021 the Landlord served the Tenant a Notice of Termination (the ‘N12’). The N12
alleges the Landlord’s son seen needs possession of the rental unit for the
purpose of residential occupation. The N12 specified the tenancy was to
terminate October 31, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s son, John Vindetti,
swore an affidavit that he requires the
unit for his personal use for a period of at least one year in accordance with section 72(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2006 (The
‘Act’)
 
3.     The Landlord paid the Tenant
one month’s compensation on August 30, 2021, in accordance with section 48.1 of the Act.
 
4.     I am satisfied, based on the Landlord’s uncontested evidence, that the Landlord’s son requires possession of the rental unit for residential
occupation.




 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $500.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.     The Landlord’s representative was unaware of any
circumstances that would warrant denying or delaying
eviction. The Tenant was not present at the hearing, and thus the Board did not hear from them any
submissions that might be relevant to s. 83. I have considered all the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
February 12, 2022 The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 12, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$991.53, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from November 1, 2021
to February 1, 2022, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $16.44 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from February 2, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February
12, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 13, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 12, 2022, then starting
February 13, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 13, 2022.
 
 
February 1, 2022
