Residential Tenancies Act, 2006

In the matter
of:


14 ROTHERHAM AVE TORONTO ON M6M1L8


 




Between:


Roma Rana Urja Rana


Tenants




 


 
and


 




 


Hussam (aka Sam) Amash


Landlord



 
 
 
Roma Rana and Urja Rana (the 'Tenants') applied
for an order determining that Hussam (aka Sam) Amash (the 'Landlord') has
collected or retained money illegally (T1 application).
 
Roma Rana and Urja Rana (the
'Tenants') applied for an order determining that Hussam (aka Sam) Amash (the 'Landlord') harassed, obstructed, coerced,
threatened or interfered with them and
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or
residential complex by the Tenants or by a member of their household (T2
application).
 
The applications were heard
together by video
conference on November
16, 2021.
 
At 9:35 am, the Tenants and the Landlord’s Representative Lorrie McCullough (LM) attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
The issue
to be determined by the Board is whether the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) applies
to the matters before me.
 
2.    Section 5
(i) of the Act states:
 
This Act does not apply with respect to,
 
(i) living accommodation whose occupant
or occupants are required to share a bathroom
or kitchen facility with the owner,
the owner’s spouse,
child or parent or the
spouse’s child or parent, and
where the owner, spouse, child or parent lives in the building in which the
living accommodation is located;




 
3.   
The rental unit is a single family home containing 3 rental units.
 
4.   
The Tenants
allege that the Landlord
did not live at the property from July 28, 2019
through to and including September 26, 2019.
 
5.   
The Landlord’s Representative provided evidence
that the Landlord
lived at the residential
complex during the period in question.
 
6.   
LM provided
photos of the home, specifically the bedroom and closet which contained
clothing articles belonging to the Landlord.
 
7.   
LM provided
identification for the Landlord showing
the residential address
as the same as the property
identified in this application.
 
8.   
The Tenants in their own evidence
submitted a text message exchange
between the Tenants and the
Landlord where the Landlord states:
 
“I cant even sit in my living room my eyes are watering
and cant breathe
and I want to be able to sleep in the house….”
 
“I’ll not be able to
stay in my house because
of that As I told before and I have pictures of the suitcase full of spices to take it
out of my house And that’s why I asked you to move out You have no
consideration because if u did you will make sure before bringing a suitcase
full of spices to my house you would find
out if they are allergic or not or if they have a problem with it.”
 
“Because of this problem
and I cant live in my house please move out…”
 
“I asked u to move out because sutecase
u brought from India full of spices is making
me sick and now I’m sitting outside because I cant even by n my house..”
 
“Good night I’m sleeping
outside…”
 
9.    Based on the evidence before and on a balance
of probabilities, I find that the Act does not apply as the Tenants share
accommodation with the Landlord, meaning the living accommodation is exempt
from the Act pursuant to s. 5 (1). The Tenants are required to share a bathroom
and kitchen with the owner of the residential premises.
 
10.
This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Act does not
apply.
 
2.   
The Tenants
T2 and T1 applications are dismissed as the Board
lacks jurisdiction in this
matter.
