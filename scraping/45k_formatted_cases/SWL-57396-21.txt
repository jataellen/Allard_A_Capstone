Order under
Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number:
SWL-57396-21




 
In the matter
  of:


 
707, 737 OUELLETTE AVENUE WINDSOR ON N9A6T2


 




Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Carl Jevsnik


Tenant



 
 
 
On December 9, 2021, Skyline Living
(the 'Landlord') applied
in this L4 application for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict Carl Jevsnik (the 'Tenant') and for
an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the consent order issued by the Board
on August 19, 2021 with respect to L1 application SWL- 50976-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The previous consent order
provided that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet
certain condition(s) specified in the consent order.
 
2.       
I find that the Tenant has not met
the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenant has not paid $977.96 rent on or before
December 1, 2021. This was a breach of
paragraph 2 of the consent
order. This L4 application was filed within 30 days of the breach.
 
3.       
The previous L1 application included a request
for an order for the payment
of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the
Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in
addition to eviction, in this L4 application the Landlord is entitled to
request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.       
In paragraph 1 of the consent order,
the Tenant agreed to pay $4,075.80 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's L1 application fee in Order
SWL-50976-21. The Tenant only paid $1,031.12 so the amount
that is still owing from that order is $3,044.68, which is included in this
order. As a result, the previous consent order SWL-50976-21 is cancelled.
 
5.       
Since the date of the order,
the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing.




 
6.       
On January 23, 2018 the Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $977.96
from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.       
Interest on the rent deposit was last paid out to the Tenant up
January 31, 2021. Interest is
owing to the Tenant for the period from February 1, 2021 to January 11, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The previous consent order SWL-50976-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January
22, 2022 (standard 11 days from the issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
If the Tenant made any payments
to the Landlord after this L4 application was filed, those amounts shall be deducted from the
calculations below.
 
4.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $3,044.33*. This amount represents the rent owing up to December 31, 2021 and the costs
related to the application fee for the previous L1 application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord
owes on the rent deposit.
 
5.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$32.15 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 1, 2022 to
the date the Tenant actually moves out of the rental unit or gets evicted.
 
6.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
22, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 23, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 22, 2022, then starting January
23, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 23, 2022.

and the Board will schedule a hearing.
