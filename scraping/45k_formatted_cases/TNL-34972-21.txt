of:


202, 25 BRIDESBURG DRIVE ETOBICOKE ON M9R2K6


 




Between:


Capreit Limited
Partnership


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Barbara Buri


 
                    Tenant



 
 
 
Capreit Limited
Partnership (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Barbara Buri (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 17, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Jason Paine, attended the hearing. As of 11:56 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not
paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from September 1, 2021 to
January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 22, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,465.30 as of January
1, 2022.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,465.30 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period from July 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $5,986.05 after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the




File Number: TNL-34972-21
 
Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 7, 2022.
 
2.    
As of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord
owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears
of rent and compensation the Landlord
is entitled to by $375.18*.
 
3.     However, the Landlord
is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenant: $48.17
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 28, 2022 to
the date the Tenant moves out of the unit, and $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.    
The Landlord
or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 7, 2022, then starting
February 8, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 8, 2022.
 
7.     If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)     $1,456.97 if the payment is made on or before
January 31, 2022,
or
ii)    
$2,922.27 if the payment
is made on or before February 7, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph
and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 8, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
