Order under Section 87(1)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24785-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1502, 181 JOHN STREET N HAMILTON ON L8L7Z7


 




Between:


181 John
Street Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Holly Pennisi


Tenant



 
 
181 John Street Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Holly Pennisi (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 11, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, John Edlund, attended
the hearing. As of 11:21
a.m., the Tenant
was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Preliminary matter:
 
The Landlord sold the building after filing the application but prior to the hearing
taking place. The new Landlord took possession of the
rental complex on October 1, 2021. As a result, the application will only
address outstanding arrears to September 30, 2021 and not termination of the
tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
July 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 21,
2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,350.37.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent
deposit of $1,350.37 from the Tenant. As part of the sale this deposit
has been transferred to the new Landlord and will not be applied
against any amounts owing
here.




File Number: SOL-24785-21
