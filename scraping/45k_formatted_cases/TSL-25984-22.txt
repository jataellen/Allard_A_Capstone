Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-25984-22
 



In the matter
of:


63, 494 AVENUE
ROAD TORONTO ON M4V2J5


 




Between:


Westdale Properties


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Nandita Bhan


Tenant



 
On January 4, 2022, Westdale
Properties (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Nandita
Bhan (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant
gave a notice to terminate
the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant gave the Landlord
a notice to terminate the Tenant's tenancy
effective January 31, 2022.
 
2.     The notice to terminate is invalid because the period
of notice was less than the notice period required by section 44 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’). However, as the Landlord
accepted this notice, the parties in substance reached an agreement to
terminate the tenancy effective January 31, 2022.
 
3.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 31, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022, then starting February
1, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 1, 2022.

The tenant has until January 31, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 77(6) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 31, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.
 
In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on August 1, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before
this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
