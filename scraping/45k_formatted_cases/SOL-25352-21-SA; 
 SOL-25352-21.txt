Tenants



 
 
 
6965083 Canada Inc (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Erik Rynnimeri (ER), Valerio Rynnimeri and Christina Ouellette (CO) (the 'Tenants')
and for an order to have the Tenants
pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the Board on September 14, 2021 with respect to
application SOL-22373-21.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved by order SOL-25352-21, issued on November 19, 2021.
The Tenants filed a motion to set aside order SOL-25352-21.
 
This motion was heard by videoconference on January 19, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s representative S. Guo, the Landlord’s legal
representative M. Zarnett,
and the Tenants ER and CO
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     Order SOL-22373-21 issued September 14, 2021 contains
a condition that the Tenants pay their rent in full and on or before
the first day of each month September 1, 2021 until the arrears are paid off.
 
2.     The Landlord filed an L4 application stating
that the Tenants
failed to pay their full rent for October 2021 on or before October 1,
2021. The Board issued order SOL-25352-21 terminating the tenancy.
 
3.     At the hearing the Tenants ER and CO testified that
they did not breach order SOL- 22373-21. They testified
that on October 1, 2021 they sent the full funds for their rent to a third party rent payment service, Rent
Moola, and that they later found out that those funds were not forwarded to the
Landlord and that they were returned back to the




 
Tenants instead. The Tenants testified that they then paid their rent to
Rent Moolah with a different payment
method several days later and the payment
went through. On cross-
examination, when presented with the Landlord’s evidence that the Tenant’s payment
to Rent Moolah was returned for non-sufficient funds, the Tenants denied
that they had insufficient funds for their rent payment sent on October 1,
2021. However, the Tenants did not file any documentary evidence from their
bank showing that they had sufficient funds at the material time. This evidence
would be easily obtained.
 
4.     Based on the Landlord’s evidence that the payment was
not finalized because of insufficient funds and the Tenants’ lack of evidence
to contradict this, I find, on a balance of
probabilities, that the Tenants did not pay their rent on or before October
1, 2021. They sent a payment to Rent
Moolah that bounced. This is the equivalent of giving a cheque to the Landlord that bounced.
 
5.    
Based on the above, at the hearing I found that the Tenants
breached a condition
of order SOL-22373-21.
 
6.     The last payment
the Tenants have made to the Landlord
was in October 2021. This means they have further breached the
order by not paying rent for November or December 2021 or for January 2022 and by not making
payments toward arrears on November 20 or December 20, 2021.
 
7.     The Tenants testified that ER lost his job on October
12, 2021 and CO lost her job on November 24, 2021. CO also received a severance package
of $9,000.00. ER has a new
job that starts on January 31, 2022 and CO started a new job two or three weeks
before the hearing. The Tenants testified that they stopped paying anything to
the Landlord because they could not afford to pay, although it appears that
through CO’s income they could have paid something toward rent in November and
December and that they also had the $9,000.00 settlement from which they could
have paid rent and arrears. When asked about this the Tenants testified that
they prioritized other obligations.
 
8.    
The Tenants proposed paying off their arrears, which are now nearly double what they were
when they entered
into the consent
order SOL-22373-21, by a payment
plan that would have their
arrears paid off in 18 months.
 
9.     I am not satisfied, having regard to all the circumstances, that it would not be unfair to set
aside the order. The Tenants had an opportunity to demonstrate good faith by
making some payments from November 2021 to the date of the hearing but they did
not. Given their decision to instead prioritize other payments, it would be
unfair to the Landlord to assume that the Tenants would comply with a payment
plan (especially because the order they breached several times was a consent
payment plan).
 
10.  I delivered my decision to deny the Tenants’ motion at
the hearing. When asked how much time they would need to move they said a
couple of weeks. I told the Tenants that the
order would lift the stay on January
31, 2022 or immediately, which
ever date is latest
based on the date this order is issued.
 
It is ordered that:




 
 
 
1.    
The motion to set aside Order
SOL-25352-21, issued on November 19, 2021, is denied.
 
2.     The stay of order SOL-25352-21 is lifted immediately.
