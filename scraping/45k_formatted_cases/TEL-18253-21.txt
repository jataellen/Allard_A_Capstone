and


 




 


Christy Royle
  Mike Royle


Tenants



 
Robin Baranyai (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Christy Royle and Mike
Royle (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord has entered into an agreement of
purchase and sale of the rental unit and the purchaser requires
possession of the rental unit for
the purpose of residential occupation.
 
The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard via video/teleconference on October 19, 2021.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord's Legal Representative and the Tenants
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     This is an application under section 49(1) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act) because the Landlord
has sold the property and the purchaser requires possession of the
rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
2.    
Subsection 49(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2006 (‘the Act’) which states in part:
“a landlord
who has entered into an agreement of purchase and sale (APS) of the residential
complex may, on behalf of the purchaser, give the Tenant of a unit in the
residential complex a notice terminating the tenancy, if the purchaser in good faith requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation
 
3.    
On July 21, 2021 the Landlord gave
the Tenant a (N12) form notice to end the tenancy because the Landlord entered
into an agreement of purchase and sale and the purchaser requires possession of the
rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The termination date in
the (N12) notice was September 30, 2021.
 
4.     The Tenant did not vacate
the rental unit in accordance with the termination date set out in the notice given.




 
5.    
A copy of the Agreement of
Purchase and Sale was submitted confirming that the Landlord has sold the property to the Purchaser. The closing has since been amended
and extended to November 1, 2021.
6.    
The Landlord has filed a
declaration from a Farkas Baranyai, the named Purchaser affirming his good faith intention to move into the property
and occupy it for his personal
residence for a minimum of one year.
7.    
The Landlord's Legal Representative asserts that compensation equal to one month's
rent was paid by etransfer September 30, 2021.
8.    
The technical requirements for granting an application under section 49(1) of the Act are
1)    
The Notice:
 
49(3) The date for termination specified
in a notice given under subsection (1) or (2) shall
be at least 60 days after the notice is given and shall be the day a period of
the tenancy ends or, where the tenancy is for a fixed term, the end of the
term.
 
2)    
Declaration or Affidavit
 
Subsection 72(1) of the Act requires
the Landlord to file an affidavit/declaration sworn by
the person who personally requires the rental unit and that person certifying that they in good faith
requires the rental unit for his or her own personal use for at least one year.
 
3)    
Compensation
 
Section 49.1 (1) states - A landlord shall compensate a tenant
in an amount equal to one
month’s rent or offer the tenant another
rental unit acceptable to the tenant if, [emphasis]
(a)  the landlord
gives the tenant
a (N12) notice of termination of the tenancy
on behalf of a purchaser under subsection 49 (1) or
(2):
Section 55.1 states - If the landlord is required to compensate a tenant
under section 48.1, 49.1, 52, 54 or
55, the landlord shall compensate the tenant no later than on the termination
date specified in the notice of termination of the tenancy given by the landlord under section 48, 49 or
50.
9.    
On the face of the documentary evidence submitted, I find the Landlord has met all the
technical requirements pursuant to section 49 of the Residential Tenancies
Act.
 
10.  The Landlord is seeking termination of the tenancy on or before October
31, 2021.
 
11.  The Tenants sought additional time until the end of the current
school year to move out of
the rental unit. They have three children ages 13, 16 and 20.
 
12.  The Landlord was amicable to extending and postponing the termination date until
November 30, 2021.




 
13.  All in all, after considering all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), I find
that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until November 30, 2021 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act to allow the Tenants
additional time to find alternative accommodation.
 
14.  The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $985.00
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord and shall be applied to the last month of the tenancy.
 
15.  The order contains
all the reasons for the decision within
the order. No other reasons
will be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated, as of November
30, 2021. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$39.78 per day for compensation for the use of the unit to the date the Tenant moves out
of the unit.
 
3.    
If the Tenant have not vacated
the rental unit, then starting
December 1, 2021, the
Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
4.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after December 1, 2021.
