  STEED COURT CAMBRIDGE ON N3E0B5


 




Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Maciej Widz
Madeline Monica Widz Margaret Widz Samantha Paige Broome


Tenants



 
 
 
Ajmer Singh Girn (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Maciej Widz, Madeline
Monica Widz, Margaret Widz and Samantha Paige Broome (the 'Tenants') and for an
order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed to
meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on June 18, 2021 with respect
to application HOL-09747-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants have not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenants
did not pay $850.00 arrears
on or before November 15, 2021. The Tenants also did not pay $2700.00 rent on or
before December 1, 2021.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $12,486.00 for rent arrears
and the costs related to the
Landlord's application fee in Order HOL-09747-21. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $2,836.00 and that amount is included
in this order.
As a result, the previous order HOL-09747-21 is cancelled.




 
5.    
Since the date of the order,
the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became owing.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order HOL-09747-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 21, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $4,923.67.(less
any amounts paid after the application was filed on December
6, 2021.) This
amount represents the rent owing up
to January 10, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$88.77 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 11, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
21, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before January 21, 2022, then starting January
22, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 22, 2022.

The tenant has until January 20, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 20, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on July 22, 2022 if
the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
