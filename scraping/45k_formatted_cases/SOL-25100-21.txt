B, 46 URSULA
AVENUE
ST CATHARINES

Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Cheryl Anne Shelvock


Tenant



 
 
 
Frankie Nassif (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Cheryl Anne Shelvock (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the
residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard via video conference on January 5, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord and the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Josh McDougall
attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord’s L2 application is based on a N5 notice
of termination served on the Tenant on September 14, 2021 with a termination date of
October 9, 2021 based on the
following allegations:
 
•        
Parking more than one vehicle in the rental
complex;
•        
Using the common areas for personal
use.
 
2.    
At the hearing, the Landlord wished
to withdraw his claim
with respect to the Tenant parking more than one motor
vehicle in the complex as the Tenant had complied. I consented to the Landlord’s request.
 
3.     As this was the first N5 notice of termination, the
Tenant had seven days to remedy the situation by removing her personal items
from the common areas at the rental complex. Since the N5 notice of termination was mailed to
the Tenant on September 14, 2021 and
was deemed served September 19, 2021, the remedy period
fell between September 19,




 
2021 through to September
26, 2021.
 
4.     It was the Landlord’s uncontested evidence that the
Tenant did not void the N5 notice of termination with respect to the using the
common areas for personal use; the Landlord inspected the premises at the end
of the voiding period and also as of the date of this hearing and found
that the Tenant had not removed her personal
items from the common areas, it had actually gotten
worse.
 
5.     The Landlord testified that the rental complex
is a fully detached home with one rental
unit in the basement and the other on the upper floor. The Tenant resides in the basement. The Landlord stated that with the Tenant storing personal items
in the common areas, it blocks the entrance to the unit causing a potential health
and safety issue, it is unsightly and contravenes property
standards.
 
6.    
The Landlord stated that at no point during
the tenancy was the Tenant
permitted to store personal items in the common areas.
 
7.    
The Landlord takes the position that by storing
personal items in the common
areas of the rental
unit, the Tenant
has substantially interfered with the Landlord’s lawful rights,
interests and privileges.
 
8.     Section 64 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”)
states:
 
A landlord may give a tenant
notice of termination of the tenancy
if the conduct of the tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the tenant is
such that it substantially interferes with the reasonable enjoyment of the
residential complex for all usual purposes by the landlord or another tenant or
substantially interferes with another lawful right, privilege or interest of
the landlord or another tenant.
 
 
9.     Based on the Landlord’s uncontested evidence before
the Board, I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the Tenant has
substantially interfered with the
Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex by storing
significant amounts of personal belongings and debris in the common areas of the residential complex without the
Landlord’s consent and this constitutes substantial interference with the
Landlord’s legal rights with respect to the residential complex.
 
10.  I note that the N5 notice
was not voided within the seven day voiding period
required by the Act,
as the personal items and debris were not removed within seven days after
September 19, 2021.
 
11.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with section 83 of the Act, including the impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic upon the parties, and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act.
 
12.  This order contains
all of the reasons for this matter and no further reasons
will be issued.




 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant
is denied as long as the Tenant meets the conditions set out
below:
 
(a)  
On or before March 1, 2022, the
Tenant shall remove all personal items being
stored and remove all debris in the common areas of the rental complex;
and
 
(b)   
the Tenant shall ensure that the common areas remain clear of all personal
items and all debris for a period of no less than twelve months.
 
2.    
If the Tenant fails to comply with
any of the conditions in accordance with paragraph 1, the Landlord may apply
under section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord must make the application within 30 days
of a breach of a condition set out in paragraph 1 of this order.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing on or before March 1, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 2, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
