Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57545-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


6, 754
QUEBEC STREET LONDON ON
  N5Y1X1


 




Between:


Dylan McLauchlan


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Brad Maggs


Tenant



 
 
 
On January 11, 2022, Dylan
McLauchlan (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Brad Maggs (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the
Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the
order issued by the Board on December 17, 2021 with respect to application
SWL-53643-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenant
failed to pay the arrears
installment of $1000.00
by January 10, 2022 and also
failed to pay the lawful monthly rent for January 2022 by the due date.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $8,536.00 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
SWL-53643-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $7,836.00
and that amount is included
in this order. As a result,
the previous order SWL-53643-21 is
cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,200.00 from the
Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021 to February 4, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SWL-53643-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 15, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $8,006.20*. (less any amount
paid to the Landlords after this application was filed on January 11, 2022).
This
amount represents the rent
owing up to February 4, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for
the previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes
on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $39.85
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 5, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
15, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 15, 2022, then starting February
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 16, 2022.
