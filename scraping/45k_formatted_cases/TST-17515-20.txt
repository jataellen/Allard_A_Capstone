Landlords



 
 
 
Alexandra Logan (the 'Tenant')
applied for an order determining that Jasvir Rathaur
and Satwinder Rathaur (the 'Landlords') have collected or retained money
illegally.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on October 26, 2021.
The Tenant and the Landlords attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant filed this
application alleging that the Landlord had failed to pay the compensation due when they served an N12 notice of termination on the Tenants.
 
2.    
The Landlord
served on the Tenants an N12 notice of termination for their daughter
to move into on February 7, 2020.
 
3.    
As a result of the notice
the Tenant vacated
the rental unit on March
31, 2020.
 
4.    
It was uncontested that the Landlord
had not paid an amount equal to one months
rent compensation in accordance with s. 48.1 of the Act.
 
5.    
I am satisfied that the Landlords failed to pay the Tenant
compensation for termination of the tenancy, as required by the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act').
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlords shall pay to the Tenant the sum of $1,730.00. This amount represents
$1,730.00 in compensation for moving out.
 
2.    
The Landlords
shall also pay to the Tenant $53.00
for the cost of filing the application.




File Number: TST-17515-20
 
3.    
The total amount the Landlords owe to the Tenant is
$1,783.00.
 
4.    
If the Landlords do not
pay the Tenant the full amount owing by January 16, 2022, the Landlords will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January
17, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the outstanding balance.
 
5.    
The Tenant has the right, at any time,
to collect the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
