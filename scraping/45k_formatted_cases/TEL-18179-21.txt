In the matter
of:


136
  CELESTE DRIVE SCARBOROUGH ON M1E2V1


 




Between:


Marguerite Rodriguez-Quayson


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Seth Asare


Tenant



 
Marguerite
Rodriguez-Quayson (the 'Landlord') applied for
an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Seth Asare
(the 'Tenant') because
the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard via video/teleconference on October 19, 2021.
 
The Landlord,
the Landlord's Legal Representative and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     This is an application under
section 48(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act).
 
2.     Subsection 48(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2006 (‘the Act’) which states in part:
“a landlord
may, by notice, terminate a tenancy if the landlord
in good faith requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation by
(a)  the landlord,
(b)  the landlord’s spouse, or
(c)  a child or parent
of the landlord or the landlord’s spouse.
 
3.     On June 30, 2021 the Landlord served the Tenants
a (N12) Notice to End the Tenancy setting out that the Landlord
requires possession of the rental unit for the following reason.
•        
use by the Landlord.
 
4.     The termination date in the (N12) notice
was August 31, 2021.
5.    
The Tenants did not move out of the rental unit in accordance with the termination date set out in the notice given.
 
6.     The technical requirements for granting an application under section 48 of the Act are




 
(a)  
The Notice:
 
48(2) The date for termination specified in a notice shall be at least 60
days after the notice is given and shall be the day a period of the tenancy ends or,
where the tenancy is for a fixed
term, the end of the term.
(b)  
Declaration or Affidavit
 
Subsection 72(1) of the Act requires
the Landlord to file an affidavit/declaration sworn by
the person who personally requires the rental unit and that person certifying that they in good faith
requires the rental unit for his or her own personal use for at least one year.
(c)  
Compensation
 
Section 48.1 of the Act requires
a landlord who has served a tenant with an N12 notice pursuant to section 48 to pay
compensation to the tenants in an amount equal to one month’s rent.
Section 55.1 of
the Act requires the compensation must be paid no later than on the termination date specified in the N12 notice of termination given
by the Landlord under
section 48.
 
7.     The Landlord's Legal Representative asserted
that the compensation in an amount equal to one month’s rent was provided to
the Tenant by etransfer dated August 28, 2021.
 
8.     On the face of the documentary evidence
submitted, I find the Landlord
has met all the technical
requirements pursuant to section 48 of the Residential Tenancies Act.
 
9.    
The Landlord is seeking
termination of the tenancy on or before October 31,
2021.
 
10.  The Tenants sought
additional time until the end of the year – December 31, 2021.
 
11.  After considering all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), I find that it would be unfair to grant relief from
eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. I also find it would not be
unfair to postpone the eviction until November 30, 2021 to provide the Tenant
the additional time to find alternative accommodation.
 
12.  The order contains
all the reasons for the decision within
the order. No other reasons
will be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated as of November
30, 2021. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$46.02 per day for compensation for the use of the unit to the date the Tenant moves out
of the unit.




 
3.    
If the Tenant has not vacated the
rental unit, then starting December 1, 2021, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction
may be enforced.
 
4.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after December 1, 2021.
 
5.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before November 30, 2021, the Tenant will start
to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from December 1, 2021 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
