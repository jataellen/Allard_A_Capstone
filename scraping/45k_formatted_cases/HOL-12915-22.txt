Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12915-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


12 ANDEAN LANE BARRIE ON L9J0J4


 




Between:


Lynne Cameron Anthony Cameron


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Patricia Seager


Tenant



 
 
 
Lynne Cameron and Anthony Cameron
(the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Patricia
Seager (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
entered into an agreement
to terminate the tenancy
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlords and the Tenant
signed an agreement
to terminate the tenancy as of March 31, 2022.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before March 31, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 31, 2022, then starting
April 1, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after April 1, 2022.
