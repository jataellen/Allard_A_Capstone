Between:                  Peel Housing Corp Op as Peel Living                                    Landlord
 
 
and
 
Katarzyna Stolowska                                                                                                                   Tenant
 
 
 
On January 11, 2022, Peel Housing
Corp Op as Peel Living (the 'Landlord') applied in this L4 application for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Katarzyna Stolowska (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent he owes
because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the consent order
issued by the Board on June 14, 2021 with respect to L1 application
CEL-96639-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The previous consent order provided
that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet
certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I find that the Tenant has not met
the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $400.00 arrears
on or before December 20, 2021. The Tenant did not pay $1,472.00 rent on or before
January 1, 2022. These were breaches of paragraphs 2(a) and 2(b) of the consent
order respectively. This L4
application was filed within 30 days of the breaches.
 
3.       
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$5,548.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order CEL-96639-20. The amount that is still owing from that
order is $2,848.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous consent order CEL-96639-20 is cancelled.




 
5.       
Since the date of the consent
order, the Tenant
has failed to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from June 1,
2021 to January 31, 2022.
 
6.       
On October 21, 2011 the Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $354.28 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being
held by the Landlord.
 
7.       
Interest was last paid out to the Tenant
up to the period ending December
31, 2021. Interest is owing
from January 1, 2022 to the date of this order, January 26, 2022.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.       
The previous consent order CEL-96639-20 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 6, 2022 (standard 11 days from the
issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
If the Tenant made any payments
to the Landlord after this L4 application was filed, those amounts shall be deducted from the
calculations below.
 
4.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $6,856.42*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 31, 2022 and the costs
related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
5.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$48.39 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 1, 2022 to
the date the Tenant actually moves out of the rental unit or gets evicted.
 
6.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
6, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 7, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 6, 2022, then starting February
7, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 7, 2022.
