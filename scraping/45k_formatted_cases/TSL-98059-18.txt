Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-98059-18
 










 
 

C.H.P.L
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict A.F (“AF”)
and C.C (CC”) (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on September 10, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s legal representative, K. A (“KA”), and the Tenant,
CC attended the hearing.
 
Preliminary
Issue:
 
1.   
At the outset of the hearing, it was agreed that the former
Tenant, AF, has now vacated the unit and should not be a party to this
application.   The title of proceeding above has been amended accordingly.
 
 Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from December 1, 2016 to September 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 6, 2018.
 
2.      KA
submitted a summary of the Landlord’s claims to the date of the hearing,
showing a claim for arrears in the amount of $6,711.24 plus the $175.00 filing
fee for a total claim of $6,886.24.  KA requested a standard, voidable order of
termination in this context.
 
3.      CC,
while not challenging the amount of the Landlord’s claim, requested more time
in which to pay the total amount stated in paragraph 2.  He proposed a payment
plan over the next 6 months, starting on September 17, 2018.   Under this
proposal, the details of which were provided at the hearing, the full amount
owing to the Landlord would be paid by early December 2018.
 
4.      CC
testified that he lost his job in November 2017 and just recently got back to
work in September 2018.   He is now working two jobs to attempt to pay the
Landlord its money.  He expressed that while his monthly income is limited to
approximately $3,500.00 per month, he hopes to try to rent the room previously
occupied by AF in order to more quickly get the amount owed.
 
5.      KA
expressed that her client is not interested in the proposed payment plan,
noting that the arrears owed to date are substantial and to defer the required
amounts until December 2018 would be unduly prejudicial to the Landlord.
 
6.      I
agree.  While the CC has made some good faith payments to the Landlord in the
days leading up to the hearing – showing his genuine intention to try to save
the tenancy, the amount owing is substantial.  Further, the amount of CC’s
monthly income indicated at the hearing – on a purely mathematical basis, seems
insufficient to support the payment plan he has proposed.  While I note this
expressed desire to get help to pay the arrears etc. through taking on another
flatmate, at the time of the hearing, no new person had been lined up as of the
hearing date.
 
7.      As
such, based upon the totality of the evidence before me, I am not satisfied, on
a balance of probabilities, that it is realistic or appropriate to order the
payment plan proposed by CC.
 
8.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,952.88 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
9.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from December 2,
2017 to August 6, 2018.
 
10.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
former Tenant, AF, is removed as a party to this application and the title of
proceeding is amended accordingly.
 
2.      Unless
CC voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and CC is
terminated.  CC must move out of the rental unit on or before September 29,
2018.
 
3.      CC
shall pay to the Landlord $6,007.69*, which represents the amount of rent owing
and compensation up to September 18, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.      CC
shall also pay to the Landlord $64.20 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting September 19, 2018 to the date he moves out of the unit.
 
5.      CC
shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.      If
CC does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before September 29,
2018, CC will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated
from September 30, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
7.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before September 29, 2018, then starting
September 30, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after September 30,
2018.
 
9.      If,
on or before September 29, 2018, CC pays the amount of $8,919.38** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and CC could remain in the
unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
10.   CC
may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside
this order if he pays the amount required under that subsection on or after
September 30, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. CC is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
