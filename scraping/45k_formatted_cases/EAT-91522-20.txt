Order under Section 135
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAT-91522-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


701, 85 NORTH
PARK ROAD THORNHILL ON
  L4J0H9


 




Between:


Airyn Lodge


Tenant




 


 
and


 




 


Eliyahu Schneider


Landlord



 
 
 
Airyn Lodge (the 'Tenant') applied for an order determining that Eliyahu Schneider (the 'Landlord') has
collected or retained money illegally (the “T1 application”). The Tenant also applied for an order determining the
Landlord harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with the
Tenant and substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental
unit or residential complex by the Tenant (the “T2 application”).
 
The applications were heard by video conference on January 12, 2022.
 
The Tenant attended the hearing. The Landlord was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with the
notice of hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
T1 Application
 
1.    
The Tenant gave the Landlord a rent deposit
on March 01, 2016 in the amount of
$1380.00 The Tenant vacated
the unit on March 04, 2020. The LMR was applied to the
last month’s rent however the Landlord did not pay the Tenant any interest.
 
2.     The Landlord failed to pay the Tenant interest on the rent deposit
as required by s. 106(6)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). The Tenant is entitled to interest on the
LMR, for the period of March 01, 2016 until January 31, 2022, calculated as
follows:
 



2016


2% (10 months)


$23.00




2017


1.5%


$20.70




2018


1.8%


$24.84







 
 



2019


1.8%


$24.84




2020


2.2%


$30.36




2021


1.5%


$20.70




2022


1.2% (1month)


$1.38



 
The Total owing the Tenant under this section
is $145.82.
 
 
3.     I am satisfied, based on the reasoning in 626114
Ontario Ltd. v. Tirado, [2005] O.J. No. 4350 (Div. Ct.), that I have the
authority to award the Tenant interest going back to when
she first provided the Landlord with the rent deposit.
 
 
T2 Application
 
4.    
The Tenant’s T2 application alleges the Landlord
did not give her a N12 notice
of termination.
 
5.     There is nothing in the Act that requires a
Landlord to give the Tenant a notice of termination. Accordingly, I find that the Tenant has failed to establish that the Landlord substantially interfered with
the Tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit.
 
6.     The T2 application is dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord shall pay to the Tenant the sum of
$145.82. This amount represents interest owing on the last month's rent deposit
from March 01, 2016 until
January 31, 2022.
 
2.     The Landlord shall also pay to the Tenant $53.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
3.     The total amount
the Landlord owes to the Tenant is $198.82
 
4.     If the Landlord does not pay the Tenant the full
amount owing by January 31, 2022, the Landlord
will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 01, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
 
5.     The Tenant has the right,
at any time, to collect
the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
