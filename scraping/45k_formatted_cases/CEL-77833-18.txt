Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 










 
 
 

UA (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict BKB (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (L1).
UA (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict BKB (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord in
a residential complex that has three or fewer residential units; and because
the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex has seriously impaired the safety of any
person. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date (L2).
Both applications
were heard in Mississauga on August 14, 2018.
The Landlord and the
Tenant attended the hearing. The Landlord’s daughter, SA and witness, MN also
attended the hearing. The Tenant’s friend and witness, HJ was also present.
Determinations and
reasons:
L2 Application
1.      The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant commenced on March 30, 2018. The rental unit is in
the basement of the home and the Landlord resides upstairs.
 
2.      On June 18, 2018, the
Landlord served the Tenant with an Notice to End your Tenancy For Causing
Serious Problems in the Rental Unit or Residential Complex (N7) alleging that
the Tenant was verbally aggressive on a few occasions and threatened to kill
the Landlord.
 
3.      The Landlord stated
at the hearing that the incident that the N7 states occurred on May 17, 2018 in
fact took place on May 20, 2018.
 
4.      The Landlord alleged
that on May 8, 2018, the Tenant’s cable was not working so he got mad and
started banging on the door violently, yelling and swearing that the Landlord
deliberately turned it off.
 
5.      The Landlord also
alleged that on May 20, 2018 the Tenant became aggressive, because the
Landlord’s witness, MN wanted to use the laundry which is located in the
basement. The Landlord was surprised at the Tenant’s attitude because there was
an agreement for the laundry to be done every Sunday and it was a Sunday. The Tenant
denied this stating it was a Thursday.
 
6.      The Landlord also
gave evidence that on June 11, 2018 the Tenant became aggressive when asked why
the rent was not paid yet. According to the Landlord, he threatened to kill her
if she kept bothering him and this led to her calling the police who arrested
the Tenant. The Landlord was advised not to contact the Tenant anymore. 
 
7.      The Tenant denied
being verbally aggressive insisting that the Landlord called the police just to
get him in trouble and he did not threaten her.
 
8.      Section 66 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”) sets out “serious impairment of
safety” as a ground for termination of a tenancy.  This section allows a
Landlord to give a short 10-day notice, without giving the Tenant an
opportunity to rectify the problem.  The evidence of the Landlord is that the
Tenant was verbally abusive and aggressive and he threatened to kill her.
Although the Tenant was arrested by the police, he was granted bail the next
day and allowed to return back to the rental unit.
 
9.      Based on the evidence
before me, I am not satisfied that the Tenant impaired the safety of the
Landlord or any other person in the premises. As abhorrent as verbal abuse and
bullying may be, they do not amount to an impairment of safety. 
 
10.   I prefer the evidence
of the Landlord which was consistent throughout her testimony with respect to the
exchanges between the parties and find that the Tenant was verbally abusive towards
the Landlord on several occasions. The Tenant’s conduct substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlord
 
11.   However, I have
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it
would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s)
set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
L1 Application
12.   The Tenant has not
paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from June 1,
2018 to August 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice
of Termination effective July 21, 2018.
 
13.   The monthly rent is
$1,000.00.
 
14.   The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,000.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
15.   Interest on the rent
deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 8, 2018 to July 21,
2018.
 
16.   The Tenant gave
evidence that he tried to pay the rent on June 8, 11 and 13, 2018 but the
Landlord refused to accept the rent. The Tenant’s witness testified that he was
waiting outside when the Tenant tried to pay the rent on June 8 and 20, 2018
but the Landlord did not accept it. The Landlord’s evidence is that on June 8,
2018 the Tenant called while she was in the hospital with her son explaining
that the rent will be late that month. On June 11, 2018, he threatened to kill
her when she asked for the rent and on June 13, 2018 was verbally abusive
towards her but never offered to pay the rent.
 
17.   Based on the evidence
before me, I am not convinced that the Tenant offered to pay the rent and the
Landlord refused to accept it. The Landlord’s testimony was consistent with the
information on her application that she was threatened when she asked for the
rent on June 11, 2018. Furthermore, it is not disputed that the rent in arrears
was in fact never received by the Landlord.
 
18.   I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. 
It is ordered that:
 
L1 Application
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before September 7, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,901.79*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to August 27, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $32.88 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting August 28, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If the
Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before September
7, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from September 8, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.      If the
unit is not vacated on or before September 7, 2018, then starting September 8,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after September 8,
2018.
 
8.      If the
Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay
to the Landlord or to the Board in trust: 
i)        $3,190.00 if the payment is made on or before August 31, 2018, or
ii)       $4,190.00 if the payment is made on or before September 7, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after September 8, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
L2 Application
 
10.   If the
Tenant is able to void the L1 portion of this order by paying all the arrears,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant shall continue.
 
11.   The
Tenant shall desist from yelling and swearing at the Landlord in any manner for
a period of one year from the date of this order.
 
12.   If the
Tenant fails to meet the condition set out in paragraph 11, the Landlord may
apply under section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and
evicting the Tenants.  The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of
a breach of a condition set out in paragraphs 11 of this order.
