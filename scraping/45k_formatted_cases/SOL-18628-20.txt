Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-18628-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


404,
  130 ST PAUL AVE BRANTFORD ON N3T4G2


 




Between:


Equiton Residential Income Fund LP


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Karen Vaters


Tenant



 
 
 
Equiton
Residential Income Fund LP (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Karen Vaters (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed
administration charges related to NSF cheques.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 8, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s
Legal Representative, Daniel Abraham, attended the hearing. As of 11:44 a.m., the Tenant was not
present nor represented although properly served a Notice of Hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period from September
1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective November
24, 2020.
 
2.    
The Landlord incurred charges of
$40.00 for administration charges related to cheques tendered by or on behalf
of the Tenant, which were returned NSF.
 
3.    
The lawful monthly rent to December
31, 2022 was $1,350.00.
 
4.     The Landlord served the Tenant with a valid N1 Notice
of Rent Increase on or about October 1, 2021 where the lawful monthly rent
would increase to $1,366.20 effective January 1, 2022.
 
5.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,350.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period from March 15, 2020 to December 31, 2020.




File Number: SOL-18628-20
 
 
 
7.    
The Tenant paid $4,750.00
after the application was filed.
 
8.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant
voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit
on or before February 26, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $15,762.65*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February 15,
2022 and the total charges related to NSF cheques tendered to the Landlord by
or on behalf of the Tenant, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $44.92 per day for
compensation for the use of the unit
starting February 16, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before February 26, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe
interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 27, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 26, 2022, then starting
February 27, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord, on or after February 27, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 26, 2022, the Tenant pays the
amount of $17,258.40** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for
eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after
February 27, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
