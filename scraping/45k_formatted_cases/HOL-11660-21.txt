Donna Mcquade
  Shaun Warren


Tenants



 
 
 
Ashwin Mathur (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Donna Mcquade and Shaun
Warren (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for personal
use The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on February
1, 2022. The Landlord,
represented by Darlene Mezzbotta and the Tenant Shaun Warren, attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,900.00
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
2.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from November
15, 2017 to August 31, 2021
 
3.     The Landlord paid the Tenant compensation equal
to one month's rent.
 
4.     The Tenant agrees
the Landlord in good faith
wants to move into the rental unit.
 
5.     The Tenant has not paid rent or utilities for one year.
 
6.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until February 21, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act as
agreed to by the Landlord.
