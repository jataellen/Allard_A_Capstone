Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-46755-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


A, 43 ADELAIDE STREET
S LONDON ON N5Z3K1


 




Between:


Julia Orozco-barrera
  Max Litt


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Emily Nolan


Tenant



 
 
 
Julia Orozco-barrera and Max Litt
(the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Emily Nolan (the 'Tenant') because
the Landlord requires the rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation. The Landlords also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on June 14, 2021.
The Landlords and the Tenant attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlords paid the Tenant
compensation equal to one month's
rent and the Tenant
has cashed the cheque of $1,450.00 received from the Landlord.
 
2.     The Landlords in good faith requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
3.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
the Act. The Landlords made reasonable efforts to accommodate the Tenant by
offering to move in the house that he currently resides with his family. The
Landlord submitted that the reason he requires the rental unit is because his
current house is too small for him, his wife, his two under-age children and extended family,
nephew, who stays with them often. I found the Landlord to be credible and I accept his evidence
that he genuinely requires the rental unit for his family for the purpose of
residential occupation for minimum one year. The Tenant submitted that she did
not want to move at the house suggested by the Landlord, because she thought
that it had mold. The Tenant testified that she maintained that position even
after the Landlord assured her that he had rectify the mold problem. The

Tenant simply did not believe the
Landlord and made no effort to find out if the mold problem was in fact
rectified as stated by the Landlord. The Tenant submitted that the Landlord wants to evict her to rent the unit at a higher
price. However, the Tenant did not
provide evidence to substantiate this allegation. I have no reason to deny the
eviction requested by the Landlords.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated, as of
February 3, 2022. The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before February 14, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $47.67
per day for compensation for the
use of the unit from February 4, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount
owing on or before February
14, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 15, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 14, 2022, then starting
February 15, 2022, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after February 15, 2022.
