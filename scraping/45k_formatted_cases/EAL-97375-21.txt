In the matter
of:


1401 PALMERSTON DRIVE OTTAWA ON K1J8N9


 




Between:


Stanley Loiselle


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Darin Gadjansky Jamie St. Michael Jessie
  St. Michael


Tenants



 
 
 
Stanley Loiselle
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Darin Gadjansky, Jamie St. Michael and
Jessie St. Michael (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord requires possession of
the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021 at 12:02 PM.
 
The Landlord
and the Tenants,
Darin Gadjansky, attended
the hearing. The Landlord was represented by Trevor Jacquard. Simon Loiselle provided testimony for the
Landlord.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
For the reasons set out below, I find that
the Landlords in good faith require possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation by his child. Therefore, the tenancy is terminated effective May 31,
2022.
 
2.    
On July 30, 2021,
the Landlord served
the Tenants with an N12 notice of termination
seeking termination of the tenancy for the purpose of residential occupation by
the Landlords. The termination date set out in the N12 notice is September 30,
2021.
 
3.    
The Landlord
paid the Tenant
compensation equal to one month's
rent on August 5, 2021.
 
Good Faith
 
4.    
The N12 was served pursuant to section 48 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
“Act”). Section 48(1) requires that, in order to be successful in this
application, the Landlords must establish that at the time of the service
of the N12 Notice, they required, in good faith, the unit for
residential use for a period of at least one year.




 
 
 
5.    
In Feeney v. Noble,
1994 CanLII 10538 (ON SC), the Court held that the test of good faith is
genuine intention to occupy the premises and not the reasonableness of the
Landlord’s proposal. This principle
was upheld in Salter v. Beljinac 2001 CanLII 40231 (ON SCDC) where the Court held that the “good faith”
requirement simply means that the
Landlord sincerely intends to occupy the rental unit. The Landlord may also
have additional motives for selecting a particular rental unit, but this does
not affect the good faith of the Landlord’s notice.”
 
6.    
The Landlord’s son,
Simon Loiselle, swore an affidavit that was submitted to the Board confirming
that he intends in good faith to occupy the rental unit for a period of at
least one year. In oral testimony, he
indicated that he is currently attending the University of Ottawa, and
commuting from his parents’ home in Orleans.
The rental unit is located much more conveniently to the university, and
he intends to occupy it both for the duration
hf his current academic programme (which will finish
in the spring of 2023),
after which he intends to enrol in the same university’s teacher’s
programme.
 
7.    
The Tenants offered a
mix of speculation and hearsay to suggest that the real reason for the
termination of the tenancy was that their rent is low, the tenancy having
started in 2001 and therefore being substantially below current market rents. I cannot find that this is sufficient to make
a finding of lack of good faith on the Landlord’s part, as the essential test as noted above is the
genuineness of the Landlord’s intention. In
this case, the Landlord’s intention is to move his son into the rental unit,
which is more conveniently located near his university. I find the Landlord’s son to be forthright and credible in his
testimony, and therefore find on a balance of probabilities that he genuinely
intends to occupy the rental
unit. The Tenants
also queried what one student
might do with a three- bedroom rental unit. The Landlord’s son indicated that he had
not decided whether to have roommates. I
do not consider that the possible future presence of roommates undermines the
good faith intention to occupy within the current statutory framework of
section 48.
 
8.    
I therefore
find that the Landlord in good faith requires the rental unit for
residential purposes for a period of at least one year.
 
Relief from eviction
 
9.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until May 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
10.  The Tenants noted
that they have been looking
for a new rental unit, with some difficulty: the
tenancy started 20 years ago, and with guideline increases since then the rent
now stands at $1,200, whereas comparable market rent is $2,200. Both Tenants have some financial obstacles
to finding a new rental unit in their price range, and suggested that they may
need until May 2022 to find a new place.
 
11.  The Landlord suggested
a termination date of the end of April 2022 would be
workable.




 
12.  Having regard to the fact that the parties are a month
apart, and that the Landlord’s son has alternate accommodation whereas the Tenants to not, I
must accept the Tenants’ requested termination date. While the current arrangements of the Landlord’s son may be inconvenient for the additional month, that inconvenience does not in my view rise to the level of unfairness.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated, as of
May 31, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
May 31, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before May 31, 2022, then starting June 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after June 1, 2022.
