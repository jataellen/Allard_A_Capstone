M.L.M.I. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict M.H.K. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did
not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. (L1 application)
 
M.L.M.I. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict M.H.K. (the 'Tenant') as the Tenant has
persistently paid the rent late. The Landlord also claimed compensation for
each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date. (L2
application)
 
This application was heard in Toronto on May 17, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 application
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent he was required to pay for the period from March 1, 2018 to May 31,
2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
March 25, 2018.
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,249.72 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2018 to March 25, 2018.
4.     
The Tenant paid $2,500.00
after the application was filed.
5.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
L2 application:
 
1.     
The Tenant has persistently failed to pay the
rent on the date it was due. According to the Landlord’s ledger sheet the
Tenant paid his rent late 12 times over a 12 month period. 
2.     
I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it
would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the conditions
set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
L1 application:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before June 4,
2018.
2.     
As of the date of this
order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the Landlord is
entitled to by $281.66*.
3.     
However, the Landlord is
authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the Landlord owes
the Tenant:
$41.09 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting May 25, 2018
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit, and $190.00 for the cost of
filing the application.
4.     
The Landlord or the Tenant
shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
5.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 4, 2018, then starting June 5, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
6.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 5, 2018.
7.     
If the Tenant wishes to
void this order and continue the tenancy, he must pay to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust:
i)        $1,419.82 if the payment is made on or before May 31, 2018, or
ii)       $2,669.54 if the payment is made on or before June 4, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after June 5, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
L2
application
9.     
If the Tenant voids the
eviction order for non-payment of rent pursuant to paragraph 7 or 8 above then
the Tenant shall pay to the Landlord new rent on time and in full for the
period commencing June 1, 2018 to May 31, 2019. 
10.  
If the Tenant fails to make
any one of the payments in accordance with paragraph 10 of this order the
Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to the Board pursuant to
section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenant and requiring that the Tenants pay any new arrears, NSF fees and related
charges that became owing after May 31, 2018.
