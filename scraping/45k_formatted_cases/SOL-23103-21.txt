69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-23103-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


123 DENNIS DRIVE SMITHVILLE ON L0R2A0


 




Between:


Zaka Ullah


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Damion Douglass Lorraine Douglass


Tenants



 
 
 
Zaka Ullah (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Lorraine Douglass and Damion
Douglass (the 'Tenants') because they have been persistently late in paying their rent. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on January 5, 2022.
The Landlord’s agent, M. Gullraiz, and the Tenant, D. Douglass, attended
the hearing. D. Douglass stated
he was appearing on behalf of L. Douglass. L. Douglass was not present
at the hearing although properly
served with notice of this
hearing by the Board. D. Douglass had an opportunity to speak with Tenant Duty
Counsel before the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
M. Gullraiz
signed the application and appeared at the hearing
as the Landlord’s friend. M. Gullraiz is a real estate
agent/realtor.
 
2.     Section
185 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), provides that:
 
185 (1) An application shall be filed with the Board in the form approved by the
Board, shall be accompanied by the prescribed information and shall be signed
by the applicant.
 
(2) An applicant may give written
authorization to sign an application to a person representing the applicant
under the authority of the Law Society Act and, if the applicant
does so, the Board may require such representative to file
a copy of the authorization.
 
3.    
As I stated at the hearing,
the Landlord’s application must be dismissed
as the application was invalid as it was not signed by the Landlord,
instead it was signed by M. Gullraiz. As




File Number: SOL-23103-21
 
M. Gullraiz was
not representing the Landlord under the authority of the Law Society Act,
he had no authority to sign the application.
 
4.     Based on the above, there was
no valid application before the Board.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord's application is dismissed.
