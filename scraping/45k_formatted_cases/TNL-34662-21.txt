Between:

and


 




 


Ayobami Olusakin


Tenant



 
 
 
Capreit Limited Partnership (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ayobami
Olusakin (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on December 13, 2021.
Only the Landlord’s Legal
Representative, Jason Paine, attended the hearing. As of 2:38 p.m., the Tenant
was not present or represented at the hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from June 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective August 30, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,909.12.
 
4.     The Tenant paid all arrears
for the period ending
December 31, 2021 after the application
was filed.
 
5.    
The only amount outstanding is part of the Landlord's cost of filing
the application. As a
result, the order will be limited to costs only and not eviction.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the
Landlord $49.84 for the remaining
cost of filing
the application.




File Number: TNL-34662-21
 
2.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before
February 7, 2022, the Tenant will
start to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
