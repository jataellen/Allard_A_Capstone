Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-02913-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


BASEMENT, 88 HUDSON
DRIVE BRAMPTON ON L6Y4K8


 




Between:


Harminder Singh


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jasmine White
  Kevin Ishmael


Tenants



 
 
 
Harminder Singh (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kevin Ishmael and Jasmine White (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants, another occupant
of the rental unit or someone
they permitted in the residential complex have substantially interfered with
the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord
or another tenant.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 956 0593 7653#
on January 27, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s representatives Ibifiri Fabian and Harpeet Singh attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants live in the basement unit of the home. A family lives on the main floor. The main floor tenants have complained weekly
that the Tenants
continually obstruct the main
floor tenants from using the laundry facility, which is located in the common
area. The Tenants use racial slurs
against the main floor tenants, constantly yell at them and make excessive
noise including loud music.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s legal
representative submits that when she served the notice on the Tenants, she also attempted to discuss the rent the Tenants owe, she was told “we’ll
see you in court”.
The Tenants moved into the unit on June 1, 2021, paid first and last month rent, plus one other month. They have since stopped paying rent.
 
3.     I find the Tenants have substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of
another tenant.
 
4.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,600.00
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.




File Number: CEL-02913-21
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from June 1, 2021 to September 22, 2021
 
6.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated, as of February
11, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 11, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlord $5,290.10, which represents compensation for the use of the
unit from September 23, 2021 to January 31, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$52.60 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from February 1, 2022 to
the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February 11, 2022, they will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 12, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 11, 2022, then starting February
12, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 12, 2022.
