611, 95 GAMBLE
AVENUE TORONTO ON M4K2H7


 




Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Alicia Christine Taylor Anastasia Lillian Kerlow


Tenants



 
 
 
Q Res V Operating LP (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Alicia Christine Taylor and Anastasia Lillian Kerlow (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
12, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Bryan Rubin, attended the hearing. As of 10:33 a.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective September 2, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,735.00.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,735.00
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 1, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $9,753.84*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 18, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $57.04
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 19,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before March 1, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from March 2,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 1, 2022, then starting
March 2, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 2, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$12,331.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022, or
ii)             
$14,066.00 if the payment
is made on or before
March 1, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not make full
payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline,
then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March 2, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once
during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
February 18, 2022
