Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44043-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


1, 169 HURON
  STREET
SAULT STE. MARIE
ON P6A1R2


 




Between:


12951274 Canada Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Karen
Couture Ray Couture


Tenants



 
 
 
12951274 Canada
Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Ray Couture and Karen Couture
(the 'Tenants') because
they, another occupant
of the rental unit or
someone they permitted in the residential complex have substantially interfered
with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlord or another tenant. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the
unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 988 4914 7021# on January
10, 2022. The Landlord
Matthew Moxness represented by Jane Dean, and witness for the Landlord Laura
Ortega, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
There have been repeated
incidents of fighting, yelling and screaming, throwing things
around and disturbing the neighbours.
 
2.    
The Tenant has been
observed with a weapon and the witness has heard gunshots. According to a complaint
from a neighbour the Tenant was removed
in handcuffs by the
police.
 
3.    
The Tenant has been seen by the witness
wielding a knife and there are bullet holes in the door frame of the rental unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
guests have broken
into a shed and items were stolen.
 
5.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
