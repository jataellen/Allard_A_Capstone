Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-13505-19 &

AS and RS (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict DM, TM
and SW (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
The Landlords also applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
the Tenants because the Tenants, another occupant of
the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlords or another tenant; and because the
Tenants, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in
the residential complex has caused wilful or negligent undue damage in the
rental unit or the residential complex. The Landlords have also applied for an order requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlords for the damage.
 
This application was heard in Toronto
on February 14, 2020,
and by video conference on September 13, 2020, May 25, 2021, and
January 13, 2022.
 
The Landlords
and the Tenants attended the hearings. The Landlords’ legal representative, K.F attended the hearings on February 14 and September
13, 2020, and May 25, 2021, and the
Landlords’ legal representative V. R attended
the hearing on January 13, 2022.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
This matter involves four applications; L1 and L2 Landlord applications, and T2 and T6 Tenant applications.




 
2.   
The rental unit is a two-storey
house with a basement. There were
eight people living in the house, including (SW), SW’s three adult children,
two of whom are named Tenants, and four minor children.
 
3.   
The Tenants moved into the rental
unit in June 2016, and they moved
out on October 14, 2019.
 
4.   
The Landlords are seeking arrears
of rent and compensation for extensive damage allegedly caused by the Tenants. The Tenants are seeking an abatement of rent for the alleged Landlords’ breach of their
maintenance obligations.
 
L1 Application:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from January 15, 2019 to October
14, 2019. Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination.
 
2.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $2,370.70 from the Tenants and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
3.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from June 16, 2015 to
October 14, 2019.
 
4.     The Tenants did not dispute
the arrears owed to October
14, 2019, the date
they moved out of the rental
unit.
 
5.     The Landlords’ rent ledger showed that the Tenants
paid the rent in full to March 14, 2019. They therefore
owed rent for two months at the rate of $2,370.70 per month, and for the following five months at a
monthly rent of $2,413.37.
 
6.     The Landlords are seeking a further 60 days of rent
pursuant to subsection 88(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’), after the Tenants vacated the rental unit, because they allege that the Tenants
did not provide any notice of their intention to leave.
The Tenants deny that they owe rent for a further 60 days.
 
7.     Subsection 88(1) entitles a Landlord to claim rent for
the period that ends on the earliest termination date that could have been
specified in a notice of termination had the tenant, on the date that the landlord
knew or ought to have known that the tenant
had abandoned or vacated the
rental unit, given notice of termination in accordance with the Act. However,
the provision is only applicable if the tenant vacates a rental unit when the
landlord has not given a notice of termination.
 
8.    
The Landlords
had undeniably served
the Tenants with a notice of termination, so it is before me to determine whether section
88 is applicable in this case.




 
 
9.    
The Landlords said that the Tenants
gave no notice
at all to the Landlord
prior to moving out on October 14, 2019. The Tenants said that they gave notice to
the Landlords, but they had no documentary evidence of this notice. I find, on a balance of probabilities,
that the Tenants did not provide any advance notice of their intention to vacate the rental
unit on October 14, 2019.
 
10.  Although the Tenants had been served two notices of
termination, I find that they ultimately left because they had not been paying
rent for over half a year, and they had no intention of paying further
rent. The notices
of termination had termination dates that
were at least nine months
prior to the date the Tenants, in fact, moved out. They stayed
in the rental unit for a further seven months without paying any rent at all,
and then they left the rental unit without giving notice, and they left
considerable damage.
 
11.  Consequently, I find
that the Landlords are entitled to request rent pursuant to subsection
88(1) on the basis that the Tenants
did not leave on
the termination date,
and they stayed over six
months longer, before leaving without communicating to the Landlords their
intention to depart.
 
12.  The Landlords, however, also had an obligation to
mitigate their losses pursuant to section 16 of the Act. They did not re-rent the unit for months after the Tenants left.
They said it was because
of the damaged state of the unit,
and the need for extensive repairs.
 
13.  I find that it is not reasonable for the Landlords to have been able to re-rent the rental unit on November 1, 2019, considering
the lack of notice given by the
Tenants, as well as the damage. The
Landlords did not provide evidence of mitigation that explained why it would
take an extra 60 days from October 14, 2019, to re-rent the unit. However, I find that it is reasonable to
conclude that the Landlords would not have been able to rent the rental unit
until at least December 1, 2019, the beginning of a new rental period.
Therefore, I have calculated the arrears to November 30, 2019.
 
L2 Application:
 
14.  The Landlords served an N5 notice of termination on the Tenants
for failing to pay utilities bills, and for causing
extensive damage to the rental unit.
 
15.  The Tenants deny that
they caused wilful or negligent damage that is beyond wear and tear.
They have also filed a T6 application on February 20, 2020, alleging maintenance breaches by the Landlords, and
for which they claim a rent abatement.
 
16.  It is undisputed that the Tenants caused damage by
denting the wall in the small, third bedroom.
It was also undisputed that there was damage caused
to windows, and there was a scorch mark in a basement
closet caused by the Tenants’ candle smoke.




 
17.  The Landlords allege that there was damage to walls,
windows, floors, toilet, doors, kitchen cabinets, blinds, light fixtures,
carpet on stairs. The Landlords also
allege that they had to replace a washing machine, dryer, fridge, kitchen range hood, and bath fan.
 
18.  The Landlords also allege that the damage
caused by the Tenants leaving
garbage lying around outside
the property necessitated a pest control treatment, for which they had a
receipt dated November 9, 2019, in the amount of $395.50.
 
19.  The parties disputed
a $35.00 repair
to the thermostat that the Landlords carried
out in 2018.
 
20.  Besides the undisputed damage, listed above, the
Tenants allege that all the damage claimed by the Landlords is normal wear and
tear. For example, they said that the
kitchen cupboards were not in a good condition when they moved into the rental unit, and
that the stove was old when they arrived. The
Tenants said the carpet on the stairs was only a little dirty from use when
they moved out, and whatever damage the Landlords claim with regard to the
wooden floors was also wear and tear that could have been repaired.
 
21.  The Tenants said that the patch of floor in the
utility room was damaged due to water running
out of the furnace. They said that the bathroom
mirror was chipped
when they moved in. They also said that they purchased all the
blinds except for those in the bedroom.
 
22.  The Tenants took a video of the rental unit as they
were moving out, which they said proves all the repairs that they carried
out, as well as proving
that the Landlords’ claimed damage was wear and tear.
Reasons and Analysis for Landlords’ Damage
Application:
23.  It is before me to determine what damage has been
proved by the Landlords, and whether some of the damage is normal
wear and tear, or whether
it is negligent or wilful damage caused by the Tenants.
 
24.  In the photos taken by the Landlords in May, 2019, it
is evident that there is extensive damage that goes beyond wear and tear. In particular, the photos prove,
on a balance of probabilities, that the damage
to doors, walls,
windows and floors was not mere wear and tear.
 
25.  The Tenants repeated that there were eight people living in the rental unit, four of whom were
adults, and four children. Based on
the photographic evidence, and based on the Tenants’ own insistence on the hard wear caused
by eight people, it was not merely
that there were eight people living in the house that caused more than
normal wear and tear damage. It is
evident from the photos that the damage was caused because there were
eight people, including children, that took little
care in treating
the Landlords’ property
with respect.




 
26.  There were kitchen cabinet facings that were ripped
out, windows that had been smashed, walls and door frames
smashed or dented,
a toilet chipped, floors damaged beyond what would be caused by cleaning products, as
claimed by the Tenants.
 
27.  The Landlords had photos of the rental unit just prior
to the Tenants moving in. The photos show that
the rental unit was in a pristine
condition, it had all cupboards, floors and walls intact, including the
bathroom mirror that the Tenants deny was cracked by them.
 
28.  The Tenants’ video shows that the Tenants had repaired
light fixtures and light switches prior to moving out, so the Landlords will
not get compensation for these. The
Tenants’ video, which pans round each room very quickly and superficially, does
not disprove the Landlords’ allegations with respect to floors, walls,
appliances, windows, doors, kitchen cabinets,
bathroom or toilet.
These all suffered
damage that went beyond wear and tear, and I find that the damage was
wilful or negligent.
 
29.  The Landlords had photos of damage to the appliances, like the fridge.
They also alleged that toys and other objects had
been stuffed in to the washing machine, dryer and toilet, and their plumbing
receipts attested to it as well. The
Tenants were negligent in their treatment of the Landlords’ property, and I find,
on a balance of probabilities, that damage to the washing machine, dryer, fridge and toilet
went beyond wear and tear, and was caused by the negligence of the Tenants.
 
30.  The Landlords’ photos
upon moving in do not show
any blinds in the kitchen,
and therefore they cannot obtain compensation for replacing those.
 
31.  It is before me to determine whether the staining on
the carpet went beyond wear and tear. Carpets are very susceptible to wear and tear, and I find that the Landlords did not
prove, on a balance of probabilities, that it was necessary to replace the stairway carpet. They could have cleaned it, and
this would have been necessary at the end of any tenancy.
 
32.  Consequently, I find that the Landlords proved, on a
balance of probabilities, that the Tenants caused extensive negligent or
wilful damage to the rental unit and the residential
complex, including windows,
floors, walls, doors, kitchen cabinets, some blinds, bathroom
mirror, toilet, vanity, and appliances.
 
 
Tenants’ T2 and T6 Applications:
T2 Application:
33.  The Tenants’ T2 application alleged substantial interference
with their reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit and the residential complex,
as well as harassment, coercion, obstruction, threat or
interference. However, the reasons
and details all related to allegations of maintenance breaches, except for an
allegation that the Landlords refused to fill out a reference for them.




 
 
34.  The Tenants did not provide
any evidence about
the latter allegation related to the reference.
 
35.  The Tenants later filed a T6 application for the alleged
maintenance breaches.
 
36.  Consequently, the Tenants’
T2 application will be dismissed.
 
T6 Application:
37.  The Tenants filed a T6 application on February 20, 2020. Most of their maintenance
allegations related to events that occurred prior to February
21, 2019, and they were therefore time-barred pursuant to
subsection 29(2) of the Act.
 
38.  The Tenants allege
that the Landlords
refused to fix the toilets
until the date they vacated the rental unit. They said that it had stopped flushing
properly in 2018. SW said that every
one had to put their feces in bags to be thrown out, and they had to remove
their urine manually, because nothing would flush.
 
39.  SW said that she told the Landlords about
this problem “every chance”
she got. She said
that the Landlords sent someone
to fix it in 2018,
but only one of the toilets was fixed, and the plumber blamed them for too many
people using the other toilet. She
said that whatever was fixed was temporary, and the problems kept recurring
until they left.
 
40.  SW said that she had a series
of emails and texts to the Landlords asking them to repair
the issue. She said that she told
them in person on January 17, 2019, and on May 25, 2019, when the Landlords
came to inspect the rental unit.
 
41.  SW admits that the relationship with the Landlords
broke down in at the beginning of 2019, when the Tenants stopped paying the
rent, and the Tenants did not mention the problem again after that. The Tenants request a 100% rent abatement
for three months for having to manually dispose
of their human waste because
the toilet did not flush for
all of 2019.
Reasons and Analysis for Tenants’ Maintenance Application:
 
42.  Pursuant to section
20 of the Act, Landlords are responsible for maintenance of the rental unit. However, as set out in the Landlord and Tenant Board’s
Interpretation Guideline 5, it is established law that it is not sufficient to
establish that there was a maintenance issue.
The Board must also consider whether the Landlord’s response, once
informed of the issue, was timely, appropriate and effective to remedy the problem. Where this
is the case, the Landlord cannot be said to have been in breach of their section 20
obligation to maintain.
 
43.  The Tenants did not have any documentary evidence of
alerting the Landlords to a problem with the toilet after the email
conversation they had in 2018. There
was nothing from the year before
they filed their maintenance application. In fact, they admit that they




 
did not inform the Landlords
about any maintenance problems as of February 2019, because of the breakdown
of the relationship. This was exactly
the year before they filed their application. Therefore, the Tenants have not provided
proof, on a balance of probabilities, that the Landlords were aware of any
issue with the toilet that they could repair.
 
44.  However, in addition,
the Landlords had evidence of correspondence with the Tenants about the toilet in 2018, in which
it appears, on a balance of probabilities, that the Landlords had to carry out a number of repairs to the toilet because the Tenants
were throwing objects in the toilet that were clogging it, and this was causing
repeated plumbing problems.
 
45.  Consequently, I find,
on a balance of probabilities, that the Tenants
have failed to prove
that the Landlords breached their
maintenance obligations, and their T6 application will be dismissed.
 
 
 
 
Remedy:
46.  The Tenants said that they cleaned up the residential
complex inside and out prior to moving out. However,
the Landlords photos showed that a lot of detritus and garbage was left
outside, and it looked very susceptible to attracting cockroaches and pests.
Therefore, I find that the Landlords have proved, on a balance
of probabilities, their claim
for the pest treatment necessitated by damage caused by the Tenants’ garbage.
 
47.  The parties disputed
the thermostat repair
cost of $35.00
from 2018. The Landlords’
documentary evidence proved, on a balance of probabilities, that the damage to
the thermostat was caused by the Tenants.
 
48.  The Landlords obtained a number of estimates for
repair work that they allege was required after the Tenants left the rental
unit. They had estimates from May and
June, 2019, when they first noticed the damage, and an estimate from October
27, 2019, after the Tenants had vacated the rental unit. I am guided by the later estimate from October,
2019, as the Tenants had already completed some repairs
to light fixtures and switches. The Landlords have not included the light
switches in their final estimate, nor have they included window screens that
were in the first estimate.
 
49.  With regard to all the interior damage, the Landlords’
estimate, dated October 27, 2019, for labour to prime and paint, patch and
repair walls, repair and replace flooring, install a new toilet, remove and
install carpets, replace doors, demolish and replace kitchen cabinets, install
windows, blinds, light
fixtures, bathroom vanity,
repair ceilings, and rent a garbage bin, came to a total of
$10,492.50.
 
50.  Based on my above findings,
I will deduct the labour estimates for carpet removal
and installation, two of the blinds, light fixtures, and garbage bin
rental, as the latter is not




 
damage, but was necessary for
containing the damaged removed items. The
total deduction is $1,170.00. Therefore, the total amount
that will be awarded to the Landlords for the labour to repair damage
is $9,322.50.
 
51.  The Landlords claim
over $13,000.00 for materials to repair the damage. They submitted
into evidence a series of receipts from December 2019, without an accompanying
list of what exactly they bought. The
receipts that, I find, represent what are undoubtedly building supplies, as
well as flooring, add up to $14,394.39, before the estimates for appliances are
added. Therefore, the estimates and
receipts for damages far exceed
$14,447.05 (see below).
 
52.  In the Landlords’ amended application of August 13, 2019, they only claim
damages to a total of $14,447.05. Therefore, they can only be granted a
remedy for damages up to a total of $14,447.05, and it will be so ordered.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants’ T2 and T6 applications are dismissed.
 
Landlord Application:
 
2.    
The tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants
terminated on October 14, 2019,
when the Tenants vacated the rental unit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $17,983.84*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to November 30, 2019,
less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $14,447.05 for wilful or negligent damages
they Nancy Morris
4.     caused to the rental unit.
 
5.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlords
the full amount of $32,620.39 owing on or before
February 25, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated
from February 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
