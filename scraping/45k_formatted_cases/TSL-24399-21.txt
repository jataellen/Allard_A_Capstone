Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-24399-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


305, 320 THE WEST
MALL ETOBICOKE ON M9C1C8


 




Between:


Adriana Tari
  Adriano Tari
North Park Holdings Inc.


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Danieja Dosenovic


Tenant



 
 
 
Adriana Tari, Adriano Tari and
North Park Holdings Inc. (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Danieja
Dosenovic (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 12, 2022. Only
the Landlords attended the hearing.
As of 2:59 p.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from January 1, 2016 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective August 27, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     
The lawful monthly rent is $925.00.
 
4.     
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
 
5.      The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
6.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties
and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant
and find that it
would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 30, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant owes the Landlords $42,495.55*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January 19,
2022. However, the Board is only
authorized to order the Tenant to pay the maximum of its monetary jurisdiction
of $35,000.00. Therefore, the Tenant shall pay to the Landlord the amount of
$35,000.00.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $30.41 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 20, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount
owing* on or before January
30, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 31, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 30, 2022, then starting January
31, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after January 31, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenant
wishes to void this order and continue
the Tenancy, the Tenant
must pay
$43,001.00** on or before January
30, 2022 to the Landlords or to the Board in trust. This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the
unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
31, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
 
 
January 19, 2022                                                                                  Date Issued                                                                       Richard
