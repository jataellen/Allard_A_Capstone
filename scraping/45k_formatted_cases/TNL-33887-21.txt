In the matter
of:


PH202, 18 HILLCREST AVENUE TORONTO ON M2N6T5


 




Between:


Jamileh Asgari


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Nurdan Kadrakunov


Tenant



 
 
 
Jamileh Asgari (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Nurdan Kadrakunov (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that
the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 8, 2021.
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
 The notice of termination is defective because
the rental periods
are incorrect and confusing.
 
2.     The Landlord opted
for an order for arrears
only.
 
3.     The Tenant was in possession of the rental
unit on the date the application was filed.
 
4.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
February 28, 2021 to November 27, 2021.
 
5.     The Tenant paid $15,000.00 after the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $7,500.00, which represents the amount of rent
owing up to November 27, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.




File Number: TNL-33887-21
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before February
11, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 12, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
