Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: SWL-00849-17











 

RP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict RJ (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential
complex has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The
Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the
Landlord for the damage. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date. (L2)
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes. (L2)
 
The Landlord also applied for an order
determining whether the Tenant altered the locking system without the Landlord's
consent. (L8)
 
This application was heard in [CITY] on
June 28, 2018.  The Landlord attended.
As of 1:00 p.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this
hearing by the Board. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
These applications were
first scheduled for hearing on April 27, 2017.  On that day the Landlord
attended.  The Tenant attended the hearing along with the Tenant’s Legal
Representative, TC.  The Tenant’s Legal Representative requested that the
hearing be adjourned until the Tenant’s action in Superior Court File No.
6677/17 had been resolved.  The hearing was adjourned and reconvened by
telephone hearing to determine the status of the matte several times.  
 
When the matter resumed
by telephone hearing on June 12, 2018, the Tenant’s Legal Representative
advised that the Superior Court matter had been settled and that the Tenant
concedes that the Board has jurisdiction.  
 
When the hearing
resumed on June 28, 2018, the Tenant’s Legal Representative requested that he
be removed as solicitor of record because he had been unable to obtain
instructions from his client.  He confirmed that the Tenant was aware of the
hearing date but was not in attendance.  I granted the Tenant’s Legal
Representative’s request and the matter proceeded in the Tenant’s absence.
 
Determinations:
Application to
Terminate a Tenancy and Evict a Tenant (L2)
Notice to Terminate
a Tenancy Early (N5)
 
1.     
The Tenant has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit by:
removing a screen door, and railing from the porch and by putting a gas stove
outside.  
 
2.     
The Landlord will incur costs of $850.00 to repair the damage and replace property that was
damaged and cannot be reasonably repaired.
Application Because the Tenant Changed
the Locks
 
3.     
The Landlord withdrew the
application about changing locks.
Application to Evict a Tenant for Non-payment of Rent and
to Collect the Rent the Tenant Owes (L1)
4.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from February 1, 2015
to December 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective March 16, 2017.
 
5.      The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
 
6.      The monthly rent is $600.00.
 
7.      The Landlord is not holding a last month's rent deposit. 
 
8.      The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed. 
 
9.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
Application to
Terminate a Tenancy and Evict a Tenant (L2)
 
1.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $850.00, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage
and replacing the damaged property.
 
2.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before July 14, 2018.
Application to Evict a Tenant for Non-payment of Rent and
to Collect the Rent the Tenant Owes (L1)
3.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $14,967.64*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to July 3, 2018.
 
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $19.73 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
July 4, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before July 14, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from July 15,
2018 at .00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
7.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before July 14, 2018, then starting July 15, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
8.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 15, 2018.
