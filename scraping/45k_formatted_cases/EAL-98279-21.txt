Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-98279-21



In the
  matter of:


5993 PINEGLADE CRESCENT ORLEANS ON K1W1G7


 




Between:


Janie Bastien Taylor Bastien


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Justin Wolfe Bard Megan Davey


Tenants



 
 
Janie Bastien
and Taylor Bastien
(the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Megan Davey and Justin Wolfe
Bard (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 1, 2022.
 
The Landlord, Taylor Bastien,
the Landlords’ Legal Representative, Katherine Smith, the Tenant Megan Davey,
on behalf of both Tenants,
and the Tenants’ Legal Representative, Jamie Labonte,
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective October 2, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $2,600.00.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     
The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $2,600.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
6.     
The Tenants
indicated at the hearing that they have applied for financial support
to cover the rent arrears to
January 31st. The
Landlords also indicated that they were aware that an agency would be willing
to pay a large bulk balance of the Tenants overdue arrears.
 
7.     
The Tenants also testified
that they are both back to work and that they are now receiving a childcare subsidy and
indicated that they believe they would also be receiving CERB




 
and sickness benefits and requested more time in order to void the order for eviction to February 28, 2022.
 
8.     
The Landlord indicated that it
would be prejudicial to extend any sort of timeline to the Tenants to pay the arrears and that the Landlord feels as though
they are supporting both their own family and the Tenant’s family due to the Tenants
failure to pay any rent.
 
9.     
Based on the oral evidence before
me and the position of the parties,
I do not find it unfair
to postpone the enforcement of the order to February 28, 2021. I do not find a 12 day delay to be
unreasonable under the circumstances.
 
10.  
If the bulk payment
comes through and the Tenants
satisfy the outstanding arrears, then I see value in the added time for both the
Landlords and the Tenants.
 
11.   If the Tenants
do not pay the full amount owing,
then the Landlord
has the ability to file this order with the enforcement
office starting March 1, 2022.
 
12.   I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 28, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b)
of the Act.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenants void the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.
 
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $11,381.72*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 16, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $85.48 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 17,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before
February 28, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after March 1, 2022.




 
8.     
If, on or before February 28,
2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $15,286.00** to the Landlords or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     
The Tenants may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
