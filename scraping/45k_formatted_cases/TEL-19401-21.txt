In the matter
of:


422, 50 TUXEDO
COURT TORONTO ON M1G3S8


 




Between:


Toronto Community Housing Corp


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 


Tenant




 


Azizollah Bagherian


 



 
 
 
Toronto Community Housing Corp (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict Azizollah Bagherian (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 20, 2021. The Landlord's Representative, Dale
Maingot, attended the hearing. The
Tenant attended the hearing with the assistance of Farsi interpreter, M.
Abdolalian.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from October 1,
2019 to December 31, 2021. Because of
the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective November 16,
2019.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $271.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant
has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Tenant, who has
resided in the rental unit for about 5 years, testified that he is employed and
earns between $1,000.00 and $1,500.00 monthly although his job was impacted by the pandemic
at one point. The Tenant
acknowledged that with the help of his daughter, he made a payment plan with the Landlord in February 2021 but did not keep up
with the terms.
 
6.    
The Tenant proposed a
plan to pay $100.00 monthly towards the arrears but given the Tenant’s failure
to pay any rent in the past few months,
I am not satisfied that he can comply
with a conditional order.




 
7.    
The NSF cheque charges
of $60.00 were not substantiated, therefore the claim was denied.
 
8.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
9.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would not be unfair
to postpone the eviction until
February 15, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b)
of the Act. Additional time given to the Tenant to either secure alternative
accommodation or pay the outstanding amount.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before February 15, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $5,564.08*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 7, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also
pay to the Landlord $8.91 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting January 8, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 15, 2022, the
Tenant will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from February 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated on or before February 15, 2022, then starting February 16, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 16, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$5,948.00 if the payment
is made on or before January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$6,219.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 15, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after
February 16, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenant is only




 
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
