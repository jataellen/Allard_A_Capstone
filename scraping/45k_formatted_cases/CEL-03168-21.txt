Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-03168-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


1, 38 MCMURCHY AVENUE
NORTH BRAMPTON ON L6X1Y1


 




Between:


Paul
  Matheson


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Bryan Hubbard Shannon Bartholomew


Tenants



 
 
 
Paul Matheson (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Bryan Hubbard and Shannon Bartholomew (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 24, 2022. The Landlord and the
Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from April 1, 2021 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 19, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,522.50.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,500.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     The Tenants paid $7,812.50 after the application was filed.
 
6.     The Tenants indicated
that they have been living
in the rental unit for about 7 years and they can come to a zero balance by
March 11, 2022.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the




File Number: CEL-03168-21
 
Tenant, and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until March 11, 2022
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b)
of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 11, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $537.97*,
which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 8, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$50.05 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 9, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before March 11, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from March 12, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 11, 2022, then starting March 12, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 12, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)          
$3,296.00 if the payment
is made on or before February 28, 2022, or
ii)         
$4,818.50 if the payment
is made on or before
March 11, 2022**.
If the
Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after March 12, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
