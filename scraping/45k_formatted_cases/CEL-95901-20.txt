In the matter
of:


209, 573
NORTH SERVICE ROAD MISSISSAUGA ON L5A1B6


 




Between:

Service Road Apt


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Syed Gilani


Tenant



 
 
 
549-573 North Service Road Apt (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Syed
Gilani (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 10, 2022. The Landlord's Legal Representative Samuel Korman attended the hearing. The
Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
December 1, 2019 to April 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August
28, 2020.
 
2.     The application is amended to reflect the arrears of rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
3.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
4.    
The lawful monthly rent is $1,051.92.
 
5.     The Landlord is holding a last month’s
rent deposit that exceeds the current monthly
rent, which is not permitted by the Act. The Tenant has been credited
with $109.28, which is the difference between
the amount currently held and the permissible amount.
The credit is reflected as a payment. The rent deposit now equals the
current monthly rent.
 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,051.92 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.     The Tenant paid $15,088.28 after the application was filed.




File Number: CEL-95901-20
 
8.    
The Tenant testified that he has
experienced interruptions within his employment and was working on reduced hours from the start of the Covid-19
pandemic. The Tenant is currently receiving more hours at work and proposed a repayment plan in
which he would contribute an additional $200.00 each month towards the
arrears of rent.
 
9.     The Tenant has resided in the rental
unit for approximately 15 years and has never been
before the Board for a non-payment of rent application. If evicted, the Tenant would require approximately 2 months to
vacate the rental unit.
 
10.  The Landlord’s legal representative argued that the
matter was previously before the Board on April 26, 2021 and adjourned due to
scheduling overflow. The Landlord’s
representative stated that at the last hearing, the Tenant was looking to
propose the same repayment plan, but since
then has not made any additional payments
towards his rent arrears.
 
Relief from eviction:
 
11.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until March 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
12.  The Tenant’s proposed
repayment plan would take approximately 2 years to pay the arrears in full. The Tenant’s monthly
expenses, including the rent almost
exceed the
Tenant’s monthly income. The Tenant provided
no evidence to support that his monthly income is set to increase in the
near future. I am however mindful
that the Tenant has resided in the rental unit for 15 years and as such, find it would not be unfair to allow the
Tenant some additional time to find alternate housing or to pay the arrears in
full.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 31, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $4,051.58*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
16, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $34.58 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 17, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before
March 31, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from April 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.




File Number: CEL-95901-20
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 31, 2022, then starting April 1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 1, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$5,758.88 if the payment
is made on or before February 28, 2022, or
ii)             
$6,810.80 if the payment
is made on or before
March 31, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after
April 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to
the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
