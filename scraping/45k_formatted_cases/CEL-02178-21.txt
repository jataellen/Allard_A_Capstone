In the matter
of:


17 NICHOLSON DRIVE BARRIE ON L4N8L7


 




Between:


Dmytro Khvalov
  Galina Khvalov


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Desiree Ryder Rhonda Green


Tenants



 
 
 
Dmytro Khvalov and Galina Khvalov
(the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Desiree Ryder and Rhonda Green (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for
the purpose of residential occupation.
The Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by way
of video conference on November 4, 2021. The
Landlord Dmytro Khvalov attended
the hearing and was represented by Elina Vasilieva, Paralegal. The Tenant
Desiree Ryder attended the hearing and was self represented.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
The Landlord’s
application is based on an N12 Notice of Termination served to the Tenants on August 14, 2021, with a termination date of October
14, 2021. The N12
indicates that the Landlords intend to move into the rental unit.
 
2.   
The Landlords have filed an affidavit sworn certifying that they in good faith
requires the rental unit for
their own personal use for a minimum of 1 year.
 
3.   
The Landlord
paid the Tenant
compensation equal to one month's
rent. The parties
agree that the June 2021 rent has been waived.




 
Good faith:
 
4.   
The N12 was served pursuant to Section 48(1) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006,
(the Act) which states
in part:
 
48 (1)
A landlord may, by notice, terminate a tenancy if the landlord in good faith
requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation for a period of
at least one year by,
 
(a) the landlord;
 
5.   
In Feeney v.
Noble, 1994 CanLII 10538 (ON SC), the
Court held that the test of good faith is genuine intention to occupy the
premises and not the reasonableness of the Landlord’s proposal. This principle was upheld in Salter v.
Beljinac 2001 CanLII 40231 (ON SCDC), where the Court held that the “good faith” requirement simply means that a sincere
intends to occupy the rental unit. The Landlord may also have additional
motives for selecting a particular rental unit, but this does not affect the
good faith of the Landlord’s notice.”
 
6.   
 In the more
recent case of Fava v. Harrison, [2014] O.J No. 2678 ONSC 3352 (Ont.Div.Ct.)
the Court determined that while the motives of the Landlord are, per
Salter, “largely irrelevant”, the Board can consider the conduct and motives of
the Landlord to draw inferences as to whether
the Landlord desires,
in good faith to occupy the property.”
Landlord’s evidence:
 
 
7.   
The Landlord
Dmytro Khvalov provided oral testimony at the hearing and was the Landlord’s sole witness. The Landlord testified
that he and his wife intend to move into the
rental unit and reside there permanently.
 
8.   
The Landlord
testified that his children have moved out and that his current house is too
big for just him and his wife. The Landlord’s current
home is 2600 sq ft. and the rental unit is
only 1800 sq ft. The Landlord
testified that he intends to sell his current home and move into the rental unit. The Landlord
testified that he and his wife are currently experiencing financial
difficulties in paying a mortgage on the two properties.
 
9.    On cross examination the Landlord
agreed that the rental unit requires extensive repairs and renovations. The Landlord stated that once he has possession of the rental unit, he will spend
approximately $100,000 to conduct renovations . The Landlord intends
to use the funds profited
from the sale of his current home to conduct the renovations.




 
Tenant’s evidence:
 
10.
The Tenant
Desiree Ryder provided oral testimony at the hearing and was the Tenant’s sole witness.
The Tenant disputes
the Landlord’s alleged
intentions and believes
that the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit to renovate and re-rent for higher amount.
 
11.
The Tenant
submitted into evidence
an email from the Landlord
dated August 9, 2021
(TT exhibit #1). In the email, the
Landlord states the following:
 
“For all
the time that you have rented a house from us, we have never raised your
payment”, “I don’t want to involve
official bodies” and “lets renegotiate a monthly billing agreement, we are forced to raise the rent by $1,000.00 a month. This is lower than the current rent of a similar house in
Barrie. You need to conclude a new
contract before the 15th day of
this month”.
 
12.
The Tenant
rejected the Landlord’s demand to raise the monthly rent by $1,000.00 and
stated that when she advised
the Landlord that this rent increase was illegal, the Landlord
proceeded to serve the Tenant with a N12 on August 14, 2021.
 
13.
The Tenant
testified that she is a single mother
with two children. The Tenant testified that she has looked for new rental units but has been
unsuccessful in finding a suitable unit.
 
Analysis:
 
14. Based on the evidence before the Board, I am not satisfied
on a balance of probabilities that the Landlords in good
faith intend to reside in the rental unit.
 
15. The evidence before
the Board is clear that the Landlord
emailed the Tenant
on August 9, 2021 requesting that the Tenant sign a
new lease and agree to increase the monthly rent by $1,000.00. The Tenant refused the increase and the
Landlord then served the Tenant with an N12 notice only 5 days later on August
14, 2021. On a balance of probabilities, I would agree with the Tenant that the timing
of these events
establishes that the Landlords likely served the N12
notice because the Tenant’s did not agree to pay the illegal rent increase of
$1,000.00.
 
16. I also have concerns about
the credibility of the Landlord’s testimony. The Landlord stated that he and his wife are experiencing
financial difficulties, but later admitted on cross examination that he intends
to spend approximately $100,000.00 in renovations on the rental unit, which
requires extensive repairs.
 
17. I would agree with the Tenant’s assertion that the
evidence establishes that Landlords’ likely intention is to take possession of
the rental unit for the sole purpose of re-renting the rental unit at
a higher rent,
not for their
own residential occupation. As such the Landlords’
application shall be dismissed.




 
 
 
18. This Order contains
all the reasons for this matter. No further reasons
will issue.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
 
2.    
Pursuant to section 73.1 of the
Act, the Tenant shall pay back to the Landlord the required compensation paid
pursuant to section 48.1. The
Tenant’s obligation to pay June 2021 rent is reinstated and the Landlord
may proceed with the lawful
remedies to recover this
amount owed if it is not paid by the Tenant by February 15, 2022.
