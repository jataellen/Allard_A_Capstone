Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57361-21
 
 



In the matter of:


307, 733 DEVERON CRESCENT LONDON ON N5Z4X7


 




Between:


Gold Leaf
Properties Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Darlene Calhoun


Tenant



 
 
 
Gold Leaf Properties Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Darlene Calhoun (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has been persistently late in
paying the Tenant's rent.
 
This application
was heard via video conference on February 17, 2022. Only the Landlord’s legal representative, Cindy Read, attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The sign-in process for the
hearing began at 8:30am and the hearing was scheduled to begin at 9:00am. I
wanted until 9:52am and I canvased the virtual hearing room, the virtual
reception area, the virtual waiting room and all of the breakout rooms to
confirm whether the Tenant attended the hearing. The Tenant’s name did not
appear in any of these areas, I was satisfied that the Tenant
failed to attend
the hearing and I proceeded
to hear the Landlord’s application as an uncontested matter.
 
2.    
The Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was
due. According to the Landlord’s application, the Tenant
has paid their rent late 9 out of 11 times since April 2021. For this reason,
the Landlord’s application must be granted.
 
3.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant
must move out of the rental
unit on or before March 31, 2022.




File Number: SWL-57361-21
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before March 7, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 8, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 31, 2022,
then starting April
1, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
5.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after April 1, 2022.

In accordance with section 81

Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
