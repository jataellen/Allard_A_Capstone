Beuna B Livingstone


Tenant



 
 
 
Myriad Property
Management (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Beuna B Livingstone (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on July 5, 2021. The Landlord, represented by Bryan Rubin, and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.    
The Tenant
has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from February 1, 2021 to July 31, 2021. Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination
effective April 22, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant
is in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is
$1,452.05.
 
4.    
The arrears
of rent owing
for the period
ending July 31, 2021 as of the date of hearing
were $8705.06.
 
5.    
The Landlord
incurred costs of $186.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,435.43 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.




File Number: TNL-32178-21
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from April
1, 2020 to April 22, 2021.
 
 
8.    
At the hearing, the
Tenant consented to an eleven-day eviction order. The Tenant has sought assistance from The Rent Bank to cover the
rent arrears. Having considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including whether the Landlord has
attempted to negotiate a repayment plan with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
 
It is
ordered that:
 
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 16, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $14,827.09 (less any payments made to the Landlord after July 5,
2021) *, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
5, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $47.74
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 6, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
16, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January
17, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 17, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 16, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $17,603.36 (less any payments
made to the Landlord after July 5, 2021) ** to the Landlord or to the Board in
trust, this order for eviction will be void.
This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could
remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.




File Number: TNL-32178-21
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
17, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
