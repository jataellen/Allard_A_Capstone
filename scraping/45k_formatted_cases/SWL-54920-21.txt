In the matter
of:


2, 74 EMERY
STREET W LONDON ON N6J1R8


 




Between:


869797 Ontario Ltd


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kamal Maadarany


Tenant



 
 
 
869797 Ontario Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Kamal Maadarany (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent.
 
This application was heard via video conference on January 10, 2022.
Only the Landlord’s Agent, Laura Anthony attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s L2/N8 application is made pursuant
to an N8 notice served
on the Tenant on September
14, 2021 with a termination date of November 30, 2021. The lease was month-to-month at the time of service and rent was
due on the 1st of every month. The tenancy commenced October 1, 2015.
 
2.    
Based on the oral testimony of the Landlord’s Agent and the contents
of the N8 notice, I find that the Tenant has persistently
failed to pay the rent on the date
it was due. As at the date of
the hearing, the Tenant has been
late in paying rent 17 months
in a row that first became due starting June 11,
2020.
 
3.     I accept the uncontested testimony and evidence of the
Landlord’s Agent and am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the Tenant
has persistently failed
to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
Section 83 considerations:
 
4.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to




File Number: SWL-54920-21
 
grant relief from eviction
subject to the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection
83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
5.     The Tenant has been residing in the rental unit since
2015 and from the uncontested evidence at the hearing, was paying rent on time
until June 11, 2020 and since then has been late. I note this time period was during the COVID pandemic and
perhaps the Tenant is having
difficulty meeting their financial obligations. I also heard no evidence
as to the impact the late payments has had on the Landlord’s Agent.
 
6.     As termination is a remedy of last resort, I find that
the Tenant should be given an opportunity with a pay-on-time order
and that it is appropriate in these circumstances.
 
7.     The Landlord has incurred the cost of $186.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
the full rent owing on or before
the first day of each month, commencing March 1, 2022 and
for 12 months thereafter up to and including March 1, 2023.
 
2.     If the Tenant
fail to comply with the conditions set out in paragraph 1 above, then, within
30 days of the breach, the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order terminating the
tenancy and evicting the Tenant.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing this
application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing on or before March 1, 2022, they will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from March 2,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
