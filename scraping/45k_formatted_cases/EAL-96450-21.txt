Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number: EAL-96450-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
APT.#1, 307 MONTFORT RUE VANIER ON K1L5N7


 




Between:


Enock Vainqueur


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Colin Sybrite Smith


Tenant



 
 
 
Enock Vainqueur (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Colin Sybrite Smith (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 6,
2021.
 
Only the Landlord attended the
hearing. As of 1:57 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing,
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
March 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective May 21,
2021.
 
2.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. Based on the uncontested evidence
provided by the Landlord at the hearing, I find that the Tenant failed to pay
his rent in full. I have no reason to deny the eviction order requested by the
Landlord.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before
March 5, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$14,156.14*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 22, 2022.




File Number: EAL-96450-21
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$39.45 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 23, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before March 5, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 6, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 5, 2022, then starting
March 6, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 6, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$14,601.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022,
or
ii)             
$15,801.00 if the payment
is made on or before
March 5, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after March
6, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
