Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-11895-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


B, 425 ELDORADO PRIVATE OTTAWA ON K2K0N9


 




Between:


Fusun Horsun
  Yucel Horsun


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Christopher Larussa
  Lindsay Rees


Tenants



 
 
 
Fusun Horsun and Yucel Horsun
(the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Christopher Larussa and Lindsay Rees (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe. The Landlord also applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict the 'Tenants' because they have been
persistently late in paying their rent.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653#
on January 12, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord, and the Landlords’ Representative, Bita DiLisi
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
2.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective August 24, 2021.
 
3.    
The Landlords collected
a rent deposit of $1,800.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
4.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from December
6, 2020 to August 24, 2021.
 
5.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair to
grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 1, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $8,495.99*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 21, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlords
$59.18 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 22, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before February
1, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 2, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 1, 2022, then starting February
2, 2022, the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 2, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenants
wish to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlords or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$11,001.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$12,801.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 1, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not make full
payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline,
then the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 2, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenants are only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlords.
 
L2 Application:
 
10.  If the Tenants pays the Landlord the full amount owing
in compliance with paragraph 8 hereof, the Tenants
may remain in the unit, but only if
they pay the Landlord the monthly
rent on time and in full on the first business day of the month for a twelve
month period starting March 2022 to February 2023.




 
11.  If the Tenants fail to make any of the rental payments
for this period on time and in compliance with paragraph 10, the Landlord may, without notice
to the Tenants, apply to the Board pursuant to section 78 of the
Act for an order, terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants.
