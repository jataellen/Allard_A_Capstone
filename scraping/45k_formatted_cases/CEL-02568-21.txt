Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-02568-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


UPPER, MAIN EN, 39 ROYAL
PALM DRIVE BRAMPTON ON
  L6Z1P1


 




Between:


Theresa Rampat Jared Bowan Jaduram


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Jasiah Mendez
  Juliza Virgilien
Tuwayne Anthony Raekwon Virgilien Veronique Mendez Virgilien


Tenants



 
 
 
Theresa Rampat and Jared Bowan
Jaduram (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Jasiah
Mendez, Tuwayne Anthony
Raekwon Virgilien, Juliza
Virgilien and Veronique
Mendez Virgilien (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe (L1 application).
 
The Landlords also applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
the Tenants because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone
they permitted in the residential complex have
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlords or another tenant; and
because they have been persistently late in paying their rent. The Landlords
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after
the termination date (L2 application).
 
This combined application was heard by video/teleconference on January 6, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord, Jared Bowan Jaduram,
and the Landlords’ legal representative, Shalini Puri, attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 application:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from January 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords
served a Notice of Termination effective July 23, 2021.
 
2.    
The monthly rent is $2,140.00.

3.    
The Tenants paid $7,150.00
after the application was filed.
 
4.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $2,100.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from September 1, 2019 to July 23, 2021.
 
6.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
the Act.
 
L2 application:
 
7.     The Tenants failed
to pay the Landlords $534.00
for utilities and $200.00 for parking.
 
8.    
The Landlords served the Tenants a Notice of Termination, Form N5. The Tenants did not void the notice.
 
9.     This conduct has substantially interfered with the lawful right,
privilege or interest
of the Landlords.
 
10.  At the time of the hearing the Tenants owed the Landlords $2,647.00 for utilities
and parking.
 
11.  The Tenants have also persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
12.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
L1 application:

the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 4, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $7,526.56*, which represents the amount of rent

interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.

The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $70.36 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 25, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.

also pay to the Landlords $201.00 for the cost of filing the application.




 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before February

2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 4, 2022, then starting February
5, 2022, the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.

Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 5, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenants
wish to void this order,
the Tenants must pay to the Landlords or to the Board in trust:

$10,221.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or

$12,361.00 if the payment
is made on or before February 4, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not make full
payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline,
then the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 5, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlords. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
 
L2 application:
