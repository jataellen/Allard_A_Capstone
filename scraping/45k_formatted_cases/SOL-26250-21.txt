Order under
Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number:
SOL-26250-21




 
In the matter
  of:


 
307, 5521
DRUMMOND AVENUE NIAGARA ON
  L2G7G8


 




Between:


Drummond Place


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Harpal Dosanjh


Tenant



 
 
 
On November 4, 2021, Drummond
Place (the 'Landlord') applied in this L4 application for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Harpal Dosanjh (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have
the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a
condition specified in the consent
order issued by the Board
on October 26, 2021 with respect to L1 application SOL- 24177-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The consent order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I find that the Tenant has not met
the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenant failed to pay $800.00 towards
arrears on or before November
1, 2021. The Tenant also failed to pay the lawful
monthly rent on or before November 1, 2021. These were breaches of paragraphs 2(a) and 2(b) from the consent order.
This L4 application was filed
within 30 days of the breaches.
 
3.       
The previous L1 application included a request
for an order for the payment
of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the
Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in
addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the
payment of arrears of rent and compensation in this L4 application.
 
4.       
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$3,634.34 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in previous
consent Order SOL-24177-21. The amount that is
still owing from that order is $3,634.34 and that amount is included in this
order. As a result, the previous order SOL-24177-21 is cancelled.




 
5.       
Since the date of the order,
the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from November 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.
 
6.       
On July 1, 2018 the
Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,125.11 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.       
Interest on the rent deposit was
paid out until June 30, 2021. There is
no further interest owing since 2021 did not allow any guideline rent increase (and consequently no interest
on deposit) due to COVID19.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The previous consent order SOL-24177-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January
15, 2022 (standard 11 days from the issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
If the Tenant made any payments
to the Landlord after this L4 application was filed, those amounts shall be deducted from the
calculations below.
 
4.       
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $4,997.92*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 4,
2022 (the issuance date of this order) and the costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord
owes on the rent deposit.
 
5.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$38.04 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 5, 2022 to
the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
6.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
15, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 16, 2022 at .00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 16, 2022.

The tenant has until January 14, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 14, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on July 16, 2022 if the order has not been
filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that
has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
