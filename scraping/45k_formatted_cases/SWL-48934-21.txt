Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-48934-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


107, 167 MORGAN AVE KITCHENER ON N2A2M4


 




Between:


Centurion Property Associates Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Ifra Yusnf Mohamed Mahdi Mohamed Hassan


Tenants



 
 
Centurion Property Associates Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Mahdi Mohamed Hassan and Ifra Yusnf Mohamed (the 'Tenants') because:
a)  the Tenants, another occupant of the rental unit or
someone they permitted in the residential complex have substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of
the Landlord or another tenant
b)  the Tenants, another occupant of the rental unit or
someone they permitted in the residential complex have wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises.
 
The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after the
termination date and also applied
for an order requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlord
for the damage,
 
This application was heard by way of video
conference on July 5, 2021 and February
15, 2022 at 9:00 am. The Landlord’s Legal
Representative, Robert Rose attended the hearing as well as a witness for the
Landlord, Zinah Radocaj. As of 10:10
am the Tenant’s were not present or represented at the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    The Landlord filed the L2 application on January 5,
2021.
 
2.   
The Tenants vacated the rental unit on February
28, 2021 and therefore the only remedy the Landlord is seeking is
compensation for damages.
 
3.    On May 17, 2021, the Board mailed
a copy of the Notice
of Hearing to both Tenants
at the rental unit for the hearing date of July 5, 2021, and also emailed
a copy to the email address supplied by the Landlord.
 
4.   
The July 5, 2021, hearing was
adjourned by the presiding member as she was not satisfied that the Tenants
had received a copy of the Notice of Hearing
by way of email.




File Number: SWL-48934-21
 
The Landlord provided an email
address on file for the Tenants of hafsasugue99@gmail.com. A new Notice of Hearing was to be sent to the Tenants
for the next scheduled
hearing date to be determined by the Board.
 
5.    The Board emailed a new Notice of Hearing to the
Tenants on January 19, 2022 for the hearing date scheduled
for February 15, 2022. However,
it was returned undeliverable to the email address noted in Paragraph 2.
 
6.    With respect to Notice of Hearing sent by mail on May
17, 2021, at the hearing February 15, 2022 I indicated that the envelope
was not returned
to sender. However,
upon further review of the
file it was determined that envelope was returned to the Board as undeliverable
on June 9, 2021.
 
7.    On February 8, 2022, the Landlord emailed the Tenants
a copy of an amended L2 application as well as the Landlord’s disclosure package to the Tenant’s email
address as noted in Paragraph
2, which was returned undeliverable to the Landlord.
 
8.    The Landlord does not have a forwarding address for the Tenants.
 
9.    I am not satisfied that the Tenants received the
Notice of Hearing by the Board for the original hearing date of July 5, 2021 by either mail or email as both notices were returned
to the Board as undeliverable. Further,
I am not satisfied that the Tenants received the Notice of Hearing for the
February 15, 2022 hearing or the Landlord’s amended L2 application as the
emails were returned as undeliverable.
 
10. Given the lack of notice
it would be unfair to proceed with the hearing.
 
11. At the hearing
the Landlord was given the option to seek an adjournment or withdraw their application. The adjournment would allow the Landlord additional time to
locate the Tenants and provide an updated address of service to the Board to
schedule a new hearing and issue a new Notice of Hearing to the Tenants.
 
12. The Landlord’s Legal Representative requested
the consent of the Board to withdraw
their application on a without prejudice basis. I consented to the
request.
.
It is ordered that:
 
1.

This matter has been withdrawn
on a without prejudice basis.
The Board’s file is closed.
