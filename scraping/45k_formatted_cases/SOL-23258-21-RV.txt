Review Order
 
Luzviminda Muella (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Edmund Ramesh Williams (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was resolved by order SOL-23258-21 issued on November
19, 2021. On November 22,
2021, the Tenant requested a review of the order.
The request was heard by videoconference on February 7, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord’s legal
representative G. Gosling attended the hearing. As of 2:47pm, the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this
hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
Review
 
1.     The Landlord’s request
for a review is based on the ground of being not reasonably able to participate in the proceedings.
 
2.     The hearing that gave rise to the order under
review took place on October
26, 2021. The Landlord did not attend or send a
representative.
 
3.     At the review hearing, the Landlord’s representative testified that neither
the Landlord nor the Landlord’s representative received
notice of the hearing. They discovered that a hearing had been held when they
received the order.




 
4.    
Based on the Landlord’s
uncontested evidence, at the hearing I found, on a balance of probabilities, that the Landlord
was not reasonably able to participate in the proceedings. I granted the review request
and the Landlord’s L1 application was heard de novo.
 
L1 application
 
5.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
May 12, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 19,
2021.
 
6.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
7.    
The monthly rent is
$650.00.
 
8.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $650.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
9.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from March 13, 2021 to July 19, 2021.
 
10.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SOL-23258-21 issued
on November 17, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the
following:
 
2.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before February 26,
2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,329.80*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
15, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $21.37 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 16, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 26, 2022, then starting
February 27, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.




 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 27, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 26, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $6,686.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 27, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period
of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
