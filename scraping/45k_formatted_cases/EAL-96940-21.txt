Order under
Section 79
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006


 




 


 
File Number: EAL-96940-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
301, 1490 CLEMENTINE BOULEVARD OTTAWA ON K1H8E9


 




Between:


Ottawa Salus


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Dale Seaward


Tenant



 
 
 
Ottawa Salus
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order determining that Dale Seaward (the 'Tenant')
has abandoned the rental unit.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 17, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal
Representative, Michael Thiele,
attended the hearing. As of 11:37 a.m., the Tenant was not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     Based on the uncontested evidence, I find that the Tenant
has abandoned the rental unit.
 
2.     The Tenant is in arrears
of rent.
 
3.    
The Tenant has not been
seen at the rental unit since July 21, 2021. The Landlord conducted an inspection
of the rental unit and found mostly trash and broken furniture
inside. I also note that the Tenant was not present at the hearing
despite receiving the notice of hearing by the Board.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of July 21, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.




File Number: EAL-96940-21
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before January
22, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 23, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
