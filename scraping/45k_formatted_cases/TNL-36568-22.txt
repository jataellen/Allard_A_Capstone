Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-36568-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


BASEMENT RM #1, 17 TEDDER STREET NORTH YORK ON M6M4W9


 




Between:


Fernanda Asanza


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Mohamad Kamara


Tenant



 
 
 
On January 14, 2022, Fernanda Asanza (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Mohamad Kamara (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant entered into an agreement to terminate the
tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord’s L3 application is brought under section 77 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”).
 
2.     Subsection 77(1) provides
the following two grounds on which a Landlord may apply
under section 77 of the Act:
 
77 (1) A landlord
may, without notice to the tenant, apply to the Board for an order terminating a tenancy and evicting
the tenant if,
 
(a)    
the landlord and tenant have entered
into an agreement to terminate
the tenancy; or
 
(b)    
the tenant has given the landlord
notice of termination of the tenancy.
 
3.    
Annexed to the Landlord’s application is a purported eviction
notice, given under section
48 of the Act, dated December 6, 2021, purporting to terminate the tenancy
effective noon on December 31, 2021. The
eviction notice is not on the prescribed N12 form to terminate a tenancy under
section 48 of the Act, and is also neither a notice of termination given by the
Tenant, nor an agreement to terminate the tenancy. It would appear that the notice also fails to identify the unit
number of the rental unit. No other
notice or agreement forms part of the Landlord’s application.
 
4.     The Landlord’s application does not disclose a ground
to bring an application that complies with subsection 77(1) of the Act, as the purported notice of termination that




File Number: TNL-36568-22
 
forms the basis of the application is a notice
given by the Landlord, not a notice
given by the Tenant. The application must therefore be dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
