Minto
Apartment Limited Partnership (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate

in the order issued by the Board on April 21, 2021 with
respect to application TNL-24120-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenants have not met the following
condition specified in the order:
The Tenants failed to pay the lawful monthly rent in full on or before
November 1, 2021.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.

2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 23, 2022.
 
3.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 23, 2022, then starting January
24, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.

Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give

The tenant has until January
22, 2022 to file a motion with the
Board to set aside the order under s. 78(9)
of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January
22, 2022 the order will be
stayed, and the Board will schedule a hearing.
 
 
6.       
In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on July 24,
2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
