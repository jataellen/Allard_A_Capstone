1923019 Ontario Inc. (the

Grenier (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 24, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Allison
MacSporran, attended the hearing. As of 2:56 p.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to January

Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 27, 2021

the rental unit on November
30, 2021. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.

rent was $1,700.00.
 
4.    
The Tenants have made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected

and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from April
22, 2020 to September 27, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of November
30, 2021, the date the Tenants returned vacant possession of the rental
unit to the Landlord.
