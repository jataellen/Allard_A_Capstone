Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26871-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


1, 95 LEEMING STREET HAMILTON ON L8L5T5


 




Between:


Emmanuel Anastasakis


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Joshua Michie


Tenant



 
 
 
Emmanuel Anastasakis (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Joshua
Michie (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the
Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified
in the mediated settlement issued by the Board on January 12, 2022 with respect
to application LTB-L-000082-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The mediated settlement provided that the Landlord
could apply to the Board under section 78 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act') without
notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet
certain condition(s) specified in the settlement.
 
2.     I
find that the Tenant has not met the following condition specified in the
settlement: The Tenant
did not pay $2005.00 arrears
on or before January 20, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting mediated settlement required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request
an order for the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The amount that is still owing, according to the terms
of the mediated settlement, for arrears of rent, and the costs related
to the application fee for the previous
application is
$4,101.00.
 
5.     Since the date of the mediated settlement, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that
became owing for the period from February 1, 2022 to February 28, 2022.
 
6.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,245.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.




File Number: SOL-26871-22
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from December 3, 2021
to February 8, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 19, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$3,199.23*. This amount represents the rent owing up to February 8, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$42.90 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 9, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
19, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 20, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 19, 2022, then starting
February 20, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 20, 2022.

The tenant has until February 18, 2022
to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by February 18, 2022 the order will be stayed and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81
of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on August 20, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
