Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-77387-18
 











 




In the matter of:


 


 




 


 


 




Between:


G D
 


Landlord




 


 


 




 


and


 




 


 


 




 


S A
Z M
 


Tenants




 


 


 



 
 
G D (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Z M (ZM) and Saber Ashram (SA) (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Mississauga on July 25,
2018.
 
The Landlord’s Agent, J D (JD),
the Landlord’s Legal Representative, S W, and the Tenants attended the hearing. 
The Tenants brought an Arabic interpreter with them, however little
interpretation was needed as SA spoke and understood English.
 
At the hearing the Tenants raised
the following issues pursuant to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'): laundry facilities, parking and smoking from other
tenants.
 
The following witness testified at
the hearing:
S S (SS) (friend of the Tenants)
on behalf of the Tenants
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants disputed the
rent arrears claimed by the Landlord in this application.   SA stated that on
June 6, 2018 he paid JD $3,200.00 in cash when he attended the rental unit. 
This amount has not been credited to the Tenants.  SA believes that JD has
applied his rent payments to outstanding utility bills that SA does not want to
pay.  
2.     
This tenancy commenced in
December 2017.  The rent arrears in the application stem from April 2018
onward.  JD provided copies of three cheques provided by the Tenants which were
returned NSF or were not able to be deposited as advised by his financial
institution.  The amount of $1,282.00 claimed as outstanding for April 2018
matched the amount on the Tenants’ cheque dated April 10, 2018 that was
returned NSF. 
3.     
SA disputed that his cheque
payments were returned. However, he did not provide his bank statement to
demonstrate the payments were negotiated.  As well, he stated he was not given a
receipt for the cash payment in June 2018 and did not provide any bank records
to demonstrate the cash being withdrawn. 
4.     
The evidence before me was
insufficient to find that the Tenants paid the arrears claimed in this
application to the Landlord.  Without receipts, cancelled cheques, or bank
statements, the Tenants’ alleged payments cannot be verified.  I find it
unlikely that a large sum payment of cash like in this instance could not be
supported by some form of documentation.  
5.     
The Tenants’ witness, SS,
only confirmed in his testimony that on June 6, 2018 the parties were
discussing moneys owed and that the Landlord was not going to provide a receipt
until payment is received.  SS stated twice that he did not see SA give cash to
the JD on this date.   
6.     
As well, the text messages
between the parties submitted into evidence show JD requesting payment of the
arrears after June 6, 2018.  The N4 notice was also served after June 6, 2018. 
I find it highly unlikely that the Landlord would send a text, then serve a
notice of termination, then pay to make an application for an order for
termination, then hire a legal representative, and attend a hearing after
payment was received.  
7.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent they were required to pay for the period from April 1, 2018 to
July 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective June 30, 2018.
8.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,600.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
9.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from December 20, 2017 to June 30, 2018.
10.  
There was no dispute that
recently JD removed the laundry facilities used by the Tenants from the garage
to the basement.  The Tenants allege that they don’t have access to the
basement.  In any event, JD confirmed that the facilities are still in the process
of being installed and are not yet operational.  
11.  
Based on the uncontested
evidence before me, I am satisfied that the Landlord has temporarily
discontinued the use of laundry facilities.  The laundry facilities were
removed from the garage to allow the Tenants use of the garage for their
vehicle.  JD confirmed that the laundry facilities will be operational soon and
that the Tenants will have access to them.  Consequently, I am satisfied that
this temporary discontinuance is reasonable and therefore, no reduction in rent
is warranted.
12.  
SA stated that the basement
and middle tenants smoke marijuana in the residential complex.  ZM has had to
close or cover the vents within their unit.  SA stated that he has sent
hundreds of messages to the JD regarding this issue.  However, SA submitted
only one text from ZM to JD regarding this matter.  The text message submitted
does not provide the date it was sent.
13.  
The evidence before me was
insufficient to find that the Landlord substantially interfered with the Tenants’
reasonable enjoyment of the premises by failing to address the Tenants’
complaints regarding smoking in the residential complex.  The text message
submitted by the Tenants complained of loud music and them being unable to
sleep at night.  There is no mention of marijuana or tobacco smoking in the
complex. 
14.  
In any event, the basement
tenants moved out at the beginning of July 2018.  The Tenants submitted that
the new tenants have two vehicles and were promised by the Landlord two spots. 
The Tenants also have two vehicles.  The Tenants park one vehicle in the garage
and one in the driveway, however the other tenants’ vehicles are being parked
in the driveway resulting in the Tenants’ vehicles being blocked.  
15.  
There was no dispute that
there are four parking spots at the residential complex.  However, in order to
park four vehicles, 1 in garage, 2 side-by-side in driveway, and 1 long way in
driveway, it results in vehicles being blocked.  
16.  
Based on the evidence before
me and given that the new tenants just moved into the complex on July 10, 2018,
that this is the first time that the Landlord is hearing about this issue.  
Therefore, I am not satisfied that the Landlord substantially interfered with
the Tenants’ reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex.  However, the
Landlord is now on notice that there are issues that need to be addressed
regarding the parking before this inconvenience reaches the level of
substantial.   
17.  
The Tenants plan to vacate
the rental unit and requested until the end of September 2018.  They disputed
that they owe any rent arrears and therefore did not offer any payment terms.
18.  
The Landlord does not oppose
an extension to August 31, 2018.
19.  
Having considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, I find
that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until August 31, 2018
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before August
31, 2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $4,444.77*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to July 30, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $52.60 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting July 31, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before August 31, 2018, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
September 1, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before August 31, 2018, then starting September 1, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after September 1, 2018.
8.     
If the Tenants wish to void
this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust:
i)        $6,257.00 if the payment is made on or before July 31, 2018, or
ii)       $7,857.00 if the payment is made on or before August 31, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection
74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under
that subsection on or after September 1, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this
motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
