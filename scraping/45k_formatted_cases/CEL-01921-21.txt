Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006

In the
  matter of:


3172 WORKMAN DRIVE MISSISSAUGA ON L5M6K8


 




Between:


Kamaluddin Mohammad


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Amged Khodair
  Nashwa Ali


Tenants



 
 
 
Kamaluddin Mohammad (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Amged Khodair
and Nashwa Ali (the
'Tenants') because the Landlord
requires possession of the
rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard on February
24, 2022. The Landlord, represented by Moezzam Alvi, and the Tenant Amged Khodair,
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant questions the Landlord’s good faith in
serving the notice for landlord’s own use. The Tenant
points to the fact the Landlord had talked about selling the property, that the Landlord owns a house next this
property, and dispute of the payment of $180.00. I find these submissions do not demonstrate bad faith.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s daughter, Neda
Mohammad, testified that she is the person who requires occupancy of the rental
unit. Neda Mohammad grew up in this
house and was married on October 23, 2021. The couple are now living
with the Landlord
and his family,
and are waiting for this home
as their matrimonial home.
 
3.     The notice to terminate the tenancy was served on July 22, 2021 with a termination date of October 8, 2021, which is the end of the term as shown
on the tenancy agreement.
 
4.     It only seems
reasonable, considering the fact that the termination date on the notice was shortly before the Landlord’s daughter
got married, that the purpose of the notice was for the Landlord’s daughter and
husband to move into the home. The
couple continue to intend to require the home as they want more privacy privacy
than living with their parents.




 
5.    
The Landlord testified that
between the time he spoke about selling the home and the time he served the notice, his daughter decided
to get married and he changed his mind
 
6.     I find the Landlord in good faith
requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
7.     The Landlord paid the Tenant
compensation equal to one month's
rent on July 22, 2021.
 
8.     In determining the date the tenancy should terminate,
I have considered the fact the notice was served
on the Tenants on July 22, 2021
which is over seven months ago and
the fact the Tenants will require time to find alternative accommodations. I
have also considered the fact the Landlord has now waited this long to regain
possession of the home. Having
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair
to postpone the eviction until April 30, 2022 pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated, as of April 30, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the
rental unit on or before April 30, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $10,690.68, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from October 9, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Any amounts the Tenants
have paid to the Landlord during this period shall be a credit to the Tenants
from this amount.
 
3.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$74.76 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from March 1, 2022 to the
date they move out of the unit.
 
4.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before March 11, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 12,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before April 30, 2022, then starting May 1, 2022,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after May 1, 2022.
