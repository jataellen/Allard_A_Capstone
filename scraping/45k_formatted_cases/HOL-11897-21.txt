Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-11897-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


3402, 16 BONNYCASTLE STREET TORONTO ON M5A0C9


 




Between:


Maninder Sandhu
  Rupinder Sandhu


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Haoming Li Ningyu Zhang


Tenants



 
 
 
Maninder Sandhu and Rupinder Sandhu (the 'Landlords') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Ningyu Zhang and Haoming Li
(the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Amanda Richards attended the hearing. As of 9:35 a.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Preliminary Issue:
 
The amount outstanding for the period ending December 31, 2021
($48,286.00, inclusive of the cost of filing the application) exceeds the
$35,000.00 monetary jurisdiction of the Board. The Landlord was informed, and agreed that by proceeding with this application, all rights the Landlord
may have in excess of the Board’s
monetary jurisdiction are extinguished on issuance of this order.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from June 1, 2020 to December 31,
2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective September 1, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     
The lawful
monthly rent is $2,600.00.
 
4.     
The Tenants
have made no payments since the application was filed.




 
5.     
The Landlord’s attempts at negotiating a repayment agreement were unsuccessful.
 
6.     
The Landlord
is not holding a last month's rent deposit.
 
7.     
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the
Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant and find
that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The
amount outstanding is substantial, and the Tenants have not paid any rent since
the application was filed.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlords and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental
unit on or before January 22, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants owes to the
Landlords $49,068.84*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
11, 2022. However,
the Board is only authorized to order the Tenants to pay
the maximum of its monetary jurisdiction of $35,000.00. Therefore, the Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord the amount of $35,000.00.
 
3.    
The Tenants would also
normally be ordered to pay to the Landlord $85.48 per day for compensation for
the use of the unit starting January 12, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit. Having exceeded the Board’s monetary
jurisdiction of $35,000.00 this amount of daily
compensation will therefore not be awarded.
 
4.    
The Tenants
would have normally
been ordered to pay the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application. Having
exceeded the Board’s
monetary jurisdiction of
$35,000.00 the cost of filing the application will therefore not be awarded.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before January
22, 2022, the Tenants will start
to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 23, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 22, 2022, then starting January
23, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this
order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant
possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after January 23, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust
the amount of $35,000.00 which is the maximum limit of the Board’s monetary
jurisdiction. This payment must be
made by January 22, 2022. If, on or before
January 22, 2022, the Tenants
pay the amount of $35,000.00** to the Landlords or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated; and the Tenants could remain
in the unit. If this




 
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after January
23, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
