In the
  matter of:


UPPER LEVEL, 58 HINCHLEY WOOD
GROVE BRAMPTON ON L6V3M3


 




Between:


Amandeep Kaur Khakh Avtar Singh Khakh


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Courtney      A Cater
  Jennifer                  A Parker


Tenants



 
 
 
Amandeep Kaur Khakh and Avtar Singh Khakh
(the 'Landlords') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict Courtney          A Cater and
Jennifer A Parker (the 'Tenants')
because the Landlord has entered
into an agreement of purchase and sale of the rental
unit and the purchaser
requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation. The Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard on February
24, 2022. The Landlord, represented by Ravinder Bassi, and the Tenant, represented by
Charmaine Spiten, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant’s
representative argues that the notice is invalid because the Tenant pays rent on the 2nd day of the month
and the termination date on the notice is September 30, 2021.
 
2.    
The tenancy
agreement was submitted
as evidence and shows that the tenancy commenced on the 1st day of the November 2017.
 
3.     I find the termination date on the notice is the end of the term
and therefore complies with the
Residential Tenancies Act.
 
4.     The Tenant’s representative also argues that there are
changes to the Purchase and Sale Agreement including
a condition of vacant possession. I find the changes do not
affect the fact that the purchaser intends to own the property and wants to
ensure he receives vacant possession so he can occupy the home.




 
5.    
The Tenant’s daughter testified that she called
the real estate
agent when the for sale house sign went up and the agent did not call her back. The Tenant
believes that this demonstrates that the Landlord is
not actually selling the house.
 
6.     The facts show the house went on the market in early
July 2021, the Tenant’s daughter called shortly after and the Purchase and Sale
agreement was signed in July. The
fact the Tenant’s daughter
enquired about the sale of the house
and the agent
did not call her
back does not lead me to conclude the Landlord is not selling the house.
 
7.     Finally, the Tenant’s
representative believes the money paid to the agent in trust is not as much as she believes it should be. Again, I cannot conclude that the Landlord
is not selling the home based on this submission.
 
8.    
Rupal Sandeep Singh signed an
agreement with the Landlords to purchase the residential complex and he in good faith requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
9.     The Landlords have filed an affidavit sworn by the
person who personally requires the rental unit certifying that the person in good faith requires
the rental unit for his or her own
personal use.
 
10.  The Landlord paid the Tenant compensation equal to one month's rent on September 28, 2022.
 
11.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until April 30, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act to
provide the Tenant additional time to relocate.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated, as of April 30, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the
rental unit on or before April 30, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $7,942.60,
which represents compensation for the use of the unit from October 1, 2021 to
February 28, 2022. The Landlord shall credit
the Tenant any amounts that the Tenant has paid during this period.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $52.60
per day for compensation for the use of the unit from March 1, 2022 to the
date they move out of the unit.
 
4.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing on or before March 11, 2022, they will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from March 12,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated on or before April 30, 2022, then starting May 1, 2022, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.




 
 
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after May 1, 2022.
