Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57107-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1,
  1351 KING STREET E CAMBRIDGE ON N3H3R2


 




Between:


Manuel Goncalves Belta Goncalves


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Stephen Mcdougall


Tenant



 
 
 
Manuel
Goncalves Belta Goncalves (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Stephen
Mcdougall (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant,
another occupant of the rental
unit or a person the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
seriously impaired the safety of any person.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on January 17, 2022. Only the Landlord’s agent,
S. Goncalves
(SG), the Landlord’s legal representative, P. Schroeder, and witness, E.
Robinson (ER), attended the hearing. As of 11:27
a.m., the Tenant
was not present or represented although properly served with notice of this hearing by the
Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict the Tenant because he, another occupant of the rental unit or
a person the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has seriously impaired
the safety of any person. The N7 Notice of Termination was served on the Tenant
on November 19, 2021.
 
2.     The N7 Notice alleges that on August 25, August 30 and September 9, 2021, the Landlord
attended the Tenant’s unit for an inspection. On these dates,
the Tenant was found to have
an excessive number of combustible items in the unit and items block egresses
and walkways. After a Fire Inspector’s inspection of the unit on October 13, 2021, on November
17, 2021, the Tenant was ordered to comply with an Order to remove all
excessive combustibles by December 1, 2021.
 
3.    
SG, the Landlord’s property
manager, submitted into evidence various
photographs taken of the unit,
showing items blocking the entry to the unit, two feet of debris on the floor
of the entire unit, and items piled behind the doors.
 
4.     ER, a Fire Prevention Officer
for the Cambridge
Fire Department, testified
that he attended the unit on October 13, 2021. The condition of the
Tenant’s unit was concerning because




 
items were blocking
electrical receptacles, he was running extension cords, there was evidence of
smoking material and a large amount of combustibles. On the Clutter Image
Rating Scale, the Tenant’s unit sits at a score of 7-9 but it should be at a 2.
 
5.     Pursuant to section
66 of the Act, a landlord may give a tenant a notice of termination if an
act or omission of the tenant seriously impairs the safety of another person,
provided that the act or omission complained of occurs in the residential
complex.
 
6.     In order to
be successful on this ground, the Landlord must establish that the effect of
the Tenant’s actions threatens the wellbeing or physical integrity of another
person to such a degree that termination of the tenancy
is reasonable in order to ensure the safety of others.
 
7.     In my view, the Tenant’s
excessive number of combustible items in the unit poses a serious risk to the health and safety of
others in the residential complex. I base this on ER’s testimony, that if there
was a fire, there is a large risk of spread to the other units and neighbours
and the fire fighters would have difficulty getting in and out of the unit.
 
 
SECTION 83 CONSIDERATIONS
 
8.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
9.     ER testified that after his November 17, 2021 order,
the Tenant did not comply
by reducing the combustibles
in the unit. SG testified that she had provided the Tenant with multiple
notices and ample time to clean up the unit, but the condition remains the
same. Photographs of the unit taken on December
3, 2021 and January 5, 2022 confirms
as such. She also offered to
haul the Tenant’s excessive items to a dump, but he refused. He was also
offered the assistance of a CMHA worker, but the Tenant declined their
assistance, stating he could clean the unit himself.
 
10.  The Landlord submitted that they would
be prejudiced if the tenancy
continued. Specifically, the
Landlord received a letter issued on January 4, 2022 from the Electrical Safety
Association. An attempt
was made to inspect the Tenant’s electrical units but could not due to the excessive items. The letter
states that the ESA will lay a charge as against the Landlord for refusing or
neglecting to comply with an inspection and
may issue a penalty.
 
11.  In consideration of the foregoing, and the fact that the Tenant did not attend
the hearing to testify to his circumstances for me to
consider refusing or delaying eviction, relief will not be granted.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
February 14, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 15, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.




 
 
 
3.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing on or before February 14, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 15, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit
is not vacated on or before February 14, 2022, then starting February 15, 2022,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
5.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord on or after February 15, 2022. The Sheriff is requested to expedite
the enforcement of this order.
