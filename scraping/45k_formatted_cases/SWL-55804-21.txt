Tenants




 
 
 
Jayson Mead
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict William (bill) Bugler and Julie Bugler (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 27, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Tim Mobberley, attended the hearing. As of 11:17 a.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the
period from September 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October 12, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenants vacated the rental unit on
January 17, 2022. The Tenants
were in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.      The lawful monthly
rent was $2,050.00.
 
4.      The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,050.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from October
1, 2020 to October 12, 2021.




File Number: SWL-55804-21
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     
The Tenancy is terminated as of January 17, 2022, the date the Tenants gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $7,344.46*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to
January 17, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
 
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     
If the Tenants do not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 14, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 15, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
