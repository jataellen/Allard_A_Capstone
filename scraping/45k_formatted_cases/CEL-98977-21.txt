APT 4, 79 1ST AVENUE
S CHESLEY ON N0G1L0


 




Between:


Seven Star Investments Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jeff Cooke
  Jen Coke


Tenants



 
 
Seven Star
Investments Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Jen Coke and Jeff Cooke (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 6, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord
attended the hearing and was represented by Carrie Bertrand. The Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
the hearing by the Board. There
was no record of a request to adjourn the hearing. As a result,
the hearing proceeded with only the Landlord’s evidence, although I did
have the benefit of, and considered, documentary evidence filed by the Tenants,
as set forth further below.
 
James (Jim) Sheppard provided
evidence on behalf
of the Landlord.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
On February
15, 2021, the Landlord served
a N4 notice with a termination date of
March 1, 2021. This application was filed on March 4,
2021.
 
2.   
This application was first scheduled for hearing on June 21, 2021. On that attendance, the
Ms Coke, on behalf of the Tenants,
asserted that the rent the Landlord asserted
was owing had been paid. Ms Coke asserted that the money was sent
to the Landlord by direct deposit/e-transfer and provided screen shots from her
mobile phone that she asserted were evidence of the payment of funds to the
Landlord. After delivering these screen shots,
Ms Coke dropped off the video conference and did not participate further in the
hearing that day.
 
3.   
On reviewing the screen
shots provided by Ms Coke, the Landlord questioned whether they established actual payment of funds because there
appeared to be no confirmation numbers shown on the screen
shorts. The Landlord
provided transaction histories from a




 
CIBC bank
account that did not appear to show payments from Ms Coke, but did not produce a witness to attest to the fact that the e-mail to which Ms Coke ‘s screen shots appeared to indicate money was sent
is “linked” to the bank account for which the statements were provided.
 
4.   
Pursuant to an interim
order dated June 29, 2021, I ordered:
 
1.  
Jen Coke shall, by no later than July 9, 2021, deliver to the Board evidence of the actual payment of the funds she asserts
was paid to the Landlord in respect of the rent the Landlord asserts is
outstanding. This shall include evidence of all of the payments Ms Coke asserts
were made. The evidence shall be in the form of bank statements that
show the withdrawal or payment of funds from the relevant
account and confirmations that the funds were
received by the recipient.
 
2.  
The Landlord
shall, by no later than July 9, 2021, provide to the Board evidence that the
bank account for which statements were produced is “linked” to the e-mail to
which Jen Coke asserts funds were transferred. This may be in the form of a
sworn declaration or affidavit from any person with personal knowledge.
 
5.   
In accordance with my
interim order, the Landlord delivered an affidavit sworn by Mr. Shephard on
July 5, 2021 in which Mr. Sheppard swore, among other things, that: (a) e-
transfers of rent for the residential complex
are linked to the e-mail
greywolf2009@live.ca and are deposited into his account at
CIBC; and (b) he has not received any e-transfers from the Tenants since
December of 2020. Mr. Shephard attached to his affidavit bank statements for
the account into which he asserts tenant rent is deposited.
 
6.   
Ms Coke, for her part, delivered six Interac e-transfer confirmations from CIBC that appear on their face to
indicate that she successfully e-transferred $525.00 on six occasions to a bank account
in the name of Lorraine Shephard. Ms Coke did not, however,
produce bank statements as
directed by me. I was, as a result,
unable to determine whether the e- transfers that Ms Coke asserts were made by
her resulted in funds being transferred from her bank account to that of
Loraine Sheppard. It was also unclear
to me based on the evidence produced by Ms. Coke what connection, if any, Ms
Sheppard had to Mr. Sheppard or the Landlord.
 
7.   
I considered the evidence delivered by the parties
in accordance with my interim
order of June 29, 2021 and
determined that a further attendance was required.
 
8.   
In an endorsement dated
July 13, 2021, I directed that the parties re-attend before me. I further directed that the Landlord was
to have both Mr. Shephard and Ms Sheppard in attendance at the next hearing to provide evidence. I subsequently came to learn that
Ms Sheppard was Mr. Sheppard’s spouse and that she has passed away.
 
7.    
An attendance was
scheduled for August 9, 2021, but that attendance could not take place as a result of technical difficulties and the matter was re-scheduled for December 6, 2021.
 
8.    
As noted above, the Tenants did not appear
before me on December 6,
2021.




 
 
 
9.    
Mr. Sheppard’s evidence
on December 6, 2021 was: (a) he, with the consent of the Landlord, collects the
rent for the residential complex and the tenants either pay the rent into a
personal bank via direct deposit/e-transfer or pay him cash; (b) the e-mail greywolf2009@live.ca is ‘linked’ to a personal
bank account the ownership of which is (or was) held jointly by him and Ms
Sheppard; and (c) he did not receive the rent being claimed by the Landlord
from the Tenants either in cash or via direct deposit/e-transfer.
 
10.  The bank statements that Mr. Sheppard
produced do not show any deposits
from the Tenants.
 
11.  The fact that the Landlord permits Mr.
Sheppard to accept rent into his personal bank account or in cash is not perhaps the best practice,
btu that is the situation
with which I am faced.
 
12.  The documents provide by Ms Coke appear on
their face to indicate that six e-transfers were made to the bank account into
which Mr. Sheppard asserts that tenant rent is paid. Without, however, having
copies of the bank statements that I directed that Ms Coke to produce, I am unable
to verify that the funds actually
left Ms Coke’s bank account and the bank statements for that account produced by Mr. Sheppard do
not show any rent being received from the Tenants.
 
13.  Mr. Sheppard’s unchallenged testimony before me was that no funds have been received from the Tenants either in cash or via
direct deposit/e-transfer since December of 2020. I accept Mr. Sheppard’s evidence. This fact is also verified on the L1/L9
Update Sheet that the Landlord filed for the purpose of the hearing on June 21,
2021 and this hearing, both of which Ms Bertrand certified were true and
correct to the best of her knowledge and belief.
 
14.  Based on the documentary evidence
and the testimony of Mr. Sheppard, I find that the Tenants have not paid the total rent
they were required to pay to the Landlord.
 
15.  The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $525.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord. Interest on the rent
deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from September 1, 2019 to March
1, 2021.
 
16.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. I note that I have delayed having this
order issued to ensure that the Tenants would not be evicted over the holidays.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 15, 2022.




 
 
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$6,913.78*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 4, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $17.26
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 5, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
15, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from January 16,
2022 at .00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 16, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 15, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $8,061.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after January 16, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
