In the matter

Between:


Hongmei Zhang


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Shamar Okyere Quattara


Tenant



 
 
Review Order
 
Hongmei Zhang
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Shamar
Okyere Quattara (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved by order HOL-11795-21 issued on December
14, 2021.
 
On December
29, 2021, the Landlord requested a review of the order and that the order be
stayed until the request to review the order is resolved.
 
On January 7,
2022, interim order HOL-11795-21 -IN was issued, staying the order issued on
December 14, 2021. The Landlord
alleged that they were not reasonably able to participate
in the proceeding.
 
The request
was heard by video conference on January 25, 2022. Only the Landlord and the
Landlord’s brother, J. Zhang attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
The Request
 
1.    
The Landlord
alleged that they were not reasonably able to participate in the original
proceedings of November 30, 2021, which resulted in order HOL-11795-21
dismissing the Landlord’s
application.
2.    
In support of the
request to review the order, the
Landlord stated that they did not receive the Notice of Hearing in the mail and
had subsequently found a copy of order HOL- 11795-21 in their junk mailbox. As the Landlord’s junk mail
clears every month, they were unable to confirm receipt of the Notice of
Hearing.
3.    
The records show
that the Notice of Hearing was sent by email only to the Landlord on September
23, 2021. Based on the submissions made in the request, I am satisfied that




 
the Landlord
was not reasonably able to participate in the proceeding. Therefore, the
Landlord’s application was heard afresh.
The L1 Application
4.    
The Tenant has not paid the total
rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from December 1, 2020 to November 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a
Notice of Termination effective August 17, 2021.
 
5.    
On January 18, 2022, the Landlord
attended the rental unit for a discussion with the Tenant. The Landlord
discovered the door to the rental unit unlocked with the keys to the unit on
the countertop. The Landlord was not informed prior that the Tenant was
vacating the rental unit.
 
6.    
The lawful monthly rent is $1,900.00.
 
7.    
The Tenant made no payments after the application was filed.
 
8.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,900.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
 
9.     Interest on
the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from October 22, 2020 to August 17, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The request to review order HOL-11795-21 issued on
December 14, 2021, is granted. The order cannot be enforced.
 
2.    
The interim order issued
on January 7, 2022 is cancelled and replaced with this order.
 
3.     The tenancy is terminated as of January 18, 2022, the
date the Landlord discovered the Tenant vacated the rental unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $20,980.74*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January 18,
2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
5.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before February 18, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
