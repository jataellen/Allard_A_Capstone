Residential Tenancies Act, 2006


 




 


File Number: TSL-17759-20




 
In the matter
of:


 
2nd & 3rd FLOOR, 247 CONCORD
AVENUE TORONTO, ON M6H 2P4


 




 
Between:


 
Michael Nolet


 
Landlord




 


and


 




 


 
Christine Ibrahim


 
Tenant



 
 
 
Michael Nolet (the
'Landlord') made an L1 application for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Christine Ibrahim (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owe.
 
This application was adjourned on
consent from March 3, 2021 since both legal representatives had been recently
retained at that time and the parties wanted time to try to resolve. There was no resolution reached so the application was heard by telephone/video-conference on December
2, 2021. The Landlord attended
the hearing with his legal representative Bita Di Lisi. The Tenant also attended the hearing with her
legal representative Daniel McIntyre.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The parties agreed that the Tenant
had vacated the rental unit on January
15, 2021. The L1 application was converted to an L9
application since an eviction order was no longer necessary due to the
agreed-upon vacate date.
 
2.       
The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit at the time the L1 application was filed.
 
3.       
The monthly
rent was $4,200.00
for the duration of arrears
claimed. Rent was due on the
first (1st) day of
each month.
 
4.       
The Tenant failed to pay the total
rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from June 1, 2020 to the vacate
date January 15, 2021. The parties agreed
that a payment of
$4,200.00 made September 8, 2021 had not
been reflected on the L1 application which was filed on September 15, 2021. (The payment of $4,200.00 made September 8, 2021
was credited and accounted for in the calculations below.)




 
5.       
The Tenant paid $10,400.00 since the application was filed but before the hearing date.
 
6.       
On December 1, 2019 the Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $4,200.00 from the Tenant which is still being held by the
Landlord. Interest is owing on the
rent deposit from the date of collection to the vacate date.
 
7.       
The Landlord incurred NSF fees of $20.00 each during the months June 2020 and August 2020 as a result of bounced
cheques submitted by the Tenant.
 
8.       
The Tenant was not permitted to
raise section 82 issues since the description of issues were lacking in the
form titled “Issues a Tenant Intends to Raise At a Rent Arrears Hearing”. For
example, all of the issues listed failed to mention when the Tenant told the
Landlord about the issue. Some of the issues
only contained a date range
such as “since April 2020” or “throughout tenancy”. There was also a draft T2 application submitted but it also failed to
contain the minimum amount of detail required for the Landlord to understand
the issues being raised and to properly prepare or defend against them. Since the Tenant could bring her own T2 application for the issues
claimed, and since the
details were lacking on the section 82 form in any event, no maintenance issues
or rent abatement were contemplated in this hearing.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The tenancy is terminated as of January
15, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.       
If the Tenant made any payments
to the Landlord after the hearing
on December 2, 2021
but before the issuance date of this order, those amounts shall be deducted
from the calculations below.
 
See attached
Schedule 1: Summary
of Calculations
 
3.       
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $4,372.62**, which represents the amount of rent owing up to the vacate
date January 15, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest owing on
the deposit.
 
4.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $40.00 for the cost of reimbursing for the NSF charges.




 
6.       
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing of $4,613.62** ** on or before February
6, 2022 (standard 11 days from the issuance date of this order), the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February
7, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
