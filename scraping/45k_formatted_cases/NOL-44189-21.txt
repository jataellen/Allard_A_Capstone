Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44189-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


2, 405
KING STREET N SUDBURY ON P3B2K9


 




Between:


Israël N’sana


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Misty Assinewai


Tenant



 
 
 
Israël N’sana (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Misty Assinewai (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully caused
undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
988 4914 7021# on February
7, 2022. The Landlord,
represented by Daniellle Barham, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The notice served on the Tenant under section 63 of the Residential Tenancies Act is
for wilful damage. A notice served
under this section is based on a serious breach of the Act. This is demonstrated by the fact a tenant
has no chance to remedy
the damage, the application is expedited to a
hearing, and the Sheriff is directed to give priority to the eviction over all
other orders.
 
2.    
The allegation in the Landlord’s notice is that there was a break-in
at the Tenant’s apartment and that the Tenant or a guest broke the
window.
 
3.     There is also a claim that someone
had a key to the Tenant’s unit claiming he was
allowed into the unit, that there are needles around and that the unit is
dirty.
 
4.     I find these
allegations are not of the serious nature
as required under
section 63 of the
Act. As such, this tenancy cannot be
terminated based on this notice.
 
5.     At the hearing
the Landlord chose to pursue the request
for compensation for the
damage caused to the window.




File Number: NOL-44189-21
 
6.    
Based on the evidence
and the submission from the Landlord, I find will incur costs
of
$500.00 to repair the broken
window.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$500.00, which represents the reasonable costs of
repairing the broken window.
 
2.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
February 19, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 20, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
