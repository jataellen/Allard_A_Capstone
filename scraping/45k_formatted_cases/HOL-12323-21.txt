In the
  matter of:


42-01, 2420
BARONWOOD DRIVE OAKVILLE ON
  L6M0X6


 




Between:


Emile
  Tchaptchet


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Colette Scoburgh
  Paul Davis


Tenants



 
 
 
Emile Tchaptchet (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Colette Scoburgh and Paul Davis (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 25, 2022. Only the Landlord and the Landlord’s Legal
Representative, Arashdeep Grewal,
attended the hearing.
As of 10:29 a.m., the Tenants were not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from July 2, 2019 to February 1,
2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October 5, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $2,100.00.
 
4.    
The Tenants have made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $2,100.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from May 2, 2019 to
October 5, 2021.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on
the




 
parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenants, and find
that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 11, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$20,797.34*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 31, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$69.04 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 1, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
11, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 12, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 11, 2022, then starting February
12, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 12, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)          
$23,386.00 if the payment is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)         
$25,486.00 if the payment is made on or before
February 11, 2022**.
If the
Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 12, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
