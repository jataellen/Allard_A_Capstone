In the matter

8, 1335
NIAGARA STREET WINDSOR ON

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Michael Rainone


Tenant



 
 
 
Marda Management Inc (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Michael Rainone (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord intends to demolish the
rental unit. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on January 21, 2022.
 
The landlord Judy Kaake, the Landlord’s representative K. Passell,
the Tenant Michael
Rainone, the tenant’s legal representative, J. Levesques attended the
hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
On September 1, 2021, the Landlord
served the Tenant with an N13 Notice
to Terminate the Tenancy
because the owner intends to demolish the unit pursuant to subsection 50
(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’)
 
2.       
Section 52 (1) of the Act provides
that, in these circumstances, the Landlord must pay compensation equal to three month’s rent to the Tenant or offer the tenant another
rental unit the tenant finds acceptable.
 
3.       
Section 55.1 of the Act requires
that this compensation be paid no later than the
termination date in the notice served.
 
4.       
The termination date on the N13 Notice was December 31,
2021
 
5.       
The Landlord informed the Tenant
that he was not required to pay his rent for three months and that this would serve as the compensation the Landlord is required to pay to the Tenant.

6.       
The Landlord provided the Tenant with a cheque
on January 15, 2022, this is 15 days
after the notice of termination as indicated on the N13 Notice.
 
7.       
At the hearing the tenant testified that he continued paying
his rent because he did not agree with
the N13 notice that was served on him.
 
8.       
The question before me is whether
the Landlord fulfilled its obligations to compensate the Tenant according to the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the’Act’). Because the Tenant intended to dispute the
Landlord’s application, he continued to pay his rent and the Landlord did not
take any additional steps to compensate the Tenant until after the termination
date on the N13 Notice.
 
9.       
Because the Landlord failed
to comply with section 55.1 of the Act, the Board
has no authority to terminate
the tenancy under these circumstances.
 
10.   This order contains
all the reasons
in this matter and no further reasons
will be issued.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The Landlord's application is dismissed.
 
February 17, 2022
