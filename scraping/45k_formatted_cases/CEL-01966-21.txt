In the matter
of:


3914 PINE ROCK AVENUE
  INNISFIL ON L9S2L6


 




Between:


Onaiza Kazi Mufeed Mohammad


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Graham M Isabel Graham Vaughn
Anthony


Tenants



 
 
 
Onaiza Kazi and
Mufeed Mohammad (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Graham
M Isabel and Graham Vaughn
Anthony (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord
requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
The Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in
the unit after the termination date.
 
This application
was heard by way of video conference on October 14, 2021. The Landlords attended the hearing and were represented by Atta Choudhry,
Paralegal. The Tenant Graham
Vaughn Anthony attended and was self represented.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
The Landlord’s application is based on an N12 notice
of termination served
to the Tenants on August 5, 2021 with a termination date of October
31, 2021. The N12 states that the
Landlord requires the rental unit for residential occupation.
 
2.   
The Landlord
has provided a declaration signed
by the person who personally requires the rental
unit certifying that the person in good faith requires the rental unit for his
or her own personal use for a minimum of 1 year.
 
Compensation:
 
3.   
Section 48.1 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the Act) states
 
48.1 A landlord shall compensate a
tenant in an amount equal to one month’s rent or offer the tenant another
rental unit acceptable to the tenant
if the landlord gives the tenant a notice of termination of the
tenancy under section 48.




 
 
 
 
4.   
The Landlord’s legal
representative submitted two screen shots showing that on two separate
occasions the Landlord attempted to make an E-transfer to the Tenant in the
amount of $2,000.00 to satisfy section 48.1 of the Act (LL exhibit #1). The first interact E- transfer was dated
for August 3, 2021 with an expiry date to be accept by September 2, 2021. The Tenant did not accept the E-transfer
and as such, the Landlord cancelled the E-transfer on August 29, 2021. The Landlord sent the Tenant a
second interact E-transfer on October 12, 2021 and as of
the date of the hearing, the Tenant had not accepted the payment.
 
5.   
The Tenant testified that the Landlord
did not pay him compensation equal to one month’s
rent because he did not accept the E-transfer payment.      The Tenant
acknowledges receiving notification of the Landlord’s E-transfer payment on
August 3, 2021 and that he did not accept and/or deposit it into his account. When asked why, the Tenant testified that
he did not know what the payment was for.
 
6.   
I find it unlikely that the Tenant was unaware that the
Landlord was attempting to pay him
compensation related to the N12 notice. The E-transfer sent on August 3, 2021
had a memo attached to it stating “N12 Compensation”. The Landlord also sent the Tenant an email the same day advising of the password
to accept the payment
and in that email, the subject line was “N12 Compensation”. Further,
the Tenant received
the N12 notice shortly after the August interact
E-transfer was sent informing him of the Landlord’s obligation to pay
compensation equal to one month’s rent. Therefore, the Tenant should have been
expecting to receive a payment to satisfy the Landlord’s requirement to pay
one-months rent compensation. The Tenant provided no explanation as to why he
did not accept the October 12, 2021 E-transfer.
 
7.   
The wording in section
48.1 is clear that the Landlord must pay to the Tenant the one month’s rent compensation and the Landlord
has done that on two occasions. The Tenant
refusing to accept or deposit the payment does not mean that the Landlord has
not met their statutory obligation.
 
8.   
As such, I find that the Landlord has paid to the Tenant compensation in the amount of one month’s rent. As of the date of the hearing, the Tenant had not yet deposited
the October 12, 2021 payment. If the
Tenant has not yet deposited these funds, then the Tenant’s obligation to pay
rent for the month of January 2022 is waived.
 
Landlord’s evidence:
 
9.   
The Landlord Mufeed
Muhammad testified that he requires the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlords assumed the tenancy when purchasing the rental
unit in March 2021. Mr. Muhammad testified
that the Tenant initially told him that he would move out of the rental unit when the
property was purchased but did not.
 
10. Mr. Muhammad intends to reside in the
rental unit as his primary residence with his common law spouse and child. Currently
Mr. Muhammad is renting a basement apartment




 
in Thornhill, Ontario for $2,650.00
per month. The Landlord entered
into evidence a copy
of the witness’s current lease agreement (LL exhibit #2). The rental unit is close to his workplace
and that he cannot financially afford to pay for both the mortgage on the
property and his current rental unit.
 
11. Onaiza Kazi was called as the Landlord’s
second witness and testified that she is the Cousin of the other Landlord and purchased the property with him from her mother
back in March 2021. Ms. Kazi does not intend to move into the
rental unit as she is currently taking care of her mother who is ill with
cancer.
 
12. When asked why in March 2021 the parties did not serve an N12 for purchaser’s own use pursuant to
section 49 of the Act, Ms. Kazi testified that they were under the impression
that the Tenant would vacate as agreed upon and because the purchase was done
between immediate family.
 
13. Under cross examination Ms. Kazi agreed
that the Landlord had served a previous N12 notice on May 25, 2021. At the hearing on August 5, 2021, the application was dismissed without prejudice as the Landlord’s notice of termination was not served sixty days prior to the termination date on the notice.
 
Tenant’s evidence:
 
14. The Tenant disputes the Landlord’s N12
notice and contests the good faith of the Landlords. The Tenant testified
that the Landlord’s originally told him that Onaiza and her child would move into the rental unit
and now on this N12, he is being told that Mr. Muhammad requires the rental
unit for his own use. The Tenant
provided a copy of the previous N12 form (TT exhibit #1). On review of the previous N12 notice, it
is clear that the N12 was signed by each of the Landlords. The Landlords stated during cross
examination and on submission that the intention remained the same through both
N12 notices.
 
15. The Tenant further
testified that on or about April 2, 2021, the Landlord Onaiza entered the rental unit with a contractor who was
to examine the rental unit for repairs. The
Tenant testified that during the inspection, it appeared that the contractor was in fact a prospective tenant and was not actually
examining the reported repairs. The
Landlord’s disputed this allegation and the Tenant provided no evidence to
support this allegation.
 
16. On June 1, 2021 the Tenant testified
that a contractor entered the rental unit to do repairs
and advised him that he was intending to move into the rental unit and was
going to pay
the Landlord’s
$2,700.00 in rent. The Police were
contacted during the dispute and advised the parties to proceed with the
Landlord and Tenant Board proceedings. The
Landlord disputes that this individual was a prospect tenant and has no knowledge of the
discussion.
 
17. The Tenant finally stated that the Landlord
had prior to the N12 frequently visited the property asking the Tenant to
vacate the rental unit. The Tenant
stated that if ordered to vacate, he would require approximately 5 months to find alternative accommodation as he is separated and has joint custody of
his two children ages 11 and 18 years old.




 
Analysis:
 
18.
The N12 was served pursuant to section 48(1) of the Act which states in part:
 
48 (1) A landlord may, by notice, terminate a tenancy if the landlord in
good faith requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation for a period of at
least one year by,
 
(a) The landlord;
 
19.
In Feeney
v. Noble, 1994 CanLII 10538 (ON SC), the Court held that the test of good
faith is genuine intention to occupy the premises and not the reasonableness of
the Landlord’s proposal. This
principle was upheld in Salter v. Beljinac 2001 CanLII 40231 (ON SCDC),
where the Court held that the
“good faith” requirement simply means that a sincere intends to occupy the rental unit. The
Landlord may also have additional motives for selecting a particular rental
unit, but this does not affect the good faith of the Landlord’s notice.”
 
20. In the more recent case of Fava v.
Harrison, [2014] O.J No. 2678 ONSC 3352 (Ont.Div.Ct.) the Court determined
that while the motives of the Landlord are, per Salter, “largely irrelevant”,
the Board can consider the conduct and motives of the Landlord to draw inferences as to whether
the Landlord desires,
in good faith to occupy the property.”
 
21.
Based
on the evidence before the Board, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities
that the Landlord genuinely intends to live in the rental
unit for at least one
year . The Landlord Mufeed Mohammad provided consistent and credible
evidence that he is currently renting another rental unit and would like to
move into the rental unit with his family for financial reasons. With respect to the Tenant’s
assertions that the Landlord already has plans to re- rent the unit at a higher rent, the
Tenant provided no concrete evidence to support this allegation. Both Landlord’s dispute the alleged discussion on June 1, 2021 and the Tenant had no witnesses to add additional testimony to his allegation. The only agreed fact of this incident is that the Police were called and that the
parties had a dispute.
 
Relief from eviction:
 
 
22. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until February 28, 2021 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
23.
The Tenant stated that he has been actively
looking for a new rental
unit since April 2021
and has found it difficult
to secure a new rental unit, The Tenant has joint custody of two
children and has no alternative housing should he be evicted in a standard
time.




 
24. This order is being issued
more than 2 months from the date of hearing,
meaning the Tenant has
already effectively benefitted from a delay in the eviction. I respect the
Tenant’s
circumstances and note that this is a no-fault termination of tenancy. I also note however, that the Tenant has been made aware of the
Landlord’s intentions for some time and that further
delay would result
in the Landlord incurring additional financial hardship as he is renting a property and paying a
current mortgage on the rental unit.
 
25.
This Order contains all the reasons
for this matter.
No further reasons
will issue.
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlords
and the Tenants is terminated, as of February
28, 2022. The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before February 28, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlords
$3,935.28, which represents compensation for the
use of the unit from November 1, 2021 to December 27, 2021.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlords $69.04
per day for compensation for the use of the unit from December 28, 2021 to
the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlords the full amount owing on or before January 7, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 8, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the Landlords may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after March 1, 2022.
