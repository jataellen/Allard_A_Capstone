Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44701-22
 
 



In the
  matter of:


404,
  652 MACDONALD AVENUE SAULT STE. MARIE
ON P6B5W4


 




Between:


Strategic Growth
Realty Group Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Joe Bernardi


Tenant



 
 
 
Strategic Growth Realty Group
Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Joe Bernardi (the 'Tenant') and for
an order to have the Tenant
pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board
on January 20, 2022 with respect to application NOL-44098-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenant failed to pay $700.00 towards
the arrears, on or before January 18, 2022.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order
required the Tenant
to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $2,112.16 for rent
arrears and NSF cheque charges and the costs related to the Landlord's
application fee in Order NOL-44098-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $2,112.16 and that amount
is included in this order.
As a result, the previous order NOL-44098-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $930.00
from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period from November
18, 2019 to February 7, 2022.




File Number: NOL-44701-22
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order NOL-44098-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 18, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
pay to the Landlord $1,377.30*. This amount represents the rent owing up to February 7, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$30.94 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 8, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 18, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
February 19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 18, 2022, then starting February
19, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 19, 2022.
 
 
February 7, 2022

The tenant has until February 17, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by February 17, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on August 19, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
