Review Order
 
Michael Adams (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Riccardo Luigi Gagliardi (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
Procedural history:
 
This application was heard via videoconference on June 15, 2021. The Landlord’s Legal Representative and Ricardo
Gagliardi on behalf of all Tenants attended the hearing
 
This application was resolved
by order SOL-18317-20 issued
on July 29, 2021.
 
On August 17, 2021 Riccardo Luigi
Gagliardi and Desiree Lynn O'Soup requested that order SOL-18317-20 be reviewed and that the order be stayed until
their request to review the order is resolved.
 
On August 19, 2021,
interim order SOL-18317-20-RV-IN was issued, staying
the order issued
on July 29, 2021.
 
The Tenants’ review request
was heard by videoconference on November 19, 2021 at 4:02 PM. Michael Adams (the 'Landlord'), the Landlord’s representative, Peter Balatidis, and the Tenants,




 
Riccardo Luigi Gagliardi and Desiree Lynn O'Soup,
attended the hearing. Matthew O’Soup provided testimony for the
Tenants.
 
The review was granted
and a hearing do novo commenced, with determinations made in Interim Order SOL-18317-20-RV-IN2 issued
on November 25, 2021, which removed Desiree Lynn
O’Soup from the application. There was inadequate time to complete
the hearing, and it was adjourned.
 
The reconvened review hearing
was heard by videoconference on December 15, 2021. At 10:30
AM, the Tenant Riccardo Luigi Gagliardi was in attendance, but the Landlord was
neither in attendance nor represented, despite being served with a Notice of
Hearing by the Board. For reasons
contained in Interim Order SOL-18317-20-RV-IN3 issued January 4, 2022, the
matter was reconvened before any order final issued arising from the Landlord’s
non-attendance at the hearing of December
15, 2021, based on the Landlord
and his representative being unable
to log in successfully to the
Board’s Zoom platform.
 
The reconvened review hearing
was heard by videoconference on January 25, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord and the Landlord’s representative, Peter Balatidis, attended
the reconvened hearing on January
25, 2022. At 1:30 PM, being
thirty minutes after the hearing time noted on the Notice of Hearing, the Tenant was not in attendance or represented, nor noted in the Zoom waiting room, but had been properly
served with a Notice of Hearing by the Board.
 
In light of previous
Zoom connectivity issues
at the previous reconvened hearing
of December 15, 2021, Interim Order
SOL-18317-20-RV-IN3 issued January 4, 2022 contained the following provision to
address the contingency that a party might further be unable reasonably to participate because of any fault in the
Board’s videoconferencing technology:
 
Should either party experience difficulty logging onto the Zoom session for the reconvened hearing more than five minutes
after the start time noted on the Notice of Hearing, that party is to e-mail a
description of the problem to ltb.hearing@ontario.ca,
noting the file number and the adjudicator’s name in the subject line, and
provide a brief description of the login issue. If a party is not present, and no such e-mail is received within
thirty minutes following the start time noted on the Notice of Hearing, the
reconvened hearing may proceed in the non-attending party’s absence.
 
On January
25, 2022, I began monitoring the noted e-mail
address at 1:05 PM, and as at 1:30
PM there had been no such e-mail sent by the Tenant.
 
The Tenant had submitted a Request to Reschedule a Hearing to the Board
on January 24, 2022,
which had not been actioned by the time the hearing was held. In accordance with Rule 21.1 of
the Board’s Rules of Procedure, a “request to reschedule must be on consent of all parties”. The Board’s Request to Reschedule a Hearing form also contains a
caution that is substantively the same as the contents of Rule 21.1. Tenant’s request acknowledged that he had not
received the consent of the Landlord or his representative.
 
The Board’s Request to Reschedule
a Hearing to the Board form also contains the following caution that is reflective of Rule 21.4 of the Board’s
Rules of Procedure: “It is the responsibility of




 
the parties or their representatives to contact the Board to determine if the
rescheduling request has been
granted.” There is nothing in the
Board’s records available to me to suggest that the Tenant made any such
contact with the Board.
 
The Landlord’s Representative
advised at the January 25, 2022 hearing that he had also attempted to contact the Tenant at around 1:00 PM on the hearing
day to remind him of the hearing, with no reply.
 
I am therefore satisfied that the
Tenant had actual notice of the hearing on January 25, 2022, based on the fact he submitted a request to reschedule the hearing
and communicated with the Board. As
the Tenant did not receive confirmation from the Board that his request had
been granted, he should
have attended the hearing, either
to request an adjournment or proceed with the hearing. Further, he did not bring to my attention any technological
issue that might have precluded his ability to reasonably participate in the
reconvened hearing in accordance with my instructions on Interim Order
SOL-18317-20-RV-IN3.
 
The reconvened hearing
of January 25, 2022 therefore
commenced and was heard in the
Tenant’s absence.
 
After the hearing concluded the
Tenant sent an e-mail to the Board, indicating that he had been feeling unwell,
and not woken up until 3:00 PM on the day of the hearing.
While I am prepared to exercise discretion to reconvene a
hearing when an inability to participate rests with difficulties with a
technology platform that is provided by the Board (as I did after the December
15, 2021 hearing), I am not prepared
to exercise such discretion when a
party failed to wake up in time for a hearing of which they had full knowledge.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
My previous determinations granting
the review and making determinations on the status of certain parties status as tenants
are contained in Interim Order SOL-18317-20-RV-IN2 dated November
25, 2021, and are by reference reaffirmed in this order.
 
2.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period from August 25, 2020 to January 24, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective November 29, 2020.
 
3.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.     As the monthly
rent was previously contested by the Tenant, who claimed it was $1,500 per month, the Landlord introduced
into evidence a text message from the Tenant from late 2020 which reads
“Property is 4 k a month. Not 6.” The
Landlord’s testimony was that the test related to the rental unit that forms
the subject matter of the application.
 
6.    
I therefore find on a balance of probabilities based on the evidence
before me that the monthly lawful rent is $4,000.00, which was the lawful rent that formed the basis of the N4 notice of termination that forms
the basis of this application.




 
7.    
The Landlord is not holding a rent deposit.
 
8.    
The Landlords
claim in this application exceeds the Board’s jurisdictional limit as set out in s.207(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) of $35,000.00, that being the limit of the Small Claims Court. The Landlord acceded to the jurisdiction
of the Board and waived any claim above this limitation.
 
9.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and of the Landlords efforts to negotiate a
repayment plan with the Tenants and of COVID-19, and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     Order SOL-18317-20 issued on July 29, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the following:
 
2.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 12, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$35,000.00*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 1, 2022.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 12, 2022, then starting
February 13, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 13, 2022.
 
7.     If, on or before February 12, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $72,186.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 13, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
