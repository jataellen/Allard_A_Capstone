Sujanthan Krishnalingam (the

did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 24, 2022. Only the Landlord
attended the hearing. As of 11:37 a.m., the Tenant was not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.

Termination effective September 30, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on December
5, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $2,125.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of December
5, 2021, the date the Tenant returned
vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$5,956.65*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to December 5, 2021.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.

does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
