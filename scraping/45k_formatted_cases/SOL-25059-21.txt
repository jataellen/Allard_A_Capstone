In the matter
of:


B, 75 EDINBURGH ROAD
N GUELPH ON N1H5R1


 




Between:


George Carere


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Real Beaulieu


Tenant



 
 
 
George Carere (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Real Beaulieu (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant has been persistently late in paying
the Tenant's rent.
 
This application was heard via video conference on January 5, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Amanda
Moniz, attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant persistently failed to
pay rent when it was due.
 
2.    
The Tenant moved into the rental
unit in January, 2020. A standard
lease was signed with rent due on the first of the
month and the tenancy is month to month.
 
3.     The Landlord testified that the Tenant has persistently failed to pay the lawful
rent on the date it was due; the rent has been paid late seven times
since the beginning of the tenancy in 2020 and
no rent was paid for the months of August,
September and October, 2021. The Tenant did pay $1,300.00 to the Landlord in November, 2021.
 
4.     Section 58 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, (the ‘Act’) sets out that a landlord may give a tenant notice of termination of their tenancy if the
tenant has persistently failed to pay rent on the date it becomes due and
payable (N8 notice). The Landlord
served the Tenants with a N8 notice on September 7, 2021 that is effective
November 30, 2021. I accept the
uncontested testimony and evidence of the Landlord and am satisfied, on a
balance of probabilities, that the
Tenant has persistently failed to pay the
rent on the date it was due.




 
Section 83 considerations
 
5.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
6.     The Landlord was seeking a conditional pay-on-time
order as the impact of the COVID pandemic has made it difficult for the tenant
to meet their financial obligations. The
Landlord’s uncontested evidence established that the Tenant persistently paid
late. I find that a pay-on-time order
is appropriate in these circumstances. As
termination is a remedy of last resort, I find the Tenant should be given another opportunity with a pay-on- time order.
 
7.    
The Landlord has incurred
the cost of $186.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay
to the Landlord the full rent owing on or before
the first day of each month, commencing February 1, 2022
and for 12 months thereafter up to and including February 1, 2023.
 
2.     If the Tenant fails to comply with the conditions set out in paragraph 1 above, then, within
30 days of the breach, the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenant.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
this application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing on or before March 1, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 2, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
