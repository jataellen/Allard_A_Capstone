Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-17427-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


LOWER UNIT, 4 ALBERT STREET LANGTON ON N0E1G0


 




Between:


Sunny Abraham


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Stan Butler


Tenant



 
 
 
Sunny Abraham (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Stan Butler (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on December 20, 2021.
 
The Landlord, the Tenant,
and the Tenant's Legal Representative, Kimberley Farrell, attended
the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period from December
1, 2019 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 31, 2020.
 
2.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $425.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
3.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenant for the period from October 2, 2020 to August 31, 2020.
 
4.     The Tenant paid $2,550.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.     At the time of hearing the Landlord testified that the
Tenant owed $1, 275.00 in arrears for
December 2019, January and February 2020 plus $99.87 that was deducted from May 2021 rent for hydro
with his permission, and the application filing fee of $186.00
for a total of $1,560.87. He
is seeking a standard 11-day voidable order, he has financial difficulties and
cannot afford for the Tenant to pay via a repayment plan.
 
6.    
The Tenant testified that he paid the rent to Venture
Norfolk for the above months,
as per the assignment
requirement.




File Number: SOL-17427-20
 
 
 
7.    
The Landlord submitted that when Venture
Norfolk receives money, they usually
email him immediately; he has not received anything from them about this
money.
 
8.     The Landlord was required to contact Venture
Norfolk to enquire
about whether they had
the Tenant’s cheques for the months in question and to advise the Tenant
and the Board of the response. If Norfolk Venture does not have the
Tenant’s cheques, the Tenant will re-submit new cheques
to the company by January
4, 2022, for the months
of December 2019, January
2020 and February 2020.
 
9.     On December 27,
2021 the Landlord submitted the email
from Venture Norfolk indicating that they did not have the Tenant’s cheques
for the months
in question. Therefore, based on this evidence I find that the Tenant owes $1,275.00 in
arrears of rent for the month of December 2019, January 2020 and February 2020.
 
10.  With respect to the $99.87 deduction from the rent due
May 2021, the Tenant did this without the Landlord’s permission. The only monies
a Tenant is entitled to unilaterally deduct
from their rent is last month
rent deposit interest
pursuant to section
106(9) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’). Therefore, I find this money was not lawfully deducted and as such is
also arrears owing to the Landlord.
 
11.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until March 16, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. The
Tenant requested 30 days from the date of the order to pay the amount owing
from May 2021 if it was ordered as owed. This request is reasonable plus if not
already done, this gives the Tenant time to re-submit the requisite cheques to
Venture Norfolk.
 
12.  Any payments made since the date of earing and prior to the issuance
of this order shall be deducted from the amount set out below.
 
13.  This order contains
all the reasons for the decision within
it. No further reasons shall be
issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before
March 16, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4,471.80*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
15, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$13.97 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 16, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.




File Number: SOL-17427-20
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before March 16, 2022, the Tenant will start to
owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 17, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 16, 2022, then starting March 17,
2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 17, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant
must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$,410.87 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022,
or
ii)             
$2,835.87 if the payment
is made on or before
March 16, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after
April 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to
the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
