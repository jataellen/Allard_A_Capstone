In the matter
of:


B (BASEMENT), 39 DUNDAS CRESCENT ST. CATHARINES ON L2T1T3


 




Between:


Norbert Krawiec Irinel Georgiana Dini


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Rebecca
Mitchell


Tenant



 
 
Norbert Krawiec
and Irinel Georgiana Dini (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Rebecca Mitchell
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on January 11, 2022. The Landlords’ Legal
Representative, Kelly Hawkes
and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
The Tenant spoke
with Duty Counsel prior to
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant
has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from September 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords
served a Notice of Termination
effective September 16, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,400.00.
 
4.    
The Landlords collected a rent deposit of $1,400.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 15, 2019 to September 16, 2021.
 
6.    
The Tenant
paid $700.00 after
the application was filed.
 
7.    
It is undisputed the total rent arrears owing to the Landlord by the Tenant
up to January 31, 2022 is $6,300.00.




 
8.    
The Tenant stated she
resides in the rental unit with her 2 year old son and has been struggling
financially since the father of her child moved out. She said she has received
assurance from Ontario Works they will cover the total cost of her monthly rent and she is
working on securing financial support from the father of her child. She also
expects to begin working again soon. Presently
in addition to her rent she can pay $40.00
per month but expects that to
increase when she begins working. At minimum she requested the Board delay an
eviction in order to allow her to find alternative housing; without such delay
she believes her and her child will be homeless.
 
9.    
The Landlord is seeking
an order which would terminate the tenancy as soon as possible as the Landlord
is a small landlord who is significantly impacted when the Tenant does not pay
her rent. Further, the Landlord believes the Tenant’s proposed repayment plan
is prejudicial due to the significant length and further
the Tenant has not shown good faith in
her dealings with the Landlord.
 
10.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including the Tenant’s personal and financial
circumstances and weighed this against any potential prejudice to the Landlord
and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $6,486.00, which represents the arrears of rent
($6,300.00), and costs ($186.00) outstanding for the period ending January 31,
2022.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s application for eviction
of the Tenant is denied
on the condition that:
 
(a)  
The Tenant
shall make the following payments
to the Landlord in respect
of the monies owing under
paragraph 1 of this order:
 



Date
Payment Due


Amount of Payment




February 1, 2022


$40.00




March 1, 2022


$40.00




March 31, 2022


$6,406.00



 
 
(b)  
The Tenant
shall also pay the Landlord
the rent for the months
of February and March 2022 in
full, on or before the first day of each month.
 
3.    
If the Tenant fails to make any
of the payments in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates required, then:




 
(a)   The Landlord may apply under section 78 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order terminating
the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, and for the payment of any new arrears of
rent and NSF charges not already ordered under paragraph 1 of this order. The
Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a breach of a condition
set out in paragraph 2 of this order.
 
(b)   The balance owing under paragraph 1 of this
order shall become payable on the day following the date of default.
The monies owing shall bear interest
at the post-judgment interest
rate determined under subsection 207(7) of the Act.
