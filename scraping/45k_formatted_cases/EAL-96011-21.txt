Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number: EAL-96011-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
C, 999 MORRISON DRIVE OTTAWA ON K2H7L1


 




Between:


Logement Communautaire D'ottawa


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Hymelle Pyzza N'doudy


Tenant



 
 
 
Logement Communautaire D'ottawa (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Hymelle
Pyzza N'doudy (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 6,
2021.
 
Only the Landlord’s Agent,
Beth Cumming, attended the hearing.
As of 1:41 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the
hearing, although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
August 1, 2020 to October 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October
29, 2020.
 
2.     The Tenant paid $1,200.00 after the application was filed.
 
3.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. Based on the uncontested evidence provided
by the Landlord at the hearing, I find that the Tenant failed to pay their rent in full. I have no reason to
deny the eviction requested by the Landlord.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 5, 2022.




File Number: EAL-96011-21
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,699.95*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 22, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $5.39 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 23, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before March 5, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 6, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 5, 2022, then starting March 6, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 6, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$2,813.00 if the payment
is made on or before February 28, 2022, or
ii)             
$3,045.00 if the payment
is made on or before
March 5, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after March
6, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
