Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26914-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


30,
  494 WEST STREET BRANTFORD ON N3R3W7


 




Between:


Jashim Uddin


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Lori Scott Steven
Scott


Tenants



 
 
On February 4, 2022, Jashim Uddin (the 'Landlord') applied for
an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Lori Scott and Steven Scott (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the
rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the
order issued by the Board on October 5, 2021 with respect to application
SOL-22721-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I
find that the Tenants have not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenants failed to pay to the Landlord
$100.00 on or before February 1, 2022 towards
arrears of rent. The Tenants
failed to pay to the Landlord
the lawful rent in full, on or
before February 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $900.00
for rent arrears
in Order SOL-22721-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $100.00 and
that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order SOL-22721-21
is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenants
have also failed to pay the full rent that
became owing for the period from February 1, 2022 to February 28, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,600.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order SOL-22721-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before March 7, 2022.
 
3.    
As of the date of this order, the
Tenant owes no money to the Landlord because the amount of the rent owing up to February
24, 2022, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds
the amount , that the Landlord is entitled to under this order by $222.38.
 
4.    
The Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenant:
$53.23 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 25,
2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.    
The Landlord or the Tenant shall pay any amounts that become owing as a result of this
order.
 
6.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before
March 7, 2022, the Tenants will start
to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 8, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
7.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 7, 2022, then starting March 8, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 8, 2022.
