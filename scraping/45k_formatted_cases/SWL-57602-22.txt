Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57602-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


258 MAIN STREET
WEST
TOWN OF KINGSVILLE ON N9Y3M9


 




Between:


Rudy Mastronardi


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


John Micallef Sheri
Anstett-Nael


Tenants



 
 
 
Rudy Mastronardi (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sheri Anstett-Nael and John Micallef
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants entered
into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord and the Tenants
signed an agreement
to terminate the tenancy as of March 1, 2022.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before March 1, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 1, 2022, then starting March 2, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 2, 2022.

The tenant has until February 10, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under

the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on September 2, 2022 if the order has not
been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
