Order under Section

Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-34555-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


107, 437 GLEN
PARK AVENUE TORONTO ON
  M6B2E8


 




Between:


Ijj Properties Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Yetunde
Ajasin


Tenant



 
 
 
Ijj Properties Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Yetunde Ajasin (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 988 4914 7021# on January
6, 2022. The Landlord’s
representative Faith McGregor, and the Tenant, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord is in
possession of an order terminating the tenancy for non-payment of rent. The Tenant testified there are now funds available as well as employment to void
that order and to pay the Landlord the rent in full and on time going forward.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s representative argues that the Tenant
had not paid rent on time for 12
months when the notice was served and has not paid on time for 17 months now.
 
3.    
Based on the submissions, I find that relief is appropriate. If indeed the Tenant can void
the current order, I find it is appropriate to provide the Tenant a chance to
pay on time and remain in this tenancy based on the conditions set out below.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord the lawful rent in full and on time for each consecutive month
commencing February 2022 and continuing through January 2023.
 
2.     In the event the Tenant fails to make the
above said payment in full and on time, the entire balance of the amount set
out in this Order will become due and payable forthwith under this Order. The Landlord shall be entitled to apply to
the Board, no later than 30 days after a breach of this Order, without notice
to the Tenant, for an Order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, pursuant
to Section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006.
