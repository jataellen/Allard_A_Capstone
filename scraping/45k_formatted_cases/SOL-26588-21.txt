In the matter of:      5, 379 BARTON STREET EAST

Between:                  Waterdown Investment Inc                                    Landlord
 
and
 




Christopher Barker Rebecca Seth


Tenants




 
On November 22, 2021, Waterdown
Investment Inc (the 'Landlord') applied in this L4 application for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Rebecca Seth and Christopher Barker (the
'Tenants') and for an order to have the
Tenants pay the rent they owe
because the Tenants failed to meet
a condition specified in the consent order issued by the Board on July 20, 2021
with respect to L1 application SOL-20933-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The previous consent order
provided that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants did not meet
certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenants have not met the following conditions specified in the order:
 
The Tenants failed
to pay to the Landlord
$190.00 on or before November
1, 2021 towards arrears of
rent. This was a breach of paragraph 3 of the consent order. This L4
application was filed within 30 days of the breach.
 
3.       
The previous L1 application included a request
for an order for the payment
of arrears of rent.
The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or
some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, in this L4
application the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenants agreed and were
ordered to pay $654.50 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in consent Order
SOL-20933-21. The Tenants only paid $570.00 so the amount
that is still owing from that order is $84.50, which is included in this order. As a result, the previous consent order
SOL-20933-21 is cancelled.
 
5.       
Since the date of the order,
the Tenants have also failed to
pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from November 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.




 
6.       
On December 1, 2019 the Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,350.00 from the
Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenants for the period from December 1, 2019
to January 11, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The previous consent order SOL-20933-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move
out of the rental unit on or before January
22, 2022 (standard 11 days from the
issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
If the Tenants made any payments
to the Landlord after this L4 application was filed, those
amounts shall be deducted from the calculations below.
 
4.       
As of November 30, 2021, the
Tenants owe no money to the Landlord because the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit
exceeds the arrears of rent up to November 30, 2021 by $543.55.
 
5.       
The Landlord is authorized to deduct from the credit of $543.55 owing to
the Tenants, the daily compensation rate of $45.36
per day for the use of the rental unit starting December 1, 2021 onwards until the earlier of when the credit runs out or when
the Tenants actually move out or get evicted.
 
6.       
The Landlord or the Tenants shall pay
to the other any sum of money that is owed as a
result of this order.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 22, 2022, then starting January
23, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after January 23, 2022.
 
 
 
January 11, 2022

The tenant has until January 21, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 21, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on July 23, 2022 if the order has not been
filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that
has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
