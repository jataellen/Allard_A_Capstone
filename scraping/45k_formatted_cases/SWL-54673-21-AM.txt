The order contained a clerical error, this amended
order was issued
to correct the order dated January 27, 2022. The
amendments are underlined for ease of reference. The Order was amended
to correct the surname of the Tenant “Jamie Labyash” to “Jamie Lebrash”.
 
2290017 Ontario Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jamie Lebrash and Richard Cleroux
(the 'Tenants') because
the Landlord intends
to demolish the rental unit. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard via video conference on January 10, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord’s Agent,
Jean Haidar and the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Richard Lammers, attended the hearing.
 
Prior to the commencement of
the hearing, the Landlord’s Legal Representative requested an amendment
to the L2 application due to a typographical error in the spelling of the Tenant
Jamie Labyash’s surname. The
Tenant’s correct surname is “Lebrash” and is recorded correctly in the N13 notice.
The amendment to the L2 application pertaining to the surname
of the Tenant Jamie Lebrash
was granted.
 
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.     The rental unit is a fully detached
house.




 
2.    
The Landlord served the Tenants
with an N13 notice to end your tenancy because the landlord wants to demolish
the rental unit, repair it or convert
it to another use (the ‘N13
notice’) on April 1, 2021. The N13
notice gave a termination date of July 31, 2021 and indicates that the Landlord
intends to demolish the rental unit.
 
3.     The Landlord’s Agent
testified that it has
provided one month’s rent in
compensation to the Tenants pursuant
to section 52(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’)
 
4.     At the hearing,
the Landlord’s Agent testified that it intended
to demolish the rental unit and build a double duplex residence
in its place.
 
5.     The Landlord’s Agent testified that they have retained
a company to complete the demolition, that architectural drawings have been supplied to the City of Windsor but the process cannot proceed further as the building needs to be
vacant.
 
6.    
The Landlord’s Agent testified that they have started the application process
with the City of Windsor to obtain permits related
to this project but the City of Windsor indicated they would not issue a
demolition permit until the residence is vacant. At the hearing, the Landlord
provided a copy of a receipt dated June 22, 2021 from the City of Windsor
detailing the receipt of a deposit fee
for a double duplex dwelling and also an information sheet setting out the process of obtaining a
demolition permit which details:
 
“before a demolition permit
is issued, the following steps must be done:
 
1.  
The building MUST be
VACANT”.
 
7.     While the Landlord
has yet to obtain a permit for demolition, section
50(1) of the Act does not require that the Landlord obtain such a permit
before the Board can issue an order terminating the tenancy:
 
50(1) A landlord may give notice
of termination of a tenancy
if the landlord requires
possession of the rental order in order to,
 
(a)  
demolish it;
 
(b)  
convert it to use for a purpose other than residential premises; or
 
(c)  
do repairs or renovations to it
that are so extensive that they require a building permit and vacant possession of the rental
unit. [Emphasis added]
 
 
8.     Based on the Landlord’s uncontested evidence, I am
satisfied that the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit to demolish
it and served the Tenants
with the N13 notice for this and no other improper purpose.
 
9.     The Landlord’s Agent testified that the Tenants have
been living in the rental unit for seven years, it is just the two of them living in the rental
unit, the Tenants
received notice




 
of the intended demolition in April, 2021 and
the Landlord is not aware
of any other considerations.
 
10.   I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
11.  This order contains
all of the reasons in this matter and no further reasons
will be issued.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated, as of February
28, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 28, 2022, then starting
March 1, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 1, 2022.
 
4.    
If the unit is not vacated on or
before February 28, 2022, the Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $19.46
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
March 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
