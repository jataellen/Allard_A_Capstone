Order under Section 68
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57288-21
 
 



In the matter of:


5,
  100 KING STREET HENSALL ON N0M1X0


 




Between:


Michelle Huang


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jen Lapointe


Tenant



 
 
 
Michelle Huang (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jen Lapointe (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for
each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard via video conference on February 17,
2022.
 
Only the Landlord’s legal
representative, Lisa Johnson,
attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The
Landlord’s application is based on two notices
that were served pursuant to section 64 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') (the “1st N5”) and pursuant to 68 of the
Act (the “2nd N5”). For the following reasons, I find that the notices
of termination are invalid and the Landlord’s application
must be dismissed.
 
2.    
The date of termination on the
Landlord’s 1st N5
is earlier than the 20th day after the notice
was served. Subsection 64(2)(a) specifies that an N5 notice of termination “shall provide
a termination date not earlier than the 20th day after the notice is given.”
 
3.     The
certificate of service
says that the 1st N5 was served in the mail on August
25, 2021. Rule 3.9 of the
Board’s Rules of Procedure sets out that “a document is considered
served on the fifth day after mailing”. This means that the 1st N5
is deemed to be served on August 30,
2021. The date of termination on the 1st N5 is September 17,
2021, which is earlier than the 20th day after
the notice was served,
contrary to subsection 64(2)(a) of the Act.

4.    
As the 1st N5 notice does not meet the mandatory requirements of the Act, it is invalid
and its contents cannot be considered.
 
5.    
The Landlord then served
a 2nd N5 notice of termination. However, as the first notice
was invalid, the Landlord lacked the authority under subsection 68(1) to
serve the second notice. As the first notice is invalid and the second notice
should not have been served, I find there is no basis for the Landlord’s application
and it must be dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
