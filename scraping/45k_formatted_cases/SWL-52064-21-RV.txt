Review Order
 
Richard Macdonald (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict Brett Walker (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved
by order SWL-52064-21 issued on August
19, 2021.
 
On September 17, 2021, the
Landlord requested a review of the order alleging they were not reasonably able to participate in the hearing because
they did not receive the Notice of Hearing.
 
The request was heard by way of
video conference on February 1, 2022. The Landlord and the Landlord’s Legal
Representative, Michael Radan attended the hearing. As of 9:31, the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
Landlord’s Request to Review
 
1.       
The Landlord’s Representative
submitted that the Landlord did not receive the Notice of Hearing and therefore
could not reasonably participate in the hearing that was held on August 12, 21. The Landlord’s Representative further submitted that the Landlord
has no intention of ever
abandoning the application and would have participated in the hearing had they
been given notice.
 
2.       
I
accept the Landlord’s uncontested evidence that they genuinely
wanted to participate in the hearing and had no intention of abandoning their
application. They did not attend
because they did not receive the Notice of Hearing. Having accepted the Landlord’s I am
satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Landlord was not reasonably
able to participate in the scheduled hearing of August 12, 2021.




 
 
 
3.       
The Landlord’s request to review is granted.
 
New Hearing of the Landlord’s L1 Application
 
 
4.       
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period from
March 1, 2021 to October 21, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective May 17, 2021.
 
5.       
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on October
21, 2021.

unit on the date the application was filed.
 
7.       
The lawful monthly rent was $1,800.00.
 
8.       
The Tenant made not payments to the Landlord

the Landlord.

11.    The amount the
Tenant owes the Landlord is $13,186.00 which is inclusive of arrears of rent and the cost of filing
the application. The last month rent
deposit, interest incurred on the last month’s rent deposit and daily compensation for the days the Tenant was not in possession of the rental unit for
October 22, 2021 to October 31, 2021 will be deducted.
