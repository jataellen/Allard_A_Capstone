Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-21497-19
 











 
 
 

AP I LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict DH (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on January 23,
2020.
 
The Landlord’s legal
representative, JA, and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
It is determined that:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid
$3,286.73 of the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
August 1, 2019 to January 31, 2020. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination.
 
2.     
The Tenant also owes the
Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     
The total amount owing is
$3,461.73 ($3,286.73 + $175.00).
 
4.      The Landlord is seeking a termination order with
a voiding date of February 29, 2020.  The Landlord’s legal representative
submits that this would give the Tenant a bit more time to pay off all the
arrears.
 
5.      The Tenant is seeking a payment plan.  He said
that he lives with his daughter, (RH), and that she normally pays half the rent
and he pays half the rent.
 
6.      The Tenant said that he works at a courier
companyr, earning about $2,000.00 per month.  He said that he also has
significant expenses of about $500.00 per month for a previously stolen
vehicle.  The Tenant said that his daughter was sick and spent time in
hospital, and she lost shifts at work.  Consequently, he said that his daughter
failed to pay her half of the rent for a number of months.
 
7.      The Tenant said that he had a number of
arguments with his daughter about rent and expenses, and he fell behind in
paying other bills.
 
8.      RH testified, and she said that she was diagnosed
with epileptic seizures, and she took four months off of work.  She said that
she returned to work on January 13, 2020, and earns about $600.00 per week. 
She also said that she has had a number of arguments about the rent with her
father.
 
9.      The Tenant proposes paying the full rent, on
time, going forward, as well as paying $500.00 per month towards the arrears. 
He said that he recently got a promotion, and that he will have an almost 25%
increase in his income.
 
10.   The Landlord’s record of the Tenant’s payments
indicate that there were payments towards the rent almost every month, but that
the Tenant did not have enough money to pay the full rent.  This corroborates
RH’s testimony.  RH said that she is now working and earning enough to pay her
half of the rent.  
 
11.   Consequently, I find that the Tenant should be
given an opportunity to preserve his tenancy by meeting the terms of his
payment plan.
 
12.   I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances mentioned above, in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to the conditions set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
 
On consent, it is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Tenant shall pay the
Landlord $3,461.73 arrears and costs as
follows:                                                      
 
a)   
$500.00 on or before
February 29, 2020,
b)   
Payments of $500.00 on or
before the 30th of each of the following months: March, April, May,
June and July, 2020,
c)   
$461.73 on or before August
30, 2020.
 
2.     
The Tenant shall also pay
the Landlord rent owing for the month of February, 2020, on or before February
29, 2020; as well as and rent owing for the months of March, April, May, June,
July, and August, 2020, no later than the first business day of each of those
months, respectively.
 
3.     
If the Tenant fails to make
any one of the payments in accordance with this order, the outstanding balance
of any arrears of rent and costs to be paid by the Tenant to the Landlord
pursuant to paragraph 1 of this order shall become immediately due and owing
and the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant apply to the Board pursuant
to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenant and requiring that the Tenant pay any new arrears, NSF fees and related
charges that became owing after January 31, 2020.  The Landlord must make the
application no later than 30 days after the Tenant fails to make a payment.
