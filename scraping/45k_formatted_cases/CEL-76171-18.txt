In the matter of:


 


 




 


 


 




Between:


S S  (‘SS’)


Landlord




 


 


 




 


and


 




 


 


 




 


A O  (‘AO’)
B N  (‘BN’)


Tenants




 


 
 


 



 
S S (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict B N and A O (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe.  (L1 Application)
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenants because they, another occupant of the rental
unit or a person the Tenants permitted in the residential complex have
seriously impaired the safety of any person.  (L2 Application)
 
The Tenants applied for an order determining that the
Landlord or the Landlord's superintendent or agent harassed,
obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with them and substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential
complex by the Tenants or by a member of their household.  (T2 Application)
 
These applications were heard in Mississauga on July
31, 2018.   
 
The Landlord and the Landlord’s
Legal Representative, J H (‘JH’), attended the hearing.  Dr. A S (‘DAS’) signed
the attendance sheet, stating he is a co-owner of the rental unit, but
indicated he was in attendance simply in quiet support of SS.  
 
I called these applications
forward initially at 10:00 am, and commenced to hear the applications on an
uncontested basis.  JH submitted an L1 Update Sheet and examined SS in respect
of both the L1 and L2 applications, submitting six exhibits into evidence in
support of the SS’ testimony.  Near the end of SS’ examination, at
approximately 10:35 am, the Tenant, BN, arrived for the hearing and I stopped
the proceedings to allow her to participate.  I held down the hearing and asked
the parties to exchange evidence/documents that they were going to rely upon at
the hearing.  
 
The parties left the hearing room
so that they could attempt mediation, but returned shortly thereafter when
their attempt at mediation failed.  I re-called the matter forward later in the
hearing block.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 Application
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent they were required to pay for the period from May 1, 2018 to
July 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective May 22, 2018.
2.     
BN contested the Landlord’s
claim that rent for May 2018 was not paid.  BN testified that she did not pay
May 2018 rent herself, but was under the impression that AO had paid May 2018
rent.  BN testified that AO was recently incarcerated so she was unable to
secure any evidence or statement from AO about May 2018 rent.  
3.     
BN explained her personal
circumstances relating to her competing obligations for her three children and
her mother, who is undergoing a nursing home placement in Owen Sound.  In sum,
BN was unable to produce anything tangible to indicate that rent for May 2018
had indeed been paid.  SS reaffirmed for the record that May 2018 was not paid,
as had been indicated in the N4 notice and the L1 application.
4.     
The parties did not dispute
that since the filing of the L1 application on May 23, 2018, the Tenants have
made no payments to the Landlord.
5.     
Based on the submissions of
the parties, I find on a balance of probabilities that the rent arrears as
declared in the N4 notice and the L1 application are an accurate accounting of
rents owed by the Tenants to the Landlord.  More specifically, I find that
under the L1 application as it stands, the Tenants owe the Landlords $4,060.00,
which represents the rent arrears up to and including July 31, 2018 and
includes the cost of filing the application.
6.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,290.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
7.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from December 12, 2017 to May 22, 2018.
8.     
Once I made my determination
regarding the rent arrears (paragraph 5 above), the parties both indicated a
mutual desire to terminate the tenancy in a final (non-remedial) way.  The
parties were about two to four weeks apart in their requests for a termination
date.  I heard submissions from both parties regarding their circumstances and their
perceived prejudices for shortening or lengthening the termination date.  
9.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until August 31, 2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of
the Act.
10.  
I gave my determination
regarding the August 31, 2018 termination date to the parties present.  From
that, the parties were able to reach a mutual agreement about how the rent
arrears and filing fee are to be paid back to the Landlord.  Specifically, the
parties agreed that the total amount owing would be paid in $100.00 increments
on the 22nd day of each month starting on September 22, 2018 until
the total amount owing is paid off.  If the Tenants miss any one of the monthly
payments, then the total balance owing at that point of the missed payment
would be due to the Landlords in full.  Finally, they agreed that the last
month’s rent deposit that the Landlord is holding will be applied against the
rent due for August 2018.
L2 Application
11.  
Before me, the parties
requested an order on consent to resolve the L2 application for the remainder
of the tenancy.  Specifically, the Tenants agreed not to smoke, neither in the
rental unit nor on the rental unit property for the duration of the tenancy,
subject to a section 78 provision under the Act.
T2 Application
12.  
 The Tenants requested a
withdrawal of their T2 application.  Pursuant to subsection 200(4) of the Act,
I consented to the withdrawal of the application.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenants is terminated in a final way (cannot be remedied) as
of August 31, 2018.
2.     
The Tenants must move out of
the rental unit on or before August 31, 2018.
3.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before August 31, 2018, then starting September 1, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
4.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after September 1, 2018.
5.     
The last month’s rent deposit
currently held by the Landlord shall be applied against the last monthly rental
period of August 1-31, 2018.
6.     
The Tenants shall pay the
Landlord $4,060.00, which represents the rent owing up to and including July
31, 2018 and includes the application filing fee.  The Tenants shall pay the
$4,060.00 according to the following schedule:
a)    39 monthly payments, each being $100.00 on or before the twenty-second
(22nd) day of every month, starting on September 22, 2018 up to and
including November 22, 2021; and 
b)    a final 40th payment of $160.00 on or before December 22,
2021.
7.     
If the Tenants fail to make
any one of the payments in paragraph 6 of this order, in full and on time, the
full balance owing becomes due and payable immediately and the Tenants will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from the date
of the missed payment at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding
8.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before August 31, 2018, the Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$42.41* per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting September 1,
2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
9.     
For the remainder of the
tenancy, the Tenants shall not smoke any cigarettes or any other tobacco
related products inside the rental unit, neither will they smoke outside the
rental unit while on the property of the Landlord.
10.  
If the Tenants fail to
comply with any part of paragraph 9 of this order, the Landlord may apply under
section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, without notice to the
Tenants for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants.  The
Landlord must make this application no later than 30 days after the Tenants’
failure to comply.
11.  
The Tenants’ T2 application
is withdrawn.
