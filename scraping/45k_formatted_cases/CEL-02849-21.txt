Rohan Sujeevan George


Tenant



 
 
 
Jagdeep Singh Sandhu and Kawaljeet Sandhu (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Rohan Sujeevan George
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on January 10, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Samila Waslat attended the hearing. As of 10:30 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period
from September 1, 2020 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords
served a Notice of Termination
effective September 16, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on January 8, 2022. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     
The lawful monthly rent was $1,500.00.
 
4.     
The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.     
The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,970.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2020 to September 16, 2021.




File Number: CEL-02849-21
