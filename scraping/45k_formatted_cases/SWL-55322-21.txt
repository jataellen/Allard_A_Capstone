Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006

In the matter
of:


UNIT 1, 7 THIRD STREET CHATHAM-KENT ON N7M2M4


 




Between:


Nadak Properties Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Cheryl Caron


Tenant



 
 
 
Nadak Properties Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Cheryl Caron (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or a person the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex has seriously impaired the safety of any
person.
 
This
application was heard via videoconference on January 24, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s legal agent, N. Owen (NO), the Landlord’s property manager, J.
Austin (JA), and the Landlord’s legal representative, M. Stover, attended the
hearing. As of 11:43 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     For the reasons that follow, I find that the Tenant seriously
impaired the safety of any person. I also find it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction.
 
2.    
The N7 Notice of Termination was
served on the Tenant on September 27, 2021. The N7 alleges that on September
22, 2021, the Tenant set fire to the kitchen floor of her rental unit and was
arrested for arson.
 
3.     NO testified that she attended
the unit on the day of the fire. She entered the unit and saw
burn marks, ashes on the floor and burnt paper materials on the kitchen floor.
Submitted into evidence were photographs of same.
JA testified having attended the unit and having
been told by the Tenant’s father and the fire department that the Tenant
intentionally set fire in the unit. The Tenant was subsequently charged with
arson.
 
4.     Pursuant to section
66 of the Act, a landlord may give a tenant a notice of termination if an
act or omission of the tenant seriously impairs the safety of another person, provided that the act or omission
complained of occurs in the residential complex.




 
5.    
In order to be successful on this ground,
the Landlord must establish that the
effect of the Tenant’s actions threatens the wellbeing or physical integrity of
another person to such a degree that termination of the tenancy
is reasonable in order to ensure the safety of others.
 
6.     Based on the evidence before me, I am satisfied, on a
balance of probabilities, that the Tenant engaged in the conduct as detailed in
the N7 notice of termination and, as such, has seriously impaired the safety of another person in the
residential complex. I base this on JA’s uncontested evidence
that the Tenant started the fire.
Further, the Tenant’s arson
charge is persuasive that she had caused the fire. Intentionally starting fires
in the rental unit poses a serious risk to the safety of the other occupants in
the residential complex.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
8.     JA testified that on October 16, 2021, the Tenant
caused another fire in the living room of the
rental unit. Submitted
into evidence were photographs of this incident.
The fire fighters that attended the unit informed JA that the Tenant caused
the fire. The Tenant was charged
with arson.
 
9.     In consideration of the foregoing, and the fact that the Tenant did not attend
the hearing to disclose her circumstances for me to
consider delaying or denying eviction, I find relief should not be granted.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
February 21, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 21, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing this application.
 
3.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing on or before February 21, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit
is not vacated on or before February
21, 2022, then starting February 22, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
5.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed to give vacant
possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 22, 2022. The
Sheriff is requested to expedite the enforcement of this order.
