In the matter
of:


186 LACROIX STREET CHATHAM ON N7M2V4


 




Between:


Chatham Hope
Non Profit Housing


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Veronica Rhoeler


Tenant



 
 
 
Chatham Hope Non Profit Housing
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Veronica Rhoeler (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after
the termination date.
 
This application was heard via video conference on January 17, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative Robert
Rose and the Landlord’s Representative Kim Teeter attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant persistently failed to
pay rent when it was due.
 
2.     The Tenant is to pay rent to the Landlord
on the first of the month and the tenancy
is month to month.
 
3.    
The Landlord testified that the Tenant
has persistently failed
to pay the lawful rent on the date
it was due; at the time of service of the N8 notice, the rent has been paid late
ten of the past 12 months. Since the service of the N8 notice, the
Tenant has started to pay rent on time.
 
4.     Section 58 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006,
(the ‘Act’) sets out that a landlord
may give a tenant notice of termination of their tenancy if the tenant
has persistently failed to pay rent on the date it becomes due and payable (N8
notice). The Landlord served the
Tenants with a N8 notice on May 13, 2021 that is effective July 31, 2021. I accept the uncontested testimony and
evidence of the Landlord and am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the Tenant
has persistently failed
to pay the rent on the date it was due.

Section 83 considerations
 
5.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. The Landlord’s uncontested evidence established that the Tenant
persistently paid late however, the Tenant has begun to pay rent on time as at
the service of the N8 notice. I find that a pay-on-time order is appropriate in
these circumstances. As termination
is a remedy of last resort, I find the Tenant should be given another
opportunity with a pay-on-time order.
 
6.     The Landlord has incurred the cost of $201.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay
to the Landlord the full rent owing on or before
the first day of each month, commencing March 1, 2022 and
for 12 months thereafter up to and including March 1, 2023.
 
2.    
If the Tenant fails to comply
with the conditions set out in paragraph 1 above, then, within
30 days of the breach, the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenant.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing
this application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing on or before August 1, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from August
2, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
