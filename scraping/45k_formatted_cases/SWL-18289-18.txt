Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: SWL-18289-18
 











 
 
 

RP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict TD (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Windsor on
September 5, 2018.
 
TG, the Landlord’s
Agent, attended the hearing.  The Tenant attended the hearing and spoke with
Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from May 1, 2018 to
September 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective June 18, 2018.
 
2.      The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
 
3.      The monthly rent is $900.00.
 
4.      The Landlord is not holding a last month's rent deposit. 
 
5.     
The Tenant paid $900.00
after the application was filed.
 
6.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.  The Tenant has had an
interruption in her social assistance and then was involved in a motor vehicle
collision which interfered with her ability to consult with her worker to
arrange to be re-instated.  As a result, she has only paid rent one month in the
last 5.  She did not look for alternate housing because she spoke with the
Landlord early in August and understood from that discussion that the Landlord
would be willing to negotiate a payment plan.  The Landlord’s Legal
Representative was unwilling to negotiate a payment plan because the parties
had previously entered into a mediated agreement with respect to arrears and as
soon as the mediated agreement was satisfied the Tenant stopped paying her
rent.  I am satisfied that it would not be unfair to the Landlord to give the
Tenant some time to find alternate accommodation based on the Tenant’s promise
to pay $900.00 on each of September 7, and September 20 and October 1, 2018,
and to leave October 31, 2018.  The Tenant agreed at the hearing that the first
payment due on September 7, 2018, would have to be paid before she would
receive the order. 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before October 31, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $3,775.00 which represents the rent owing up to September 30, 2018, and
the cost of filing the application.  The Tenant shall also pay the Landlord
$900.00 for the rent for the month of October 31, 2018.
3.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing on or before October 31, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from November
1, 2018, at 3.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
4.     
The Landlord’s application
to evict the Tenants on an earlier date is denied on the condition that:
(a)  The Tenants shall make the following payments to the
Landlord in respect of the monies owing under paragraph 2 of this order:



Date Payment Due


Amount of Payment




September 7, 2018


$900.00
(arrears and costs)




September 20, 2018


$900.00
(arrears)



 
(b)  The Tenants shall also pay the Landlord the rent
for the month of October 2018. 
5.      If the Tenants fail to make the payments in
accordance with paragraph 4, and by the dates required, then:
(a)  The Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenants on an earlier date than October 31, 2018, and for the payment of any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not
already ordered under paragraph 2 of this order. The
Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a breach of a condition
set out in paragraph 3 or 4 of this order. If the Landlord obtains an order under
section 78 of the Act, then the Landlord may choose which eviction order to
enforce. 
(b)  The balance owing under paragraph 2 of this order shall become payable on the day following the date of
default. The monies owing shall bear interest at the post-judgment interest
rate determined under subsection 207(7) of the Act.
6.     
Notwithstanding paragraphs 4
and 5 of this order, if the unit is not vacated on or before October 31, 2018,
then starting November 1, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced. 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after November 1, 2018.
