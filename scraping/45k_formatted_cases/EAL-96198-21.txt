The Estate

Christine Thompson


Tenant
 
 
Subtenant



 
 
1035409 Ontario Ltd (the
'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Christine Thompson
(the ‘Subtenant’) because
the subtenancy ended but the subtenant failed
to move out of the rental unit.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 24, 2021 at 3:16pm.
 
The Landlord’s agent, Bill Tai, and the Subtenant attended the hearing.
The Landlord was represented by James Moak. The
Subtenant was represented by Brittany Di Trani.
 
Also in attendance was the Landlord’s witness, Loretta Wong.
 
Determinations:
 
PRELIMINARY ISSUE:
IS CT A SUBTENANT?
 
1.     The Landlord’s A2 application was filed pursuant
to subsection 101(1)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 which states:
 
101 (1) If a subtenant continues
to occupy a rental unit after the end of the subtenancy, the landlord or the tenant
may apply to the Board
for an order evicting the
subtenant.
 
2.     The Landlord’s agent, Bill Tai, who is an employee of
the Landlord for the past eleven years, testified that he had personal knowledge of the Tenant’s
tenancy which began in
2013. At that time, the Tenant had a roommate named Kyle. After that, he had a
roommate named Kim Porter who moved in, in 2015 and moved out in August 2016.




 
3.    
BT testified that the named
Subtenant moved into the rental unit at some point in September or October
2016; between then and January 14, 2021, when the Tenant passed away, there was no request
received by the Landlord to add the Subtenant to the
lease agreement as a Tenant. The Tenant always paid the rent and occupied the
rental unit at all times during this period.
 
4.     Section 2(1) of the Act defines a subtenant as means the person to whom a tenant gives the right under section 97 to occupy
a rental unit. Subsection 2(2) states:
 
(2)    
For the purposes of this
Act, a reference to subletting a rental unit refers to the
situation in which,
 
(a)   the tenant vacates the rental unit;
 
(b)  
the tenant gives one or more other persons
the right to occupy the rental unit for a term ending on a
specified date before the end of the tenant’s term or period; and
 
(c)  
the tenant has the right to resume occupancy of the rental
unit after that specified date.
 
[Emphasis added.]
 
5.     Based on the evidence before the Board, I do not find
that Christine Thompson, the named subtenant, falls within the definition of a
subtenant; I say this because the Landlord’s own evidence indicates that at no
point during the period in which CT occupied
the rental unit, did the Tenant vacate the rental
unit. The Landlord’s application pursuant to subsection 101(1) must be dismissed.
 
REQUEST TO AMEND
 
6.     The Landlord’s representative sought to amend the
application to include Reason 1 (an application under subsection 100(1) of the
Act); he submitted that the application was filed by the Landlord’s agent and that he was only retained
a week ago. The amendment was not sought earlier as he
just noticed the issue today.
 
7.     The Tenant’s representative opposed the amendment
request as it would provide the Landlord with an unfair advantage of being within
the 60-day requirement. I reserved on this issue to hear the merits of the
application.
 
8.     My determination on the issue below renders
this request moot as, even if the Landlord’s
request to amend is granted, the Landlord is out of time in filing this
application.
 
APPLICATION FILED AFTER 60 DAYS
 
9.     Towards the end of the hearing, the issue of the
application not being filed within time arose. The Landlord testified that it
came to the Landlord’s attention that the named subtenant was still living
in the rental unit after the Tenant
passed away on January 14, 2021, when the Tenant’s daughter
contacted the Landlord to inform him of this.




 
10.  Pursuant to subsection 91(1) of the Act, if a tenant of a rental unit dies and there are no
other tenants of the rental unit, the tenancy shall be deemed to be terminated
30 days after the death of the tenant.
 
11.  In this case, if what the Landlord is saying is true
and without making any determinations on CT’s status
as the common-law partner of the Tenant,
the tenancy ended on February 13, 2021. The Landlord had
between February 14 and April 15, 2021 to file the application. The Board’s
records show the Landlord’s application was filed on April 16, 2021 and payment
was received on June 25, 2021.
 
12.  Subsection 100(2) of the Act states:
 
100(2) An application under
subsection (1) must
be made no later than 60 days after the landlord discovers the
unauthorized occupancy.
 
[Emphasis added.]
 
13.  Based on the above, the Landlord’s A2 application must be dismissed
as it was not filed within 60 days.
 
14.  This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlords' application is dismissed.
