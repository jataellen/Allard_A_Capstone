In the matter
of:


20, 72 WILLIAM STREET GUELPH ON N1E5E6


 




Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Sara Royer


Tenant



 
 
 
Williams & McDaniel Property Management (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sara Royer
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 14, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, John Anderson, attended the hearing. As of 10:37 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from August 1,
2021 to December 31, 2021. Because of
the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 1,
2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The monthly
rent is $1,207.19.
 
4.    
The Tenant
paid $5,435.38 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,999.28 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
The only amounts outstanding are $1.67 in rent arrears
and the Landlord's cost of $186.00 in filing the application. As a result, the order will be limited
these amounts only and not eviction.
