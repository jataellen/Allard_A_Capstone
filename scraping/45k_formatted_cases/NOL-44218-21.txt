In the
  matter of:


1040 Whalen Lane
SERPENT RIVER ON P0P1V0


 




Between:


Cynthia Grise


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jodie Crotty Roger
Gaudreau


Tenants



 
 
 
Cynthia Grise (the 'Landlord') applied for an order requiring
Roger Gaudreau and Jodie Crotty (the 'Tenants') to pay the rent
that they owe.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 20, 2022.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant, Jodie Crotty, attended
the hearing. Jodie Crotty was representing
both Tenants at the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord submitted an application to the Board because the Tenants did not pay the
total rent they were required to pay for the period
from May 1, 2021 to October 15, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants were in possession of the rental
unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $804.00.
 
4.     The Landlord sold the rental unit in October 15, 2021
and is entitled to collect the rent owing during the time she owned the property as well as the $201.00
for the cost of the filing the application.
 
5.     The Tenants did not pay any rent from May 1, 2021 to October
31, 2021. This was
confirmed by the Tenant during the hearing.
 
6.     At the hearing, the Tenant did not provide sufficient
grounds for not paying any rent during the period of this application, therefore, I find that the Tenants
are responsible for the outstanding rental arrears.
