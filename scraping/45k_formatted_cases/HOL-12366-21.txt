Rachel Devenport (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Fancis (Frank) Dalcourt (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 1, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord and the Landlord's Legal Representative, Al Martin, attended
the hearing. As of
2:55 p.m. the Tenant was not present or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the
Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 16, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on January
31, 2022. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
3.    
The lawful monthly rent was $1,500.00.
4.    
The Tenant paid $2,500.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,500.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of January
31, 2022, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,645.88*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 31, 2022, less the rent deposit.

$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.

the full amount owing* on or before
February 27, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 28, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
