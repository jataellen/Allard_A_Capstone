Order
under Section 69 & 77
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: SWL-12285-18
 











 
 
 

SB and 1600828 Ontario Inc (the
'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict RE (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Sarnia on
March 21, 2018.
 
SB attended the hearing on behalf of both
Landlords.  The Tenant attended the hearing and declined the opportunity to speak
with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent he was required to pay for the period from August 1, 2017 to March
31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination
effective January 4, 2018.
 
2.      The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
 
3.      The monthly rent is $600.00.
 
4.      The Landlord is not holding a last month's rent deposit. 
 
5.      The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed. 
 
6.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.  The Tenant agreed that
he owes the arrears and was looking for new premises.  He asked for some time
to vacate.  His request for termination May 31, 2018, would be unfair to the
Landlord because the arrears are significant.  However, I am not satisfied that
it would be unfair to the Landlord to give the Tenant until April 30, 2018, to
find alternate accommodation on condition that the Tenant pays $600.00 on or
before Monday, March 26, 2018, and pays the rent for April on April 1, 2018. 
The Tenant was adamant that he was about to receive funds that would allow him
to make those payments.  In reaching this decision I have considered the fact
that the Tenant has a brain injury of which the Landlord must have been aware
and the Landlord failed to provide the Tenant with receipts for rental
payments.  
It is ordered that:
                                          
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before April 30, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $4,999.00, which represents the rent owing up to March 31, 2018, and
the cost of filing the application. 
3.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing on or before April 30, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from May 1,
2018, at 3.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
4.     
The Landlord’s application
to evict the Tenants on an earlier date than April 30, 2018, is denied on the
condition that:
(a)  The Tenant shall make the following payments to the
Landlord in respect of the monies owing under paragraph 2 of this order:



Date Payment Due


Amount of Payment




March 26, 2018 


$600.00
(arrears and costs)



 
(b)  The Tenant shall also pay the Landlord the rent
for the month of April 2018 on April 1, 2018.
5.      If the Tenant fails to make the payments in
accordance with paragraph 4, and by the dates required, then:
(a)  The Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenant on an earlier date than April 30, 2018, and for the payment of any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not
already ordered under paragraph 2 of this order. The
Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a breach of a condition
set out in paragraph 4 of this order. If the Landlord obtains an order under
section 78 of the Act, then the Landlord may choose which eviction order to
enforce. 
(b)  The balance owing under paragraph 2 of this
order shall become payable on the day following the date of default. The monies
owing shall bear interest at the post-judgment interest rate determined under
subsection 207(7) of the Act.
6.     
Notwithstanding paragraphs 4
and 5 of this order, if the unit is not vacated on or before April 30, 2018,
than starting May 1, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced. 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord, on or after May 1, 2018.
