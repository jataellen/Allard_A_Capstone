Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: SOL-24817-21



In the matter
of:


310, 120 KING STREET W STONEY CREEK ON L8G1J2


 




Between:


1810915 Ontario Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Alyssa
Moore


Tenant



 
 
1810915 Ontario
Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Alyssa Moore (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The
Landlord also claimed administration charges related to NSF cheques.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on January 11, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Agents, Rita Pugliese and Thomas Trombetta, attended the hearing.
As of 11:08 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord
filed 3 N4 notices with their application.
 
2.    
The first notice was served (according to the certificate of service) on July 2, 2021 listed a
termination date of July 15, 2021. The second notice was served on August 2,
2021 and listed a termination date of August 15, 2021. The third notice was
served on September 2, 2021 and listed a termination date of September 15,
2021.
 
3.    
All three
notices share the same fatal flaw in that they have only provided the Tenant with thirteen (13) days to correct the
notice not fourteen (14) as is required.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord's application is dismissed.
