Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55641-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


D, 50 STIRLING AVENUE S KITCHENER
  ON N2G3N9


 




Between:


Robert De
  Pasquale


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Tara Van Horne


Tenant



 
 
Robert De Pasquale (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Tara Van Horne (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 20, 2022. As of 1:53 p.m., the Tenant
was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board. The Landlord attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from October 1, 2020 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 17, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.      The lawful monthly
rent is $600.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant paid $1,200.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 20, 2022.




File Number: SWL-55641-21
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,834.26*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 9, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$19.45 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 10, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 20, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 21, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 20, 2022, then starting February
21, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 21, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
February 20, 2022,
the Tenant pays the amount of $6,461.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit. If this payment is not made
in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act
to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection
on or after February 21, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period
of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 

February 9, 2022 Date Issued
 
South West-RO, 150 Dufferin
Avenue, Suite 400, 4th Floor London ON

In accordance with section 81 of

Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
