Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-99222-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


18, 28 CLIFF
CRESCENT KINGSTON ON K7M1A8


 




Between:


Kingston Frontenac Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Timothy Lemmon


Tenant



 
 
 
Kingston Frontenac Housing
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Timothy Lemmon (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the
rent the Tenant owes because
the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified in the order
issued by the Board on August 10, 2021 with respect to application
EAL-95183-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order: the Tenant
did not pay $442.88 on or before December 20, 2021, nor did they pay the lawful
rent for January in full on or before January 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears
of rent. Accordingly, in
addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for
the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $3,986.00 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order EAL-95183-21. The amount that is still owing from that
order is $1,586.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order EAL-95183-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of
the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from December 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.




File Number: EAL-99222-22
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The previous order EAL-95183-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 7, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$3,649.85*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 27, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $39.45
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 28, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
7, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 8, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 7, 2022, then starting
February 8, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 8, 2022.
January 27, 2022                                                                            Date Issued                                                                      Kathleen Wells

The tenant has until February 7, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by February
7, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.
 
In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on August 8, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before
this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
