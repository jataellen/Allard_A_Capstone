In the matter of:      A, 3 EAST 37TH STREET
HAMILTON ON L8V4A7

Kim Forrest Roy Burtwell


Tenants




 
 
 
On January 11, 2022,
Interrent c/o CLV Group (the 'Landlord') applied in this L4 application for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Kim Forrest and Roy Burtwell (the 'Tenants') and for an
order to have the Tenants pay the damage they owe because the Tenants failed to
meet a condition specified in the consent order issued by the Board on January
4, 2022 with respect to L2 application SOL-24346-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The previous consent order
provided that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants did not meet
certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I find that the Tenants have not
met the following condition specified in the order: On January 9, 2022
the Tenant Roy Burtwell was seen on security cameran making an inappropriate
gesture with his middle finger. On
January 11, 2022 at approximately 8:30 am the Tenant Roy Burtwell was standing
in a doorway at the residential complex and gave the “finger”
to an employee. On January
11, 2022 the Tenant Ms. Kim Forrest was exiting a unit in the
building and sneered “bitch” toward an employee of the Landlord. These were breaches of paragraph 2 of the
consent order. This L4 application
was filed within 30 days of the breaches mentioned above.
 
3.       
The previous consent order also ordered
damages associated with security cameras
to be repaid by the Tenants on or before January 31, 2022.
 
4.       
The previous consent order SOL-24346-21 is cancelled.




 
5.       
On August 31, 2017 the Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $533.95 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being
held by the Landlord.
 
6.       
Interest on the rent deposit was
last paid out to the Tenants up to the period ending December 31, 2020. Interest
is owing on the deposit
for the period from January
1, 2021 to January 21, 2022
(note: 2021 there was no guideline rent increase allowed and consequently no
interest on deposit due to COVID19).
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The previous consent order SOL-24346-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move
out of the rental
unit on or before
February 1, 2022 (standard 11 days from the issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
Since the previous consent
order SOL-24326-21 was cancelled, the conditions at paragraphs 1 and 4 of that order shall
be re-ordered in this order:
 
(a)  
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $431.66
on or before January 31, 2022,
which represents the damages associated with the security camera.
 
(b)  
If the Tenants fail to make the
payment of $431.66 by January
31, 2022, then the balance owing shall become
payable on the day following the date of default. The monies owing
shall bear interest
at the post-judgment interest rate determined under subsection 207(7) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006.
 
4.       
As of the date of this order, the
Tenants owe no money to the Landlord because the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit
leaves a credit owing to the
Tenants of $534.32.
 
5.       
Since the Tenants will owe daily
compensation of $18.04 per day starting January 22, 2022 (the day after this
order is issued) until they actually move out of the rental unit or get
evicted, and since it is unknown at this time when the vacate date will be, the
Landlord is authorized to offset
the daily compensation rate and the damages of $431.66
(if the damages are not paid by the due date of January 31, 2022) from the
credit of
$534.32 currently
owing to the Tenants, until the credit
runs out.
 
6.       
The Landlord or the Tenants shall pay
to the other any sum of money that is owed as a
result of this order.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 1, 2022, then starting February
2, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.




 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 2, 2022.
 
 
January 21, 2022

The tenant has until January 31, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 31, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on August
2, 2022 if the order has not been filed
on or before this date with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the
rental unit is located.
