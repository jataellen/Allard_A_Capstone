Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-98820-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


901, 295 ADELAIDE STREET WEST TORONTO
  ON M5V0L4


 




Between:


Amanda Waichenberg


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kendall Andjelkovic


Tenant



 
 
 
On November 12, 2021, Amanda Waichenberg (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kendall
Andjelkovic (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant entered into an agreement to
terminate the tenancy.
 
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord and the Tenant signed an agreement to terminate the tenancy as of
November 30, 2022.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before November 30, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before November 30,
2022, then starting December 1, 2022, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.




File Number: EAL-98820-21
 
 
 
 
3.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after December 1, 2022.

The tenant has until January 21, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order
under s. 77(6) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 21, 2022 the order will be
stayed and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on June 1, 2023 if
the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
