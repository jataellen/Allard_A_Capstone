Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-04402-22
 
 



In the
  matter of:


50, 3895
DOUG LEAVENS BLVD MISSISSAUGA ON L5N7G1


 




Between:


Nixon Blake


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jarvis George


Tenant



 
 
Nixon Blake (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jarvis
George (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant gave a notice to terminate the
tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    The Landlord filed an L3 application on December 24, 2021 which notes a termination date of December 15, 2021.
 
2.    The Landlord submitted
a declaration which noted that the Tenant
vacated the rental unit
on December 15, 2021.
 
3.    The Landlord’s declaration also noted that the parties
entered into a lease agreement commencing January 15, 2021, with a one-year
term ending January 14, 2021. I
believe that there was a clerical
error and the end date of the lease was intended to read January 14, 2022 not 2021.
 
4.    As the tenancy has already terminated and the terms of
the lease have ended, the Landlord’s application seeking
termination of tenancy
is moot and therefore will not be considered.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
 
January 19, 2022
