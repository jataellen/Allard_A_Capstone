Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-11388-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


N/A, 109 RYLAND
STREET S NEPEAN ON K2J6R1


 




Between:


Caroline Risi


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Hasam Asha Nancy Lalonde


Tenants



 
 
 
Caroline Risi (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Nancy Lalonde and Hasam Asha (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 23, 2021.
Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from November 1, 2020 to November
30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 1, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
paid $4,200.00 after the application was filed.
 
3.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), including the impact of the pandemic and whether the Landlord
attempted to negotiate a payment plan, and find that it would be unfair to
grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 25, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$18,825.66*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 14, 2022.




File Number: HOL-11388-21
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $96.99
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 15, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
25, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 26,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 25, 2022, then starting January
26, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 26, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 25, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $20,514.33** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after January
26, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once
during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
