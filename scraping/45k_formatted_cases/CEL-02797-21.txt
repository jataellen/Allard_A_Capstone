Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-02797-21
 
 



In the matter of:


BASEMENT, 95 CURTIS DRIVE
(BASEMENT) DRIVE
BRAMPTON ON L6Y2J6


 




Between:


Joaquim Alexandre


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Christina Marocco


Tenants



 
 
 
 
Joaquim Alexandre
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Cassandra Bekiaris, Nickolas
Bekiaris and Christina Marocco
(the 'Tenants') because the Landlord requires possession of the
rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard via video conference on January 20,
2022.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s daughter, Elizabeth Alexandre, the Tenant and the Tenant’s
legal representative, Jeff Rodriguez, attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
Preliminary Issue
 
1.    
At the hearing, the parties agreed
to remove two of the named Tenants
from the application as they
are both 18 years old or under.
 
The Landlord’s Application
 
2.    
For the following reasons,
I find that the Landlord’s application must be dismissed.
 
3.    
The Landlord served a notice of
termination pursuant to subsection 48(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'). The date of termination on the notice
is November 1, 2021.
 
4.    
Subsection 48(2) of the Act says, “the date for termination specified in the notice shall be
at least 60 days after the notice is given and shall be the day a period of the
tenancy ends or, where the tenancy is for a fixed term, the end of the term.”
This section means




File Number: CEL-02797-21
 
that,
if the rent is due on the first day of the month, the date of termination must be the last day of the month.
 
5.    
There is no dispute
that the term of the original ease agreement has ended and the Tenant is now on a month-to-month tenancy. There is also no dispute that the monthly rent is due on or before the
first day of every month.
 
6.    
As the monthly rent is due on or before the first
of the month, and the date of termination on the notice is November
1, 2021, and not the last day of the month, the notice fails to comply with the mandatory
requirements of the Act. As the notice fails to comply with the
mandatory requirements of the Act, it is invalid and the Landlord’s application
must be dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
