Order under Section
31
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWT-45853-20
 
 



In the
  matter of:


153 SYDENHAM STREET LONDON ON N6A1W1


 




Between:


Liam Muchan Shamminder Bahniwal


Tenants




 


 
and


 




 


Anna Komorowski


Landlord



 
 
 
Liam Muchan and
Shamminder Bahniwal (the 'Tenants') applied for an order determining that Anna
Komorowski (the 'Landlord') or the Landlord's superintendent harassed,
obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with them, entered the rental
unit illegally, substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
of the rental unit or residential complex
by the Tenants or by a member of their household and withheld or
deliberately interfered with the reasonable supply of a vital service, care
service, or food that the Landlord is obligated to supply under the tenancy
agreement.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on October 25, 2021.
The Tenants and the Landlord attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
It was uncontested that the superintendent Dominika Komorowski had entered the rental
unit illegally on June 26, 2020. This
was the only instance of illegal entry.
 
2.    
It was uncontested that the Landlord
had installed AC after the Tenants had moved in and that for a period of July 5 to
July 8, 2020 the AC was not working.
 
3.    
It was uncontested that
the Superintendent had been using offensive language towards the Tenants
repeatedly for an extended period
of time over the summer,
or that a guest of the Superintendent had also harassed
the Tenants. A video taken in September 2020 was played that contained
offensive and vulgar language towards the Tenants and demanded they open the
door to speak with the Superintendent.




 
4.    
Therefore, I find that
the Landlord or the Landlord's superintendent harassed or obstructed or coerced or threatened or interfered with the
Tenants, entered the rental unit illegally, substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenants or
by a member of their household.
 
5.    
I was not convinced
that the Landlord had withheld a vital service for the days in which the AC was
not working.  Therefore, I am not satisfied
that the Tenants
had proven on a
balance of probabilities that they had incurred any damages or loses from this.
 
6.    
The Tenants testified
that being in the rental unit was a living nightmare for them, that every time they attempted to discuss issues
with the Superintendent that it would lead to more bad relations with them. The
Tenants had moved into the rental unit in May 2020, and that by February 28,
2021 Shamminder Bahniwal had vacated the rental unit, while Liam Muchan had
vacated before then, due to the way they were treated by the Superintendent and
the Superintendents occupants or guests.
 
7.    
The Tenant’s
T2 application seeks as remedies
abatement of the rent, a cease and desist
order, an administrative fine, damages, out of pocket expenses and other
remedies as appropriate.
 
8.    
I do not believe
it is necessary or helpful
to issue a cease and desist order.
The Tenants have vacated and
the tenancy relationship is over.
 
9.    
With respect to an
administrative fine, although the Landlord’s behaviour was egregious there is no indication deterrence is necessary to ensure the behaviour is not repeated. No administrative fine shall be ordered.
 
10.  Given the harassment the Tenants are entitled to an abatement
of the rent of 10% for the period of the Tenancy, May 2020 to
February 2021, 11 months X $580.00 X 10% =
$638.00.
 
11.  As indicated above,
an order for damages or costs shall not be made, as I was not
satisfied that these are warranted under all the circumstances.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord
shall pay to the Tenants
$638.00 as rent abatement.
 
2.    
The Landlord
shall also pay to the Tenants $48.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
3.    
The total amount the Landlord owes is $686.00
 
4.    
The Landlord
shall pay the Tenants the full amount owing by January 17,
2022.
 
5.    
If the Landlord does not pay the Tenants
the full amount
owing by January
17, 2022, the Tenant will owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January
18, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
