Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-25000-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


806, 297 QUEENS AVENUE OAKVILLE ON L6H2B4


 




Between:


DMS Property Management Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Mahmoud Mohamed
  Mostafa Abdelnaby Youssef Mohamed


Tenants



 
 
 
DMS Property Management Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Mahmoud Mohamed, Youssef
Mohamed and Mostafa Abdelnaby (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay
the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 18, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Frank Calcagni, attended the hearing. As of 10:30 a.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective September 22, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $2,565.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,565.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from May 15, 2021 to
September 22, 2021.




File Number: SOL-25000-21
 
6.    
The Tenants paid $10,446.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenants and find
that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 28, 2022
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.
 
2.    
As of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the
Landlord is entitled to by $699.75*.
 
3.     However, the Landlord
is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount the
Landlord owes the Tenants:
$84.33 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
January 25, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit,
and
$186.00 for
the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     The Landlord or the Tenants
shall pay to the other
any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
7.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)          
$2,565.02 if the payment is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)         
$5,130.02 if the payment is made on or before
February 28, 2022**.
If the
Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.




File Number: SOL-25000-21
 
 
 
 
8.    
The Tenants may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that
subsection on or after March 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once
during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
