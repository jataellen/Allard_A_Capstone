Review Order
 
Minoo Nikpour
and Ali Ghafoori
(the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Jason Mandziak (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved by order TNL-32394-21 issued on August
9, 2021. On September 13,
2021, the Tenant requested a review of the order.
On September 22, 2021 interim
order TNL-32394-21-RV-IN was issued, staying
the order issued on August 9, 2021.
 
The request was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021.
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant stated he did not receive the Notice of Hearing because
he was staying with his ill
mother after July 1, 2021. The Tenant stated the Landlord never informed him of
the hearing nor did he speak to his worker about the hearing.
 
2.    
On the basis of the submissions made in the request, I am not satisfied that there is a
serious error in the order or that a serious error occurred in the proceedings.
 
3.    
The Tenants reasons
filed on the review request suggests the Landlord withheld the Tenant’s mail which was different from the reasons
he gave at the hearing.
There was no




File Number: TNL-32394-21
 
indication that the Tenant
has checked his mail or that he went to the unit to check the
mail while he was staying at his mother.
 
4.    
The Board’s mails
out the Notice to the parties as required
by the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').
The Board’s records
show that the Notice was mailed to the Tenant on June 28, 2021 to the same
address as the rental unit. Pursuant to subsection 191(3) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006, (the ‘Act’) the Notice is deemed to have been given 5 days
after mailing which in this
case is July 3, 2021. The
Board has no record of the
Notice being returned by Canada Post as undelivered.
 
5.     The Tenant stated he did not receive the
order which was also mailed to the same address as the rental
unit. To date the Tenant
states he has not received
the order. There was no reasonable explanation
provided why he would not contact the Board to obtain a copy.
 
6.    
The Tenant challenged
the calculations of arrears owing claiming all his rent is paid through third
parties. The Landlord indicated that he did not receive payments from December
to April 2020 from third party as he did for other rent periods in the past. The
Tenant provided no explanation for the outstanding arrears for that period and maintained
it was paid. The Tenant is responsible to investigate and he had ample time to
sort out discrepancies with his third parties. The Tenant’s payment from third
party appears to have been impacted by the Tenant not having filed his taxes
and doesn’t establish that a serious error is contained in the order dated
August 9, 2021.
 
It
is ordered that:
 
1.    
The request
to review order TNL-32394-21 issued on August 9, 2021 is denied.
The order is confirmed and remains unchanged.
 
2.    
The interim
order issued on September 22, 2021 is cancelled. The stay of order TNL- 32394-21 is lifted.
