Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26837-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


UNIT 3, 414 FAIRFIELD AVENUE HAMILTON ON L8H5H9


 




Between:


Katherine Fizell


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jennifer Welsh


Tenant



 
 
 
Katherine Fizell (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jennifer Welsh (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant
owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on
January 17, 2022 with respect to application SOL-25573-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenant failed to pay $100.00 towards the
arrears on December 24, and December 31, 2021.
The Tenant failed to pay $100.00 towards
the arrears, on or
before January 7, and
January 14, 2022. The Tenant
failed to pay the lawful
monthly rent, on or before
January 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$4,236.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application
fee in Order SOL-25573-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $4,236.00
and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous
order SOL-25573-21 is cancelled.




 
5.    
Since the date of the
order, the Tenant has failed
to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from December 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.
 
6.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,350.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2022 to February 1, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SOL-25573-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 12, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$5,586.00*. This amount represents the rent owing up to February 1, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $44.38
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 2, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February
12, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 13, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 12, 2022, then starting
February 13, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 13, 2022.

The tenant has until February 11, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by February 11, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on August 13, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date
with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
