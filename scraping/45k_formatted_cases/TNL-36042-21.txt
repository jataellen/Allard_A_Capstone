Jasoda Bacchus


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Okeke Collins
 


Tenant



Jasoda Bacchus (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Okeke Collins (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage.
 
The Landlord also applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant
because the Tenant, another occupant
of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex
has wilfully caused undue damage to the premises or used the rental unit or the
residential complex in a manner that is inconsistent with use as a residential
premises and that has caused or can be expected to cause significant damage.
The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate
the Landlord for the damage.
 
The Landlord also applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant
because the Tenant, another occupant
of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex
has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord in a residential complex that has three
or fewer residential units.
 
The Landlord also applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
the Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental
unit or a person the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has seriously
impaired the safety of any person
 
The hearing
was held via video conference on February 3, 2022.
Only the Tenant attended the hearing.

File Number: TNL-36042-21
 
2.    
I
waited until 9:30am
and I canvased the virtual
hearing room, the virtual reception area, the virtual waiting room and all of the breakout rooms to
confirm whether the Landlord attended the hearing. The Landlord’s name did not
appear in any of these areas and I was satisfied that the Landlord failed to
attend the hearing.
 
3.    
Since the Landlord did not appear
at the hearing to support
their application, I found that this application had been abandoned
and I dismissed the Tenant.
 
4.    
At approximately 10:30am, a person
entered the hearing room who was difficult to understand but who presented
himself as representing the Landlord. This person explained that he had “sent a message” to the Board saying he would be 30
minutes late. I explained to him that
he was almost 2 hours late, his matter had been declared abandoned and I
dismissed him from the hearing room.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord's application is dismissed as
abandoned.
