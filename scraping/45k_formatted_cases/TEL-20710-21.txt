Tenant



 
 
Yatinkumar Patel (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jillian Noran Doris
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or
someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently
caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage; because the
Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in
the residential complex has wilfully caused undue damage to the premises and used the rental unit or the residential
complex in a manner that is inconsistent with use as a residential premises and
that has caused or can be expected to cause significant damage. The Landlord
has also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord
for the damage; because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or
someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another tenant; because the number of persons living in the unit on a continuing basis is more than permitted
by health, safety or housing standards; and because
the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex has seriously impaired the safety of any
person. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 974 4825 8231#
on February 1, 2022.
Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
Preliminary Issue:
 
1.    The Tenant continues to pay rent even though she
hasn’t been in the rental unit since November
2, 2021. The tenancy has not been terminated by agreement, by Notice or by
Board Order. The Tenant’s worker (ForCAST) has communicated with the
Landlord and was informed the Tenant intends to return to the rental unit. The
Tenant has lawful possession of the rental unit.
 
N5 Notice:




 
 
 
2.   
The Tenant was given a first N5
Notice of Termination under sections 62, 64 and 67 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').
The Tenant voided the N5 Notice, given under section
64 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act' by stopping the noise
disturbances involving loud music, yelling and slamming of doors. This notice
was void because the Tenant corrected the problem within the time period (November
3 to 10, 2021) set out in the notice.
 
3.   
Under section 62 of the Act,
the Tenant did not repair or pay $15,000.00 for damage to void the N5 Notice.
The Landlord sought $15,000.00 which are unreasonable costs to repair or replace the damage property.
The police charged
the Tenant with mischief under
$5,000.00 for damage caused to
the property. Given the misinformation and elevated damage cost on the N5 Notice,
there was no fair opportunity for the Tenant
to void the N5
Notice.
 
4.   
The N5 Notice refers to one guest staying
with the Tenant.
The Landlord did not lead any
evidence to prove the Tenant had more people living in the unit that was
permitted by health, safety or housing standards as required under section 67
of the Act.
 
N7 Notice:
 
5.   
The N7 refers to an incident of
assault involving another tenant in the complex on October 9, 2021, and noise disturbances from the Tenant’s
guest on October
26, 27 and November 2, 2021
as well as general damage to the rental unit that led to mischief charges.
 
6.    Despite several attempts for information about the
occurrence on October 9, 2021, the Landlord did not lead any evidence about the claim
to prove the Tenant or guest seriously impaired the safety of another
person.
 
7.   
The Landlord did not lead evidence
about the noise disturbance caused by the
Tenant’s guest on October 26, 27,
and 28, 2021. The Landlord also
reported noise complaint and
mischief on November 2, 2021 but this formed the basis of
the N5 Notice of Termination and the Tenant corrected the problem within
the seven-day voiding
period. The Landlord failed to establish such
disturbances could impair the safety of another person.
 
8.    On the face of the N7 Notice, there was no details
about the physical damage caused to the rental unit. Even if there was, the Landlord
also gave an N5 Notice
for damage. This is
important to note because a component of section 63(1)(a) is that the Landlord
must provide evidence that the damage is significantly greater than damage
required under a N5 Notice or section 62 (1) of the Act whereby the
Tenant has an opportunity to void.
 
Damage Claim
 
9.    The Landlord also applied for damage of $15,000.00 under
subsection 89(1) of the
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act') that states,
 
A landlord
may apply to the Board for an order requiring a tenant to pay reasonable costs that the landlord has incurred or will incur for the
repair of or, where repairing is not




 
reasonable, the replacement of damaged property,
if the tenant, another occupant
of the rental unit or a
person whom the tenant permits in the residential complex wilfully or
negligently causes undue damage to the rental unit or the residential complex
and the tenant is in possession of the rental unit.
 
10. Section 89 of the Act is intended to allow a landlord
to apply for the cost of repairing or replacing actual physical damage to the rental unit or residential
complex. It is not enough for a
landlord to simply rely on his list of damaged property on the L2 application
and expect the Board to accept it on its face. The Landlord
must adduce sufficient evidence to satisfy me
that the Tenants committed the act of damaging the Landlord’s property either
with intention or by being careless. The Landlord also has the onus of proving
that the damage was beyond normal wear and tear and distinguish between damage
caused by normal living and damage because the useful life of the property
expired.
 
11. The Landlord’s photographs support a finding that the
Tenant caused undue damage to the rental unit by breaking the toilet having
stuffed towels in the tank and cracking the cover and bowl of the tank;
removing one door of the bathroom vanity, and breaking the glass of the two kitchen cabinets,
and cracking one window pane in the unit. The Landlord
has replaced the damage toilet and incurred reasonable costs of $175.00. He did
not provide any estimate or have any idea as to the costs he expects to incur
to replace the other damaged property that cannot be reasonably repaired.
 
12. For the reasons
noted above, the Landlord’s application for eviction is denied.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $175.00,
which represents the reasonable costs
of replacing the damaged property.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall also pay the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before February 20, 2022, the Tenant will start
to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 21, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
