In the matter
of:


1713, 377 RIDELLE AVENUE TORONTO ON M6B1K2


 




Between:


Nubury Properties Limited..


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Adgar J.m. Banos Miriam B. Torres


Tenants



 
 
 
On January 10, 2022, Nubury
Properties Limited.. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Miriam
B. Torres and Adgar J.m. Banos (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent
they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order
issued by the Board on March 22, 2021 with respect to application TNL- 27908-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants
have not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The
Tenants did not pay $2,812.56 arrears on or before December 30, 2021. The
Tenants did not pay $2,216.93 rent on or before January 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears
of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $14,812.56 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order TNL-27908-20. The amount that is still owing from that
order is $4,162.56 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order TNL-27908-20 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became owing.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,141.93 from the
Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from October
1, 2021 to February 3, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order TNL-27908-20 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 14, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $4,583.59*.
(Less any amounts paid since the application was filed on January 10, 2022.)
This amount represents the rent owing up to February 3, 2022 and the costs
related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $72.89 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 4, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
14, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 15, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 14, 2022, then starting
February 15, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 15, 2022.
