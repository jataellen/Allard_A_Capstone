Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-86027-17
 










 
 
 

P.
M. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict M.
C. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. 
This is an L1 application.
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the
Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with
the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord
in a residential complex that has three or fewer residential units. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit
after the termination date. This is an L2 application.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on January 16, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
NON-PAYMENT
OF RENT APPLICATION
1.     The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from October 1, 2017 to January 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective November 16, 2017.
2.     The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $550.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
3.     Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from March 1, 2017 to
November 16, 2017.
4.     The
Landlord incurred costs of $190.00 for filing the application and entitled to
reimbursement of those costs. 
SUBSTANTIAL
INTERFERENCE APPLICATION
5.      The
Tenant rents a room in the basement of the Landlord’s house.  
6.      The
Tenant has been threatening the other tenant in the basement and causing
conflict with the other tenant.  The Tenant has told the other tenant that she
could have a television stand and now tells the tenant it must be given back.
7.      The
other tenant also told the Landlord that there was an altercation with the
Tenant and the other tenant almost fell into the fridge.  
8.      The
Landlord stated she attempted to perform an inspection of the rental unit;
however, found the Tenant had changed the locks to her rental unit.
9.      Based
on the uncontested evidence before the Board, I am satisfied the Tenant’s
conduct has substantially interfered with the Landlord's and the other tenant’s
reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex and with a lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord.
10.  I have
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1)
of the Act.
11.  This
order contains all of the reasons for my decision within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.  
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before March 9, 2018.
2.     The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,127.58*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to February 26, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $18.08 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 27, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
4.     The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.     If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March
9, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from March 10, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     If
the unit is not vacated on or before March 9, 2018, then starting March 10,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 10, 2018.
