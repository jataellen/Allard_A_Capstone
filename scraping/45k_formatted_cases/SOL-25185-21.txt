Order under Section

Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-25185-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


204, 851 LAWRENCE ROAD HAMILTON ON L8K6B9


 




Between:


Valery Properties


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Brad Urquhart


Tenant



 
 
 
Valery Properties (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Brad Urquhart (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 18, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Tina Novak, attended the hearing.
As of 1:51 p.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from September 1, 2021 to
January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 24, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,646.39.
 
4.    
The Tenant paid
nearly all arrears for the period ending January 31, 2022, as only a balance of $9.43 remains.
 
5.    
As a result, the order will be limited
to the remaining arrears
and the Landlord’s costs of filing the application only and not eviction.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $195.43
($9.43 arrears and $186.00
for the cost of filing the
application).




File Number: SOL-25185-21
 
2.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February
6, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 7, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
