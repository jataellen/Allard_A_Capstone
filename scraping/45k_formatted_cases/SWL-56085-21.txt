In the matter
of:


214B, 835 DEVINE
STREET SARNIA ON N7T7P6


 




Between:


Skyline Living


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Anne Wolsey


Tenant



 
 
 
Skyline Living (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Anne Wolsey
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or
someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another tenant.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on January
31, 2022. Only the Landlord’s legal agent, M. Beaton (MB), attended the hearing. As of 10:03
a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord served an N5 Notice of Termination on the
Tenant on October 6, 2021. The N5
Notice alleges that on July 15, 2021, it was discovered that the Tenant had
disconnected the hydro to her unit. On September 1, 2021, the Landlord confirmed that the hydro was
still disconnected.
 
2.    
Subsection 64 (1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’)
states:
 
A landlord
may give a tenant notice
of termination of the tenancy
if the conduct of the tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the tenant is
such that it substantially interferes with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex for all usual purposes
by the landlord or another tenant or substantially interferes
with another lawful right, privilege or interest of the landlord or another
tenant. 2006, c. 17, s. 64 (1).
 
3.     Subsection 64(3) states that the notice of termination
under subsection (1) is void if the tenant,
within seven days after receiving the notice, stops the conduct
or activity or corrects
the omission.




 
4.    
On a balance of probabilities, I
find this conduct has substantially interfered with the Landlord's lawful
right, privilege or interest. MB testified that the Landlord and the Tenant
entered a tenancy agreement, which provides, in part, that the Tenant
is responsible for all
costs of electricity provided to the rental unit and to provide details of the
arrangement to the Landlord. Further,
the Tenant is interfering the Landlord’s obligation to keep the building
up to code with health
and safety and the
Landlord could be held liable
for the absence of hydro in the
Tenant’s unit.
 
5.    
MB testified that the Tenant did not reconnect
the hydro in the unit within seven days after the notice was served. As such, I
am also satisfied that the Tenant did not void the N5 Notice.
 
6.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
7.     MB testified that the Tenant was contacted in
September 2021 to offer community resources for financial assistance in
reconnecting hydro to the unit. The Tenant did not respond and to the date of
the hearing, the Tenant did not have hydro.
 
8.     In consideration of the foregoing, and the fact that the Tenant did not attend
the hearing to disclose any circumstances for me to
consider denying or delaying eviction, relief will not be granted.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of March 7, 2022. The
Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before March 7, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before March 7, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from March 8, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit is not vacated on or before March 7, 2022,
then starting March 8, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction
may be enforced.
 
5.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord on or after March 8, 2022.
