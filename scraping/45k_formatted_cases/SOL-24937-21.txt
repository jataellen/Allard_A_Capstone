although properly served with the notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September

2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $750.00.

rent deposit of $750.00. This amount has been
applied to the month of January 2022.
 
5.     The Tenant paid $3,000.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.    
The Landlord’s Representative
presented to the Board an agreement to terminate the tenancy which had been
signed by both parties listing a termination date of January 31, 2022. As a
result, the application is amended to include an L3 application for termination
of the tenancy. The Tenant
no longer will have the option to void the eviction order
