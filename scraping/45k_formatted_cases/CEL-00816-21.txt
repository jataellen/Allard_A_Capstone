Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-00816-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


18, 35 CEREMONIAL DRIVE MISSISSAUGA ON L5R2L8


 




Between:


Averil Gomes


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Nadia Currie
  Omar Foster


Tenants



 
 
 
Averil Gomes (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Omar Foster
and Nadia Currie (the 'Tenants') because they have been persistently late in
paying their rent.
The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
919 0500 4258# on October
14, 2021. The Landlord’s
representative Sarah Teklu,
and the Tenants, represented by Sarah Teal, attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have been persistently late paying rent. For the past seven months the rent
has been paid on time.
 
2.    
The Tenants testified that due to
personal circumstances it is challenging to pay the rent on time and that the Landlord
will not accept
e-transfers for payment.
In addition, they do
not have a chequing account and are therefore required to pay for a month order
and deliver the funds to the Landlord’s mailbox.
 
3.     At the hearing
the Landlord’s representative agreed to accept rental payments
to the Landlord by e-transfer.
 
4.    
The Landlord’s representative
could not contact her client to
confirm the address to transfer the funds but ensured the Tenants and the Tenants’
representative that the address would be provided to both the
Tenants and the Tenants’ representative.
 
5.     I find a conditional order granting relief from
eviction is appropriate under the circumstances. Due to the fact the e-transfer address was not available at the
hearing, the conditions as set out below will begin in March 2022 due to the fact this order will not reach the parties before February 1,
2022.
