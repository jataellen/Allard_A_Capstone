Aram Kamali-Vahidi                                                                                                                 Tenant
 
 
On January 11, 2022, K&G
Oakburn Apartments I Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied in this L4 application for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Aram Kamali-Vahidi (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant
owes because the Tenant failed to meet
a condition specified in the consent order issued by the Board on December
9, 2021 with respect
to L1 application TNL-34035-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The previous consent order
provided that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet
certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I find that the Tenant has not met
the following condition specified in the order: The Tenant failed to pay
the lawful rent for January
2022 in full on or before January
1, 2022. This was a breach of paragraph 2 of the consent order. This L4
application was filed within 30 days of the breach.
 
3.       
The previous L1 application included a request
for an order for the payment
of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the
Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in
addition to eviction, in this L4 application the Landlord is entitled to
request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenant agreed to pay and was
ordered to pay $11,841.19 for rent arrears and the costs related to the
Landlord's application fee in consent order TNL-34035-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $10,835.82 and that amount
is included in this
order. As a result, the previous consent order TNL-34035-21 is cancelled.
 
5.       
Since the date of the consent
order, the Tenant
has failed to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from January
1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.




 
6.       
On December 1, 2016, the Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,900.00 from the
Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenant for the period from the
date of collection, December 1, 2016
to the date of this order, January 26, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The previous consent order TNL-34035-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 6, 2022 (standard 11 days from the
issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
If the Tenant made any payments
to the Landlord after this L4 application was filed on January 11, 2022, those amounts shall
be deducted from the calculations below.
 
Refer to attached Summary
of Calculations
 
4.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$10,495.91*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to January 26, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous L1 application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes
on the rent deposit.
 
5.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $65.58 per day for
compensation for the use of the unit starting January 27, 2022 to
the date the Tenant actually moves out of the rental unit or gets evicted.
 
6.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
6, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 7, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 6, 2022, then starting February
7, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 7, 2022.
 
 
January 26, 2022

The tenant
has until February
7, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by February 7, 2022 the order will be
stayed and the Board will schedule a hearing.

to the eviction expires on August
7, 2022 if the order has not been filed
on or before this date with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the
rental unit is located.
