Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-23389-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


3, 11 STIRTON STREET HAMILTON ON L8L6E7


 




Between:


Olga Stech Stefan
Stech


Landlords




 


and


 




 


Adam Barker


Tenant



 
 
 
Olga Stech and Stefan Stech (the
'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Adam
Barker (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on October 20, 2021.
 
The Landlord, Olga Stech, and
the Tenant attended the hearing. Patricia Golden, the Tenant’s aunt, provided
support for the Tenant. The Tenant spoke with Tenant
Duty Counsel prior
to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
On July 7, 2021 the Landlords
gave the Tenant
an N12 notice of termination for landlord’s own
use. The termination date on the N12 notice is September 30, 2021. The notice indicated that the child of the
Landlords required the use of the rental unit.
 
2.     The Landlords have not met the requirements under
subsection 72(1)(a) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’), which requires
the filing with the Board an
affidavit sworn by the person who personally intends to occupy the rental unit in good faith for a period of at
lest one year.
 
3.     The Landlords filed a letter from the Landlords’ daughter
that is signed and dated July 14, 2021. The letter does not indicate
how long she will reside
in the unit, nor does it indicate that she requires the rental
unit for residential purposes in good faith.
Moreover, the letter is not “sworn”.
 
4.     Rule 1.5 of the Landlord and Tenant Board’s Rules of
Procedure sets out that where the Act requires an affidavit respecting a
specified statement or specified information, the LTB will also accept
a signed and dated declaration containing the specified
statement or




File Number: SOL-23389-21
 
specified information provided the declaration confirms
the truth of the information or statement and acknowledges that making a false declaration is
an offense.
 
5.    
The Landlords elected not to call their daughter
as a witness to testify
at the hearing.
 
6.     I find that the letter
does not meet the legal requirements under subsection 72(1)(a)
of the Act and does not comply
with the Rules.
 
7.     I therefore must dismiss the Landlords’ application for failing to comply with affidavit
requirements.
 
8.     The Landlord testified
at the hearing that they provided the Tenant with a cheque for one month’s rent as compensation for the N12 in
accordance with subsection 55.1 of the
Act in the amount of $590.00 on July 20, 2021.
The Landlord indicated at the hearing that the Tenant had not cashed the
cheque.
 
9.     However, since I am refusing to grant the Landlord’s
application for not providing the required affidavit, I will hereby order that
the Tenant either return the cheque or, if they have cashed it, pay the amount
back to the Landlords pursuant
to subsection 73.1 of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlords’ application to evict the Tenant for the purpose
of residential occupation by the Landlords’ daughter is dismissed.
 
2.     The Tenant shall return the compensation cheque
to the Landlords or, if they have cashed it, pay the amount that he
received back to the Landlords by no later than February 28, 2022.
 
3.     If the Tenant does not pay the full amount outstanding
by February 28, 2022 then the Tenant will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated at a rate of 2.0% annually on the outstanding amount.
