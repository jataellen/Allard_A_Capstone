Jamie Basso Ryan Kilbourne


Tenants




 
 
 
Rahila Zahid (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ryan Kilbourne and
Jamie Basso (the 'Tenants') because
they or another occupant of the rental unit have committed an illegal act or
have carried out, or permitted someone to carry out an illegal trade, business
or occupation in the rental unit or the residential complex. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by video conference on July 22, 2021.
The Landlord and the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Landlord seeks an order
terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants because they or another occupant
of the rental unit have committed an illegal act in the rental unit or the residential complex.
 
2.       
On April 23, 2021 the Landlord
served an N6 Notice to End Your Tenancy with a
termination date of May 12, 2021.
 
3.       
The Landlord claims that on April 16, 2021 the Landlord
became aware that “there were guns in the vicinity”, and that “the
police found a number of firearms that were unregistered”.
 
4.       
The Landlord also claims in the
application that the Tenants live in a rent-geared-to- income (“RGI”) unit and
have mispresented their income. Specifically, the Landlord submits in the
application that the unit was rented to two Tenants but an additional occupant was residing in the unit without the Landlord’s permission. The Landlord seeks




File Number: TEL-16600-21
 
an order that the occupant pay rent of $925.00 per month for the period
of four months commencing on February 2021.
 
5.       
Finally, the Landlord claims
that the Tenants
are not paying
the lawful rent as it becomes
due and have failed to pay the utilities for which they are responsible in
accordance with the lease agreement.
 
6.       
I find that these allegations
(“there were guns in the vicinity” and “the
police found a number of firearms
that were unregistered” are too vague to be the basis of a termination
of tenancy. The Tenants’ alleged
illegal acts must be outlined with
some specificity (Ball
v. Metro Capital Property, [2002] O.J. No. 5931
(Divisional Court)). In this instance,
the information provided is ambiguous.
 
7.       
With respect to the claims that
the Tenants mispresented their income un an RGI unit, and that the Tenants
have failed to pay rent and utilities, those applications are not before the Board at this hearing and
cannot be considered.
 
8.       
This order contains all of the reasons for my decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
