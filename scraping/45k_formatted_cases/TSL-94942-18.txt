Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-94942-18










 

T.R
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict M.J
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes
(``the L1 application”).
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the
Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with
the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord
or another tenant; and has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the
premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to
compensate the Landlord for the damage. The Landlord also claimed compensation
for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date (“the
L2 application”).
 
These
applications were heard in Toronto on June 14, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, M.W (“MW”) and
the Landlord’s legal representative, N.P (“NP”) attended the hearing.   The
Tenant did not attend the hearing although I was satisfied that he received
proper notice of the time, place and location of the hearing. Nonetheless, I
waited until after 10 a.m.  When the Tenant still did not arrive, I proceeded
to hear the Landlord’s applications.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The Tenant
has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
February 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination effective April 22, 2018.
 
2.      With
respect to the L1 application, NP submitted at the hearing a summary of the
Landlord’s claims for arrears of rent and the filing fee as of the hearing
date. 
 
3.      The L2
application was preceded by an N5 Notice served upon the Tenant effective April
17, 2018 and bearing a termination date of May 7, 2018 (“the N5”).  With an N5
Notice a tenant is given the opportunity to void the N5 within 7 days of it
being served.  The voiding period for the purposes of the N5 was April 18-24,
2018 (“the voiding period”).
 
4.      MW also
provided oral and documentary evidence indicating that the Tenant has been
renting out the unit – a condominium in downtown Toronto – on Airbnb since on
or about June 2016   MW testified that the guests permitted in the unit by the
Tenant further to its use as a short-term rental, have wilfully or negligently
damaged the unit.   MW testified that in June 2016, a guest of the Tenant’s
left the window open during a windstorm, resulting in the window detaching and
falling 40 floors to the ground below.  NP filed documentation showing that the
Landlord had incurred expenses in the amount of $1,926.36 in respect to that
incident.  Further, MW described that on April 6, 2018, a second window left
open by someone permitted in the unit by the Tenant blew off the building,
causing the Landlord to incur costs of at least $697.00 to address this
negligent damage. 
 
5.      MW
summarized that the N5 was two-pronged: for the negligent damage noted above by
those permitted in the unit by the Tenant; and because the Tenant continues to
rent out the unit on Airbnb, substantially interfering with the lawful rights,
privileges or interests of the Landlord.
 
6.      MW
submitted into evidence correspondence from the condominium corporation from
both before and after the voiding period, indicating that the condominium
corporation has verified that the Tenant continues to use the unit as an Airbnb
and threatening the Landlord with action, including legal action, if no steps
are taken by the Landlord to stop such use.
 
7.      MW
testified that despite attempts to discuss the matter with the Tenant, he has
had no response to various messages left for the Tenant and the Landlord has
had no payment for damage done to the unit.
 
8.      Based upon
the uncontested evidence provided to me at the hearing, I am satisfied, on a
balance of probabilities that:
 
•       
The
Tenant or someone permitted in the residential complex by the Tenant has
wilfully or  negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit by damaging
the windows;
•       
The
Landlord has incurred costs of $2,623.36 to replace the damaged windows;
•       
Since
June 2016, the Tenant has been renting out the rental unit as an Airbnb,
contrary to the condominium’s rules, arising out of which the Landlord may face
legal action which substantially interferes with the Landlord’s rights,
privileges and interests;
•       
The
Tenant has neither paid the Landlord for any damage to the unit nor stopped
renting out the unit as an Airbnb during the voiding period;
 
9.      I have
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1)
of the Act.
 
It
is ordered that:
 
L1
application
 
1.      Unless the
Tenant voids the L1 portion of this order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the
rental unit on or before July 17, 2018.
2.      The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord $4,843.80*, which represents the amount of rent owing
and compensation up to July 6, 2018.
3.      The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $58.36 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting July 7, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.      The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.      If the
Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before July 17,
2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from July 18, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If the
unit is not vacated on or before July 17, 2018, then starting July 18, 2018,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 18, 2018.
8.      If, on or
before July 17, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $6,472.96** to the Landlord
or to the Board in trust, the L1 portion of this eviction order for eviction
will be void, subject to the L2 portion of this order below.  This means that
the tenancy would not be terminated under the L1 portion of this order and the
Tenant could remain in the unit to July 17, 2018 on which date the tenancy is
terminated under the L2 portion of this order below.   If this payment is not
made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The Tenant
may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside
the L1 portion of this order, subject to the L2 portion of this order below, if
the Tenant pays the amount required under that subsection on or after July 18,
2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant
is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
L2
application
 
10.   If the
Tenant pays the amount set out in paragraph 8 of the L1 portion of this order,
the tenancy shall continue to July 17, 2018 on which date the tenancy is
terminated for wilful or negligent damage to the unit; and substantial
interference with the Landlord’s rights, privileges or interests. The tenancy
between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated, as of July 17, 2018. The
Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before July 17, 2018.
 
11.   The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord $2,623.36 which represents the reasonable costs of
replacing the damaged windows in the unit.
 
12.   If the
Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before July 17,
2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from July 18, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
13.   If the
unit is not vacated on or before July 17, 2018, then starting July 18, 2018,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
14.   Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after July 18, 2018.
