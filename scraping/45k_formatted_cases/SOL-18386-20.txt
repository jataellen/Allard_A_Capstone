Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-18386-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


22, 413 KING
STREET W HAMILTON ON L8P1B5


 




Between:


David Emery


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Paul Jenson


Tenant



 
 
 
David Emery
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Paul Jenson
(the 'Tenant')
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 10, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord
attended the hearing. The Tenant
did not attend,
although properly served with notice of hearing by the
Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The residential complex is a lodging house,
with approximately 10 tenants living in close proximity to each other.
 
2.    
The Landlord served the
Tenant with a second Form N5, on the basis the Tenant ‘s behaviour, or the behaviour of someone visiting or living with the Tenant has substantially interfered with another
tenant’s or the Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex
and/or lawful rights, privileges, or interests.
 
3.     The Landlord relies
predominantly upon (2) events in its Form N5.
 
4.    
The first incident
involves the Tenant creating a fire hazard in the residential complex by
leaving large appliances in the common areas.
The Landlord testified that on October 12 2020, the Tenant left his
large dresser, mirror and stove in the common area hallways which impeded access
to this area for other tenants. Further,
on November 10, 2020,
the Tenant left his freezer in the kitchen which prevented the fire door
from opening all the way. The Landlord
submitted that the Tenant’s actions violate the fire code, and that he has
received complains from other tenants.
 
5.    
The second event
involves the Tenant freely distributing his passcode to the secure front door entrance to other non-tenants, a contravention that the Tenant has acknowledged
to




 
the Landlord. The Landlord
testified that on October 13, 2020, two of the tenant’s guests entered the
passcode to gain access to the building and subsequently enter the Tenant’s unit.
 
6.    
The Landlord further advised that the Tenant’s guests were caught leaving needles in the common areas, thereby creating a
safety concern to other residents.
 
7.     I find on a balance of probabilities that
the Tenant’s behaviour has
substantially interfered with another Tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of the
rental unit due to the safety concerns created by (i) blocking/impeding access
to certain common areas with his personal possessions; and, by (ii)
distributing his passcode to visitors who have left needles in the building.
 
8.    
Section 83 requires that I consider
all the circumstances, including the Tenant’s
and the Landlord’s situations
to determine if it would be appropriate to grant section 83 relief
from eviction. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
9.     The Landlord indicated that the Tenant
lives alone. This is the second N5
served for similar issues and the Tenant has not shown any willingness to
change or improve his behaviour.
 
10.  The Tenant did not attend the hearing,
and thus did not provide
any evidence that may be relevant to my determination under s.
83.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated, as of January 31, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 31, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022, then starting
February 1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
3.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 1, 2022.

this date with the Court Enforcement
