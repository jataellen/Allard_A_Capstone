Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number:
TSL-23840-21
 



In the matter
of:


2110, 25 TELEGRAM MEWS TORONTO ON M5V3Z1


 




Between:


Chiwai Lau Yuenching Low


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Daniel
Goguen


Tenant



 
 
 
Chiwai Lau and
Yuenching Low (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Daniel Goguen (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on December 15, 2021. Only the Landlords’ Agent, Amanda Richards, attended
the hearing. As of 2:13 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from February 20, 2021 to December 19, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective August 29, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $2,200.00.
 
4.    
The Landlords
collected a rent deposit of $2,200.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlords.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from March 21, 2020 to August 29, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $5,900.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the parties and whether
the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 16, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $3,317.69*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 5, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords
$72.33 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 6, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlords
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before January
16, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January
17, 2022, the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that
the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after January 17, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 16, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $6,653.00** to the Landlords or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.
This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain
in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
17, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
