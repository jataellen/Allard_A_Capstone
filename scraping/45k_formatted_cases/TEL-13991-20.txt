In the matter
of:


106, 806 KENNEDY TORONTO ON M1K2E1


 




Between:


Metcap Living

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Francis Brannan


Tenant



 
 
Metcap Living Management Inc.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order requiring
Francis Brannan (the 'Tenant') to pay compensation for the money the Tenant
should have paid had the Tenant not misrepresented the Tenant's income or the income of a member
of the Tenant's family. The Landlord also claimed compensation for
each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 11, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s
Legal Representative, Sara Mathew, attended the hearing. As of 10:19 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at
the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord terminated the employment of the Tenant
on November 23, 2020. The Tenant vacated the superintendent's
premises on September 30, 2021.
 
2.     The Landlord is seeking compensation for the Tenant’s
use of the unit commencing on December
1, 2020 until the date the Tenant vacated the unit.
 
3.    
Sections 93 and 94 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’) provide as follows:
 
93(1) If a landlord has entered into a tenancy agreement with respect to
a superintendent’s premises, unless otherwise agreed, the tenancy terminates on
the day on which the employment of the tenant is terminated.
 
(2)  A tenant shall vacate a
superintendent’s premises within one week after his or her tenancy is terminated.




 
(3)   A landlord shall not charge a tenant
rent or compensation or receive rent or compensation from a tenant with respect
to the one-week period mentioned in subsection (2).
 
94 The landlord may apply to the Board for an order terminating the
tenancy of a tenant of superintendent’s premises and evicting the tenant if the
tenant does not vacate the rental unit within one week of the termination of
his or her employment.
 
4.     Section 93(2) of the Act makes it
clear that superintendents must vacate the unit within one week after
employment ends. When a tenant does not vacate a superintendent unit pursuant
to the Act, a landlord is entitled to file an application under section 94 of
the Act for termination of the tenancy.
 
5.     While section 93(3) of the Act states
that the landlord cannot charge a tenant any rent for the first seven days
after the termination of their employment, there is no mention in this section
of whether the landlord is entitled to compensation from the tenant if the
tenant remains in the rental unit after the seven day period has expired.
Section 86 of the Act entitles a landlord to compensation for use and
occupation of a rental unit by a tenant after the tenancy has terminated as a
result of notice, agreement of Board order. Moreover, s. 87(3) allows a
landlord to apply to the Board for an order requiring an overholding tenant to
pay compensation.
 
6.     In my view, it is unlikely that the
Legislature intended to confer a right to compensation upon a landlord under s.
93 without allowing that landlord to pursue a remedy before the Board. In my
view, it is likely that a superintendent unit’s tenancy terminates upon
termination of the employment relationship. Thus, when the superintendent is
given notice that their employment is
terminated, this constitutes notice that the tenancy is termination as well.
Accordingly, I find I have jurisdiction to award compensation to the Landlord
for the use of the unit by the Tenant.
 
7.     In this case, the Tenant’s seven day
rent free period ran from November 23, 2020 to November 30, 2020. The Tenant did not vacate the unit until
September 30, 2021. Consequently, the Tenant owes the Landlord compensation for
the use of the unit from December 1, 2020 until September 30, 2021.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of September 30, 2021,
the date the Tenant gave vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.




 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $13,525.10*, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from December 1, 2020 to September 30,
2021.
 
3.    
The Landlord is not holding a last month’s
rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Landlord is waiving
the application filing
fee.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount*
owing on or before February
13, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 14, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
