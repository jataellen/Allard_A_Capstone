Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-87952-18
 










 
 
 

C.
S. and J. S. (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict P. B. and J. T. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the
rent that the Tenants owe and because they have been persistently late in
paying their rent. The Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This
application was heard in Peterborough on February 15, 2018.
 
The first-named Landlord, the Landlords’ representative, R. B., and
the Tenants attended the hearing. 
 
Determinations:
 
THE APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from December 1, 2017 to February 28, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective January 17, 2018.
2.      The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending February 28, 2018, total $2,018.75.
3.      The
Landlord incurred costs as a result of filing the application in the amount of
$190.00 and is entitled to reimbursement for those costs. 
4.      The
Landlords collected a rent deposit of $1,050.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlords.
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2015
to January 17, 2018.
6.      The
Tenants paid $1,268.75 after the application was filed.
7.      The
Tenants do not dispute the amount of arrears, but at the hearing, they
requested a delay until March 1, 2018, to pay the full outstanding amount. The
Landlord did not object to this position. 
8.      As
the March 1st date has already passed, an order will issue for the
standard 11 day period to allow the Tenants to pay the outstanding arrears. 
THE APPLICATION FOR PERSISTENTLY
LATE PAYMENT
9.      There
is no dispute that the Tenants had an agreement with the second-named Landlord
which allowed them to pay their rent in two monthly installments; one payment
of $500.00 on the first day of each month and another payment of $750.00 on the
20th day of each month.
10.   However,
the Tenants say that they had an additional agreement with the second-named
Landlord which allowed them to pay their rent after the 20th of each
month. The second-named Landlord was not present at the hearing to testify and
the Tenants were unable to provide any texts or other documentary evidence to
confirm their testimony. 
11.   Based
on the evidence before me, I am not satisfied that the Tenants had an agreement
with the Landlord which allowed them to pay their rent after the 20th
day of each month. The Tenants said they reached this agreement over text, but
could not produce the texts at the hearing. The Landlords’ representative
disputes that such an agreement exists and I do not find it plausible that,
after having already agreed to allow the Tenants to pay in two installments,
the Landlord would make a second agreement to allow the Tenants to pay their
rent even later in the month. 
12.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). In
particular, I have considered that the Tenants have lived in the rental unit
since 2015. The Tenants live in the rental unit with their 4 children; a 17
year old son with special needs, a 15 year old son, an 11 year old son and a 21
year old daughter who may be moving out shortly. 
13.   The
Tenants say they are able to pay their rent “on time” pursuant to the original
agreement they had with the Landlord to pay in two installments. Based on the
Tenants monthly income, and their projected monthly income when the
second-named Tenant returns to work or receives an increase in his benefits, I
am satisfied that the Tenants can pay their rent in two installments. I have
also considered that the Landlord does not object to an order requiring the
Tenants to pay on time, in two installments, for a 12 month period. I find that
it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the conditions
set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.

 
It is
ordered that:
THE
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before March 18, 2018.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $1,129.66*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to March 7, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $41.71 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting March 8, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before March
18, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from March 19, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before March 18, 2018, then starting March 19,
2018, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after March 19,
2018.
8.      If,
on or before March 18, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $3,477.50** to the
Landlords or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after March 19, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlords. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
THE APPLICATION FOR
PERSISTENTLY LATE PAYMENT
10.   If the
Tenants void the eviction order for non-payment of rent pursuant to paragraphs
8 or 9 above then the Tenants shall pay to the Landlord new rent on time by
paying $500.00 on or before the first day of each month and $750.00 on or
before the 20th day of each month for the period commencing April 1,
2018, to March 31, 2018,.  
11.   If the
Tenants fail to make any one of the payments in accordance with paragraph 10 of
this order the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenants, apply to the Board
pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and
evicting the Tenants and requiring that the Tenant pays any new arrears, NSF fees
and related charges that became owing after February 28, 2018.
