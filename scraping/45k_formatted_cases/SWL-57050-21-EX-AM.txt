In the matter
of:


114, 84 OAKVILLE AVENUE LONDON ON N5V2S5


 




Between:


Amiraco Properties Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Wayne Oliver


Tenant



 
 
 
This amended order
is issued to correct a clerical error
in the original order issued on January 4, 2022.
 
Amiraco Properties Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Wayne Oliver (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in
the order issued by the Board on October 1, 2021 with respect to application
SWL-54011-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain
condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    I find that the Tenant
has not met the following condition specified in the order: The Tenant
failed to pay the lawful monthly rent on or before November 1, 2021.
 
3.    Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full
rent that became owing for the period from October 1, 2021 to
November 30, 2021.
 
4.    The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $610.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.    Interest on the rent deposit
has been paid to the Tenant up to December
31, 2020, which is included in this order. There is
no further interest owing since there was no guideline rent increase allowed
(consequently no interest) in 2021 due to COVID19.




 
It is
ordered that:
 
 
 
1.   
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 15, 2022.
 
2.   
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $969.83*. This amount
represents the rent owing up to January 4, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the previous
application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
 
3.   
The Tenant shall also pay to the
Landlord $26.97 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 5, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
15, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
5.    If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 15, 2022, then starting
January 16, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.   
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord on or after January 16, 2022.

The tenant has until January 14, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 14, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires

with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction
where the rental unit is located.
