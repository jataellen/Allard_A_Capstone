Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-25806-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


BSMT, 36 DIVISION STREET HAMILTON ON L8H4Z6


 




Between:


Cornerstone Select
Properties


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Erica Berry


Tenant



 
 
 
Cornerstone Select Properties (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Erica Berry (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 2, 2022.
 
Only Violeta
Tocaley, on behalf of the
Landlord attended the hearing.
As of 9:33 a.m., the Tenant
was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
Based on the particulars contained in the N8 Notice
of Eviction served
to the Tenant by mail on November 3, 2021, I find that from May
2021 to November 3, 2021, the Tenant was late paying her
rent 7 months out of the 7-month period.
 
2.     The Landlord’s Agent testified that the Tenant emailed
the Landlord on December 29, 2021 that she w vacating on or before January 31,
2021, therefore the Landlord is seeking an order
terminating the tenancy
January 31, 2021 plus the application filing
fee. She also testified that the Tenant may already be out of the unit;
she has not had the opportunity to check. The Tenant’s email was entered into
evidence.
 
3.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenant advised the Landlord she
would be vacating January 31 2022.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
January 31, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 31, 2022.




File Number: SOL-25806-21
 
 
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February
19, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 20, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit is not vacated on or before January 31, 2022, then starting February
1, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
5.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 1, 2022.
