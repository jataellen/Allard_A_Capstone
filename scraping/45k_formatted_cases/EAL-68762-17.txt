D.R.I.T.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict J.S.
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes and
has been persistently late in paying his rent. The Landlord also claimed NSF
cheque charges and related administration charges.
 
This
application was heard in Ottawa on December 12, 2017.
 
Only
the Landlord’s representative, A.L. M., attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
THE
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from August 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 23, 2017.
2.      The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending December 31, 2017 total $3,480.00.
3.      The
Landlord is entitled to $25.00 to reimburse the Landlord for charges the
Landlord incurred as a result of cheques tendered by or on behalf of the Tenant
which were returned NSF and related administration charges.
4.      The
Landlord incurred costs of $190.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
5.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $845.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
6.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 1, 2017 to
September 23, 2017 totalling $5.07.
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Landlord is unaware of any circumstances that
would justify refusing or delaying eviction. The Board’s standard voidable
eviction order shall issue. 
THE
APPLICATION FOR PERSISTENT LATE PAYMENT OF RENT
8.      The
Tenant has been persistently late paying the rent. Since June of 2017 the
tenant has never paid the rent on time. 
9.      The
tenancy is a month to month tenancy.
10.   The
Landlord asks that an order issue granting the Tenant conditional relief under
section 83 of the Act if the Tenant voids the eviction order for non-payment by
paying all of the rent arrears and costs currently owing. Given this submission
of the Landlord I find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from
eviction subject to  the conditions set out in this order pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
It is
ordered that:
THE
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated for non-payment of rent.  The Tenant must move out
of the rental unit on or before January 2, 2018.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,358.53*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to December 20, 2017 and the total charges
related to a NSF cheque tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant,
less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $27.78 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting December 21, 2017 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
December 31, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from January 1, 2018 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before January 2, 2018, then starting January 3,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 3,
2018.
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $3,695.00 if the payment is made on or before December 31, 2017, or
ii)       $4,540.00 if the payment is made on or before January 2, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after January 3, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
THE
APPLICATION FOR PERSISTENT LATE PAYMENT OF RENT
10.   If
the Tenant voids the eviction order above pursuant to paragraph 8 or 9 then:
(1)  The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord new rent on time and in full for the period
January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018.
(2)  If the
Tenant fails to make any one of the payments in accordance with paragraph 10(1)
of this order, the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to the
Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenant and requiring that the Tenant pay any new arrears, NSF
fees and related charges that became owing after December 31, 2017.
