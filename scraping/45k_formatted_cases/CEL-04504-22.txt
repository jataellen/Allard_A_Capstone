Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-04504-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


14 BAY SANDS DRIVE WASAGA BEACH ON L9Z1V1


 




Between:


Ontario Filter Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Dan Nightingale
  Shannon Bell


Tenants



 
 
 
Ontario Filter Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dan
Nightingale and Shannon
Bell (the 'Tenants') and for an order
to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on October 4,
2021 with respect to application CEL-02213-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants have not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenants
have failed to pay the rent arrears
and the lawful
January 2022 rent installment
in accordance with section 2 (a) and (b) of the order, on or before Jan 01,
2022
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order
required the Tenants
to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $4,620.00 for rent arrears
in Order CEL-02213-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $3,593.34 and
that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order
CEL-02213-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,975.00 from the
Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from September 1, 2019 to February 14, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order CEL-02213-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 25, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $1,572.82* (less any amount
paid to the Landlords after this application was filed on January 20, 2022). This amount represents the rent owing up to February
14, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $64.93
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 15,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
25, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 25, 2022, then starting
February 26, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 26, 2022.

The tenant has until February
24, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order
under s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by February 24, 2022
the order will be stayed and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on August 26, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
