Between:


Catherine Forbes


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Estate Of Richard Gooderham William Gooderham


Tenants



 
 
 
Catherine Forbes (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy because
Estate Of Richard Gooderham
and William Gooderham (the 'Tenants') because they abandoned the unit; and
because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in
the residential complex have wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the
premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenants to
compensate the Landlord for the damage.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653#
on January 26, 2022.
 
The Landlord, Catherine Forbes,
and the Landlord’s Agent, Christian Forbes attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Landlord
is seeking an order determining that the tenancy
is terminated because
the rental unit has been abandoned which was not supported by the
evidence.
2.     
The rental unit
is located on a land lease community and the Tenants own the mobile home on the
land. The Landlords acquired the land having purchased it from a previous
owner. There’s no written tenancy agreement. The application identifies two
Tenants. Sadly, one Tenant
died on or around September
1 2021 and other has not returned to the
mobile home or paid rent.
3.     By operation of law since there are
two tenants, the tenancy cannot be deemed terminated 30 days after the death of
Tenant, Richard, pursuant
to section 91 of the Act
because the other Tenant is alive. Since the other Tenant is alive, has not
given the Landlord a notice to terminate the tenancy, and he owns the mobile
home on the land,

albeit he may not occupy it as a principle residence, I’m not prepared to deem the tenancy terminated or abandoned.
4.    
The Landlord also filed a claim
for damage for costs expected to be incurred to remove the mobile home and pest treatment
under subsection 89(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). Section
89(1) of the Act states,
 
A landlord may apply to the Board for
an order requiring a tenant to pay reasonable costs that the landlord has
incurred or will incur for the repair of or, where repairing is not reasonable,
the replacement of damaged property, if the tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or a person whom the tenant
permits in the residential complex
wilfully or negligently causes undue damage
to the rental unit or the residential complex and the tenant is in
possession of the rental unit.
 
5.     This is also not an application filed
under Bill 184 for out of pocket
expenses. There was no evidence presented
to establish that the
Tenants willfully or negligently caused undue
damage to the land or other property of the Landlord.
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The application is
dismissed.
