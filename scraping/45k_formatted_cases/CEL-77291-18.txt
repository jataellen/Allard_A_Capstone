Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-77291-18
 
YA (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict MA and IA (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard in Mississauga on August 1, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s father and Power of Attorney for Property, MA and
the Tenant’s son, AM attended the hearing. The Landlord was represented by MW.
 
It is determined that:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid $10,000.00 of the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from March 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination.
 
2.     
The Tenants also owe the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
3.     
At the hearing, the Tenants paid the Landlord the rent of
$2,500.00 for the month of August 2018.
 
4.     
The total amount owing through August 31, 2018 is $10,190.00 ($10,000.00
+ $190.00).
 
5.     
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance
with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the
conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of
the Act.
 
6.     
The Landlord complied with Order CET-74655-18 and CEL-75019-18 by
paying to the Tenants the $8,860.00 rent abatement on June 29, 2018.
Unbelievably, the Tenants did not apply any portion of the payment towards the
arrears. The Tenant’s son stated that they put the money aside to make sure
they comply with the Order to pay rent on the first of the month from July 2018
to June 2019.
 
7.     
The Tenant’s son gave evidence that his parents are self-employed
but are currently sick and suffering from depression. He has a sister who works
and helps to pay the rent along with him and there are two other siblings who
attend university. The arrears of rent started in March 2018 after his sister
had surgery and his parents fell ill.
 
Section 82
 

At the hearing the Tenants raised a number
     of maintenance issues pursuant to section 82 of the Residential
     Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').

 

Several of the maintenance issues the
     Tenants attempted to raise have already been addressed in Order
     CET-74655-18/CEL-75019-18 issued on May 30, 2018. That Order awarded the
     Tenants a rent abatement of $8,860.00 and directs the Landlord to complete
     detailed repairs on or before September 30, 2018. The principle of re
     judicata means that once the Board as issued a final order about a
     specific maintenance issue, a party cannot ask the Board to issue another
     order for that same issue. For this reason, the complaints about the front
     porch steps and mold are not considered in this order. 

 

The Tenant’s son gave evidence that the
     air conditioning was not working and the technician sent by the Landlord
     identified a carbon monoxide leak during an inspection. He notified the
     Tenants about the leak but did not shut off the furnace.

 

The Tenants, alarmed by a possible
     carbon monoxide leak, contacted a heating/cooling company who reported on July 13, 2018 that the furnace had a crack; there
     was carbon monoxide spillage and the furnace and air conditioning needed
     replacement. The Tenants forwarded a copy of the report to the Landlord on
     July 16, 2018. 

 

The Tenants also contacted Enbridge who identified
     a potential safety issue and shut
     off the furnace on July 18, 2018. Enbridge
instructed
     the Landlord to correct the problem within 35 days. According to the
     Tenants, the furnace was replaced by the Landlord on July 25, 2018. 

 

The Landlords denied there was a carbon
     monoxide leak based on the report of his technician who installed a carbon
     monoxide detector on July 16, 2018. There was some back and forth argument
     between the parties on whether or not the furnace was a rental. That
     argument is irrelevant to my determination that there was a problem with
     both the air conditioning and the furnace. However, I am satisfied that
     the Landlord acted within a reasonable time to rectify the problem by
     having the furnace replaced within 12 days of been notified. As a result,
     there will be no abatement of rent awarded the Tenants. 

 

The Tenant’s son stated that they were
     forced to stay home from work on five different dates to let the
     Landlord’s contractors into the rental unit to carry out repairs but the
     contractors did not always show up and the Tenants lost wages from missing
     work on those days. The days mentioned by the Tenant’s son are July 16,
     18, 25 and 27 2018. 

 

The complaints of the Tenants regarding
     missing work are frivolous and appear to be an effort to either distract
     from the nonpayment of rent issue or are being made in hopes of getting a
     rent abatement. The evidence before the Board is that the Tenants do not
     currently work and even if they did, they are not obliged to be home when
     served with a notice of entry. The testimony of the parties and the text
     messages tendered as exhibits establish that on July 16 and 18, 2018 the
     Landlord’s technician and Enbridge visited to install the carbon monoxide
     detector and inspect the furnace on an emergency basis and the Tenants
     were home at the time. On July 27, 2018, the Tenants failed to confirm an
     appointment and the technicians did not show up as a result.

 

The Tenants email to the Landlord on
     July 22, 2018 informing the Landlord that all repairs must be suspended
     until after the hearing of this application is unreasonable given the fact
     that the Landlord must meet the deadline of September 30, 2018 for
     completion of all ordered repairs.  

 

The Tenant’s son complained that on July
     25, 2018, the Landlord droped off a dishwasher to be installed at a future
     date. Emails exchanges between the parties show that on that date the
     Landlord’s technicians installed a new fireplace, dehumidifier and air
     conditioning. 

 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Tenants shall pay the Landlord $10,190.00 as follows:
 
a.    $2,500.00
on or before August 20,2018                            (arrears)

on or before September 1, 2018                      (rent)
 
c.    $2,500.00
on or before September 20, 2018                   (arrears)

2.     
If the Tenants fail to make any of the payments by the deadlines
in accordance with this order, the outstanding balance of any arrears of rent
and costs to be paid by the Tenant to the Landlord pursuant to paragraph 1 of
this order, together with simple interest, calculated from the day after
default, at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding, shall become immediately
due and payable.
 
3.     
If the Tenants fail to make any one of the payments in paragraphs 1
of this order, in full and on time, the Landlord may apply under section 78 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, without notice to the Tenants for an order
terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants. The Landlord must make this
application no later than 30 days after the Tenants’ failure to make a payment.
As part of the application, the Landlord can also request an order for rent
that became owing after the date of this order and NSF cheque fees and related
administration charges.
