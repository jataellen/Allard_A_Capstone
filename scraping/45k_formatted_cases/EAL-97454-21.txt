Tenant



 
 
Eugene Gregory
James Myers (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to determine whether the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') applies.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 956 0593 7653# on January
12, 2022. The Landlord
and the Tenant represented by Linda Tranter, attended the hearing.
 
At the start of
the hearing Ms. Tranter requested an adjournment so that the Tenant’s partner
Brandon Myers, who is the Landlord’s son, could be served and participate as an
affected party. The Tenant lives with Brandon Myers. The Tenant testified that he is aware of the proceedings and
does not want to be involved. Considering
the fact, the Tenant testified that Brandon Myers was aware of the hearing,
chose not to attend, and does not want to be involved, adjourning this matter would not change the participants at the hearing.
The application shows that Brandon
has moved out of the unit and does not want to live with the Tenant any
longer. The request to adjourn to
serve Brandon Myers as an affected party was denied.
 
For the purposes of this order the parties
will be referred
to as landlord and tenant.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord
claims in his application, that the Tenant
moved into the rental unit, with his son Brandon, after they were evicted
from their apartment and needed a place to stay. The Landlord testified that he
wanted to help his son until he got back on his feet. Since the time they moved into the unit the Landlord testified
that the money that he was paid was only to cover the cost of hydro.
 
2.    
The Tenant testified that the property
taxes were also paid. The Landlord denies
this claim and there was no evidence to support this claim.
 
3.    
The Tenant’s
representative submits that there was an agreement that they would
$600.00 monthly
to occupy the rental unit. In the two
years since they moved in there have been no payments. It is the Tenant’s position
that because there were to be rental




File Number: EAL-97454-21
 
payments, this fact alone,
established a landlord
and tenant relationship. As such, the Tenant submits that the Act applies.
 
4.    
Section 202 of the Residential Tenancies Act requires the Board to ascertain the real
substance of the transaction.
 
5.    
Rent, under the Act,
cannot vary from month to month, as was the case in the cost of hydro and the
resulting payments to the Landlord. There
were none of the monthly rent payment made or expected in the two years the
Tenant and Brandon resided in the unit. This
is a father and son relationship. There is no evidence there
was an intention that the Landlord and his son create a
landlord and tenant relationship other than a conversation about paying to use
the unit. A conversation that never
concluded in rent being paid for the right to occupy. I accept the fact that Brandon and the Tenant needed a place to
move to and that the Landlord wanted to help his son get back on his feet.
 
6.    
I find, on a balance of
probabilities, that there was no intent to establish a landlord and tenant relationship. I find that the conversation about how much should be paid does not
create an implied or oral tenancy agree.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Act does not apply.
