Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-98986-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


26, 550 LEMAY STREET CORNWALL ON K6H7H2


 




Between:


Cornwall & Area
Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Catherine Spurr


Tenant



 
 
 
Cornwall &
Area Housing Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Catherine Spurr (the 'Tenant')
and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on
September 28, 2021 with respect to application EAL-95966-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order. The Landlord file an L4 application with the Board on November 18, 2021.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant has not met the
following condition specified in the order:
The Tenant failed to pay the arrears installment of $200.00 on November
1, 2021.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $4,757.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
EAL-95966-21. The amount
that is still owing from that
order is $4,557.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order EAL-95966-21 is cancelled.
