Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-99120-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


27, 955 DEBRA
AVENUE OTTAWA ON K2C0J5


 




Between:


Ottawa Community Housing


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Filsan
Sahal


Tenant



 
 
 
Ottawa Community
Housing (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Filsan Sahal (the 'Tenant')
and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes
because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by
the Board on November 17, 2020 with respect to application EAL-88655-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Board issued a consent order pertaining to
file number EAL-88655-20 on November
17, 2020 which required the Tenant to make regularly scheduled payments to the
Landlord that were to be applied against outstanding rental arrears. The agreement also required the Tenants
to continue making payments of lawful rent for each consecutive month in full, and on time for each corresponding month
beginning on December 1, 2020 through to June 1, 2022.
 
2.    
The agreement provided
that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain conditions specified in the order.
 
3.    
Pursuant to subsection
78(2) of the Act, an application made under section 78 requires the Landlord to
include with the application an affidavit setting out the conditions of the
settlement or order that had not been met and, how they had not been met. Section 78(4) of the Act also outlines the
information to be captured in the affidavit in circumstances when a Landlord
requests an order for payment, as has been the case in the subject application.
 
4.    
The content
of the declaration does not contain the statutorily required
information.
 
5.    
As the Landlord’s application does not meet the statutory requirements under subsection 78(4) of the Act, the
application is dismissed.
