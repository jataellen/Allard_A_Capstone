Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-21377-22
 
 



In the
  matter of:


936 MOUNT CASTLE
CRESCENT PICKERING ON L1V5J9


 




Between:


Krishna Menon Lakshmi Achuthan


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Mohaira Ali


Tenant



 
 
 
Krishna Menon and Lakshmi
Achuthan (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Mohaira
Ali (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the
Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the
order issued by the Board on May 12, 2021 with respect to application
TEL-12249-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlords could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following condition
specified in the order: The Tenant failed to pay $500.00 towards
the arrears, on or before January 1, 2022.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order
required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlords are entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $19,015.00 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order TEL-12249-20. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $5,515.00 and that amount
is included in this order. As a result, the previous order TEL-12249-20 is
cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:




File Number: TEL-21377-22
 
 
 
1.     Order TEL-12249-20 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 14, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords
$8,087.34*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to February 3, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $76.98
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 4, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing* on or before February 14, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 15,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 14, 2022, then starting February
15, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after February 15, 2022.

The tenant has until February 13, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by February 13, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of
