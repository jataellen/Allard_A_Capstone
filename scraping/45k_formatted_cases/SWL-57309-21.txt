Nancy Janet Carol Smith Sydney Yvonne Smith


Tenants




 
On November 18, 2021, Amiraco Properties Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Sydney Yvonne Smith and
Nancy Janet Carol Smith (the 'Tenants') and for
an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on July 22, 2021
with respect to application SWL-48778-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The order provided that the Landlord
could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenants have not met the following condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenants failed
to pay to the Landlord
$1,097.27 on or before November
1, 2021 towards rent.
 
3.       
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenants were ordered to pay
$2,480.35 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application
fee in Order SWL-48778-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $1,480.35
and that amount
is included in this
order. As a result, the previous
order SWL-48778-21 is cancelled.
 
5.       
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $995.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from September
8, 2017 to January 10, 2022.

It is ordered
that:
 
1.       
Order SWL-48778-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 21, 2022.
 
3.       
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $1,523.83*. This amount represents the rent owing up to November 30, 2021 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$36.07 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting December 1, 2021 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.       
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
21, 2022, the Tenants will
start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 21, 2022, then starting January
22, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 22, 2022.

The tenant has until January 20, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
