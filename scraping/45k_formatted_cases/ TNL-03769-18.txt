Order
under Section 21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-03769-18-RV2
 
 
 
Review Order
 
WS
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict AM
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was resolved by order TNL-03769-18 issued on August 31, 2018.
 
On September 13, 2018, the Tenant requested a review of the order.
 
The request for review was heard on September 26, 2018 and was
resolved by order TNL-03769-18-RV issued on October 5, 2018.
 
On October 29, 2018 the Tenant requested a review of the Review
Order issued on October 5, 2018.
 
A preliminary review of the review request was completed without a
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      S.
21.2 of the Statutory Powers Procedures Act permits the Board, to review
all or part of its own decision or order, if it considers it advisable and
if its rules made under section 25.1 deal with the matter.
 
2.      Rule
29.20 of the Board’s Rules of Practice provides that “The LTB shall accept only
one review request from a party, and shall not accept a subsequent request from
the same party to review the resulting review order or decision.”
 
 
3.      The
Tenant relies on the Divisional Court decision in Toronto Housing Co. v.
Sabrie  [2003] O.J. No. 652 in support of the proposition that the Board
has the power to hold a re-hearing of a review request where a procedural
defect violates principles of natural justice.
 
4.      In
the Sabrie case the tenant did not participate in the review hearing.
The Board proceeded on the mistaken belief that the tenant was arrested and in
custody, whereas in fact the tenant was hospitalized and unable to attend the
hearing. This resulted in a failure of natural justice as the tenant was not
able to participate in the review hearing.
 
5.      The
situation in this case is substantially different. The Tenant had a full
opportunity to participate in the review hearing, lead evidence and make
submissions. There has been no procedural defect that would justify a
“re-opening” or “re-hearing” of the review request.
 
6.      On
the basis of the submissions made in the request, I am not satisfied that there
is a serious error in the order or that a serious error occurred in the
proceedings.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
request to review order TNL-03769-18-RV issued on October 5, 2018 is denied.
The order is confirmed and remains unchanged.
