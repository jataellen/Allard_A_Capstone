Capreit Limited
Partnership (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Nirupa Nagalingam and Sudarakan Murugiah
(the 'Tenants') The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was scheduled by videoconference on October 8, 2021 at 8am.
Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Landlord
provided testimony through
their management office
employee Rehkha Chetri that
the tenant purposely or negligently drove their vehicle into and through a
garage door.
2.       
The Landlord
also presented video
evidence of the Tenant’s vehicle
causing damage to the buildings garage door which was
well maintained, in working order and normally opened via a key fob for which
the Tenant was issued a copy.

The Landlord presented an invoice for repairs which totalled $1854.05.
4.       
The Landlord testified that the Tenant
has thus far refused to acknowledge or pay
anything toward the repairs to the garage door.




 
5.       
 I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The Tenant
must pay the repair invoice
of $1854.05 within
20 days, failing
which the Landlord may apply
to the Board under section
78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, SO2006, c17 to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant.
2.       
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $48.67
per day for compensation
for the use of the unit from January 26, 2022 to the date they move out
of the unit.
3.       
If the Tenants do not pay the
Landlord the full amount of the repair
invoice owing on or
before January 25, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated
from January 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
4.       
If the repair invoice
is not paid and the unit
is not vacated on or before January
25, 2022, then starting
January 26, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
5.       
Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 26, 2022.
