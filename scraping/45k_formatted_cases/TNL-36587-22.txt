Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-36587-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


411, 2928 YONGE
STREET TORONTO ON M4N2K1


 




Between:


Capreit Limited Partnership


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Stephan Hashemi


Tenant



 
 
Capreit Limited Partnership (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Stephan
Hashemi (the 'Tenant')
and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the order
issued by the Board on January 24, 2022 with respect to
application TNL-33915-21.
 
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
 
2.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The original order was issued by the Board on January 24, 2022, and was amended on February 2, 2022. The amendment
renders the original order invalid.
 
 
3.     As the L4 application is based on Board order
TNL-33915-21 issued on January 24, 2022, which has subsequently been amended, the application based
on this order must
be denied.
 
 
4.     The Landlord may wish to file a new L4 application based on the amended order.




File Number: TNL-36587-22
 
It is
ordered that:
 
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
