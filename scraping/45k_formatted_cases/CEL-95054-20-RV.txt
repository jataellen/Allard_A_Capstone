Review Order
 
Amstar Pool I LP (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Heather
Kent and Theresa Kent (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe.
 
This application was resolved by order CEL-95054-20 issued on September
27, 2021. On October 20, 2021,
the Landlord requested a review of the order.
The request was heard by teleconference on January 7, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord’s legal
representative S. McArthur attended the hearing. As of 1:57pm, the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this
hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
Review
 
1.    
The Landlord’s request for a review
is based on the ground
of being not reasonably able to participate in the proceedings.
 
2.     The hearing that gave rise to the order under
review took place on May 31, 2021.
No representative of the Landlord was present.




 
3.    
In the review request the Landlord
submits that its representative, Mr. Anderson, had signed in to the hearings in the teleconference in which the hearing was conducted and was in the “opposed” hearing room when
this matter was called in the “unopposed” hearing room. The Landlord submits that
the Members presiding over the hearings
and the Moderators directing participants from one room to another were
aware that Mr. Anderson was present and representing the Landlord in this
matter.
 
4.     At the review hearing the Landlord’s legal
representative confirmed that the facts set out in the review request are true and
accurate.
 
5.     Based on the Landlord’s uncontested submissions, I
find that the Landlord was not reasonably able to participate in the proceedings. At the review hearing I granted the request for a review and the
Landlord’s application proceeded de novo.
 
L1 application
 
6.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from March 1, 2020 to May 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective March 26, 2020.
 
7.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on May 1, 2021. The Tenants
were in possession of the
rental unit when the application was filed.
 
8.     The monthly rent was $2,212.09.
 
9.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $2,178.00
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
10.  Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
1, 2020 to March 26, 2020.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order CEL-95054-20 issued
on September 24, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the
following:
 
2.    
The tenancy is terminated as of May 31, 2021, the date the Tenants
gave vacant possession of the
rental unit to the Landlord.
 
3.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlord $30,978.09*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to May 31, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.




 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
7, 2021, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 8, 2021 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
