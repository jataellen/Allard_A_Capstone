File Number: TNT-31750-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


APT 2, 10142
YONGE STREET RICHMOND HILL
  ON L4C1T6


 




Between:


Meghan Pagnello


Tenant




 


and


 




 


Lorne Block Investments Steve Vassos


Landlords



 
 
 
Meghan Pagnello (the 'Tenant') applied for an order determining that Steve Vassos
and Lorne Block Investments
(the 'Landlords') have collected or retained money illegally.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 17,
2022.
Only the Tenant attended the
hearing. As of 1:50 p.m., the Landlords was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     For the reasons
that follow I find that the Landlords failed to pay the Tenant {interest on last month's deposit, as required by
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). I further find that the
Landlords retained the Tenant's last month's rent deposit. This is prohibited
by the Act.
 
2.     The Tenant testified that she signed the lease on
August 23, 2019; the tenancy to began September 1, 2019. She provided the Landlords with the first
month rent and a last month
rent deposit in the amount of $1,100.00 each. On April 30, 2020 she vacated
with consent of the Landlord; she
paid the rent for April 2020. A new tenant moved in May 1, 2020.
 
3.    
The Tenant entered a book of documents into evidence supporting her testimony.
 
4.    
Section 106(10)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’) says a “landlord shall apply a rent deposit that a tenant
has paid to the landlord or to a former landlord in payment of the rent for the
last rent period before the tenancy terminates”.
 
5.    
Section 16(6) of the Act says (6)
a “landlord of a rental
unit shall pay interest to the
tenant annually on the amount of the rent deposit at a rate equal to the
guideline determined under section 120 that is in effect at the time payment
becomes due”.




 
 
 
6.    
Therefore, based on the
uncontested evidence and testimony before me I find that the Landlords retained
the last month rent deposit and did not apply it to the last month rent which
is contrary to the Act. I further find that the Landlords did not pay the Tenant
interest on the last month rent deposit
that they retained
which is also contrary to the Act.
 
 
7.     The Tenant is entitled to interest on her last month rent deposit from August 23, 2019, the date
it was given, to February 17 2022, the date the tenancy
ended, April 20, 2020, in the amount of $8.49 calculated as follows. This Board does not
have the jurisdiction to award interest on the last month rent deposit after
the tenancy terminated.
 
August 23, 2019 to August 22, 2020 2.2% X $1,100.00
+ $11.24
$11.24 ÷ 365 days/year
= $0.031 per diem
August 23, 2019 to April 30, 2020 = 274 days X $8.49
 
8.     As the Tenant
was successful in her application, she is also entitled to reimbursement of the application filing fee and an
order will issue for same.
 
9.     This order contains
all the reasons
for the decision within it. No further
reasons shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlords shall pay to the Tenant
the sum of $1,108.49. This amount represents
$8.49 for interest on the last month's rent deposit and $1,100.00 for the last month's rent deposit.
 
2.     The Landlords shall also pay to the Tenant $53.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     The total amount
the Landlords owe to the Tenant is $1,169.98.
 
4.     If the Landlords do not pay the Tenant the full amount
owing by March 8, 2022, the Landlords will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 9, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
 
5.     The Tenant has the right,
at any time, to collect
the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
