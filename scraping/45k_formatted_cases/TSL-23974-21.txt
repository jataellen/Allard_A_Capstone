and


 




 


 
Emery Farnady


 
Tenant



 
 
Metcap Living Management Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict Emery Farnady
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Sara Mathew attended the hearing. As of 2:39 p.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective August
25, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,149.55.
 
4.     The Tenant paid $2,249.60 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord sent a
letter to the Tenant on the necessity of a repayment agreement. The Landlord’s
attempts at negotiating a repayment agreement were unsuccessful.
 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,149.55 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent
deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021 to August
25, 2021.
 
8.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including
the impact of COVID-19 on the




File Number: TSL-23974-21
 
parties and whether the
Landlord attempted to negotiate a
repayment agreement with the Tenant and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until February 4, 2022 pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. Additional time given to the Tenant to pay
the outstanding amount.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before February 4, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $2,484.68*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 12, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay
to the Landlord $37.79 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 13, 2022 to the date the
Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 4, 2022, the
Tenant will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from February 5, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 4, 2022, then starting February
5, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction
may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
February 5, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$4,482.82 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$5,632.37 if the payment
is made on or before
February 4, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after
February 5, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once
during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
