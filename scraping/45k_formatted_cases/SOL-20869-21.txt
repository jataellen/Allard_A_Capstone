In the matter
of:


707, 30 CONGRESS CRESCENT HAMILTON ON L8K5H8


 




Between:


Cityhousing Hamilton Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Scott Anderson


Tenant



 
 
 
Cityhousing Hamilton Corporation
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Scott Anderson
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard via
videoconference on July 6, 2021 at 1:00
p.m.
 
Only the
Landlord, represented by Katherine MacIntyre, a licensed Paralegal, attended
the hearing. The Tenant,
Scott Anderson, was not present
or represented at the hearing though being properly served with
the Notice of Hearing by the Board.
The hearing proceeded without
the Tenants at 4:29 p.m.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
October 1, 2019 to July 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October
31, 2019.
 
2.     The Tenant was in possession of the rental
unit when the application was
filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
housing charge is
$234.00
 
4.     The Landlord does not hold a last month’s rent deposit.
 
5.     As of the hearing date, the Tenant owed the Landlord, $1,824.00
including arrears of rent
to July 31, 2021 of $1,638.00 and the application fee of $186.00. Since the
hearing, another five rental periods have begun, and five more month’s rent
have become due. Therefore, the amount in this order includes August 2021,
September 2021, October 2021, November 2021,
December 2021 and January 2022’s
rent. If the Tenant has paid
the Landlord August 2021, September 2021, October 2021, November 2021,




 
December
2021 and January 2022’s rent and /or made any payments to the Landlord since the hearing,
the Landlord shall deduct those payments from the
amount owing in this order.
 
6.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before
February 5, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$5,580.73*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 25, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $7.69 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 26, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before
February 5, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 6, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 5, 2022, then starting February
6, 2022,
 
7.     the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 6, 2022.
 
9.     If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
 
i)                   
$3,783.75 if the payment
is made on or before January 31, 2022,
or
ii)                 
$4,047.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 5, 2022**.
 
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.




 
10.  The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 6, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
