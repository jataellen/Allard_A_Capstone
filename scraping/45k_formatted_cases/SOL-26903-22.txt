Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26903-22
 



In the matter
of:


204, 288 GRAYS
ROAD HAMILTON ON L8E1V5


 




Between:


Jeremy Vandermarel


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Asma Fatima


Tenant



 
 
 
Jeremy Vandermarel (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Asma Fatima
(the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant
owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the
order issued by the Board on January 18, 2022 with respect to application
SOL-24829-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant has not met
the following condition specified in the order: The Tenant failed
to pay the lawful monthly
rent in full, on or before February
1, 2022.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $2,251.80 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
SOL-24829-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $1,951.80
and that amount is included in this order. As a result,
the previous order
SOL-24829-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from February 1, 2022 to February 28, 2022.
 
6.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,050.00
from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.




File Number: SOL-26903-22
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 6, 2017 to February 18, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SOL-24829-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before March 1, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$1,332.83*. This amount represents the rent owing up to February 18, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $35.78 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 19, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March 1, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 2, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 1, 2022, then starting
March 2, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 2, 2022.
