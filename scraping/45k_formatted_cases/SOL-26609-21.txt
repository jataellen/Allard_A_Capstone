COURT

Kyle Da Silva Teresa Da Silva


Tenants




 
On November 24, 2021, Kendale (11-21)
Div. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Teresa Da Silva and
Kyle Da Silva (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent
they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order
issued by the Board on November 23, 2021 with respect to application
SOL-23149-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenants have not met the following condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenants failed to pay to the Landlord $348.92
on or before November 1, 2021 towards arrears
of rent. The Tenants only paid $340.00.
This was a breach
of the previous consent
order.
 
3.       
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenants were ordered
to pay $1,395.68 for rent arrears in the previous
consent order. The Landlord
had waived $500.00 NSF cheque charges and the filing fee of
$186.00; however, if the Tenants defaulted
on the payment plan the new total
owing would increase to $2,081.68. The amount that is still owing from
that order is now
$1,741.68 and that amount
is included in this order.
As a result, the previous
order SOL- 23149-21 is
cancelled.
 
5.       
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $987.48 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.




 
6.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenants for the period from March 1, 2020 to January 17, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
Order SOL-23149-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move
out of the rental unit on or before January
28, 2022 (standard 11 days from the
issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $735.44*.
This amount represents the rent owing up to November 30, 2021 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$32.95 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting December 1, 2021 to the date the
Tenants actually move out of the rental unit or get evicted.
 
5.       
If the Tenants do not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing*
on or before January 28, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest.
This will be simple
interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at 2.00% annually
on the balance outstanding.
 
6.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after January 29, 2022.

The tenant has until January 27, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 27, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on July 29, 2022 if the order has not been
filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that
has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
