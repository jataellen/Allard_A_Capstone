20 S.Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict R.S. and D.B. (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on
October 31, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the second-named
Tenant above attended the hearing. The Landlord was represented by S.H..
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent they were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2018 to
October 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective August 25, 2018.
2.     
The Tenants paid $3,455.00
after the application was filed.
3.     
The arrears of rent owing
for the period ending October 31, 2018 totalled $974.59 as of the date of
hearing before me. 
4.     
The Landlord incurred costs
of $190.00 for filing the application and is entitled to reimbursement of those
costs.
5.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,476.53 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2018 to August 25, 2018
totalling $17.25.
7.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. 
8.     
The Board has already issued
an order terminating this tenancy for persistent late payment. The Landlord
indicates it intends to enforce that order through the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) on or after November 11, 2018. That order is contained in Board file TEL-92736-18. The Tenant says she is prepared to move but wants more
time. As I explained to the Tenant at the hearing, at
the hearing of this application I do not have the power to alter the Board’s
order in Board file TEL-92736-18. The Tenant indicated she had seen
Tenant Duty Counsel and been given a referral but the Board’s records show no
review of Board order TEL-92736-18 has yet been filed. 
9.     
Given the above, there is no point in giving the
Tenants additional time to pay the rent arrears owing. The tenancy is lost
regardless of when the Tenants pay the Landlord the outstanding amount. At the
hearing I indicated I would issue the standard order which is set out below. 
10.   I would note however for the record, that Board order TEL-92736-18
includes per diem compensation for the period starting September 1, 2018.
Obviously that period overlaps with the period covered here. The Landlord is
not entitled to collect rent for the same period twice, so it is the
expectation of the Board that the Landlord will enforce Board order
TEL-92736-18 only to the extent of obtaining eviction and collecting its costs
of filing that application. But with respect to rent and daily compensation,
the Landlord should only enforce this order. 
11.   This order contains all of the reasons for the
decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.
It is ordered that:
1.     
Unless the Tenants void the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before December
2, 2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $536.33*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to November 21, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes
on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $48.54 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting November 22, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before December 2, 2018, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
December 3, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before December 2, 2018, then starting December 3, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after December 3, 2018.
8.     
If the Tenants wish to void
this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust:
i)        $2,641.12 if the payment is made on or before November 30, 2018, or
ii)       $4,117.65 if the payment is made on or before December 2, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after December 3,
2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
10.   The Landlord shall take steps to ensure that in
enforcing this order and Board order TEL-92736-18 the
Landlord shall not recover from the Tenants the rent due
for the period commencing September 1, 2018 more than once.

rental unit is located.
