Tenants



 
Anita Twerdochlib and Wendy
Andrade (the 'Tenants') filed a motion to set aside order CEL- 00636-21 that issued on October 21, 2021 because,
before the eviction
order was enforced, the Tenants paid the amount required under subsection 74(11) of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') to void the order.
 
This motion to void was heard by videoconference on January 21, 2022.
 
One of the Tenants, Wendy
Andrade, and the Landlord attended the hearing. The Tenant was able to speak with Tenant Duty Counsel
prior to the commencement of the hearing.
The Tenant confirmed she was
also representing the second Tenant, Anita Twerdochlib.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     Based on the parties’ submissions, I was satisfied, and so find, that the Tenants have not
previously made a motion under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside an
eviction order during the period of the Tenants' tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenants have paid a total of $24,186.00 to the Landlord
and this amount
is the amount required under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to void the eviction order.
 
3.     In the motion to void, the Tenants
declared they paid $12,000.00 by cheque on August 4, 2021 and then they paid $12,186.00 by
cheque on January 1, 2022. This was confirmed by the Landlord. The parties were in disagreement
concerning an attempted $2,400.00 payment in September 2021, but it was evident
to me that the amount required to void the order in September 2021 would have been $2,586.00 for the balance of arrears, plus
$2,400.00 in respect of rent due on September 1, 2021 for September 2021.
 
4.     To be clear, the $24,186.00 paid brings the Tenants to a zero balance up to January
31, 2022.
 
5.     The Landlord has paid $329.40
under the Administration of Justice Act for the purpose of having the Sheriff enforce the
Landlord's eviction order dated October 21, 2021 and this




 
amount is non-refundable. I find that the Landlord
is entitled to recover the Sheriff’s fee incurred and I refer to the statutory
requirement under subsection 74(15) of the Act.
 
6.    
The Tenant present requested that
due to circumstances, she be given until March 21, 2022, to pay the $329.40 so
that the order can be voided. I
indicated this would be possible, but erroneously indicated that the Landlord would have to let the Board know if
the Sheriff’s fee has been paid. Instead, the Act is quite clear about how
and where the Sheriff’s fee is to be paid, and how the eviction order is to be
voided.
 
7.     As given statutorily under subsection 74(15) of the
Act, I shall order the Tenants pay the Sheriff’s fee amount of $329.40 into the Board on
or before March 21, 2022, and if that is paid in full and on time to the Board,
then an employee of the Board shall issue a notice under subsection 74(16) of
the Act to acknowledge the eviction order is therefore void. The Board will then promptly pay out
the $329.40 to the Landlord directly.
If the Tenants do not pay the $329.40 into the Board in full and on
time, the motion to void shall not succeed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order CEL-00636-21 issued
on October 21, 2021 is void and cannot be enforced by the
Landlord if the condition set out in paragraph 2 of this order is met.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay $329.40 to the Board on or before March
21, 2022. This amount
represents the non-refundable amount the Landlord paid to enforce the eviction
order.
 
3.     If the Tenants pay the amount set out in paragraph 2
on or before March 21, 2022, then an employee of the Board will issue
a notice acknowledging that the eviction order issued on October 21, 2021 related to arrears is void.
 
4.     The amount of $329.40 paid into the Board by the Tenants
shall be paid out to the Landlord.
