Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-19458-19
 











 
 

DI (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict SWB (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes (L1 application). 
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant has been persistently late
in paying the rent (L2 application). 
 
This application was heard in Toronto on January 9,
2020.
 
The Landlord’s representative, BR
and (JR), an occupant of the unit, attended the hearing on behalf of the Tenant.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from August 1, 2019 to
January 31, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective August 23, 2019.
2.     
The monthly rent as of the
date of the hearing is $1,126.53.
3.     
The Tenant paid $6,117.00 after
the application was filed.
4.     
The Tenant is currently out
of the country and will not return until March 31, 2020. 
5.     
There was no dispute that
the Tenant owes the amount of $332.86, which represents the arrears of rent to
January 31, 2020 ($142.86) and the application filing fee ($190.00).
6.     
There was also no dispute
that the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the rent. 
7.     
The Landlord requested a
standard order for the L1 application and for the Tenant to pay the rent when
due commencing February 1, 2020.
8.     
JR requested until January
31, 2020 to pay the arrears and indicated that the rent will be paid on time,
starting February 2020.
9.     
As I stated at the hearing, with
respect to the L1 application, I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until January 31, 2020 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of
the Act.
10.  
Also as stated, with respect
to the L2 application, I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction
subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection
83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
11.  
At the hearing, I explained
section 78 of the Act and that the Tenant must comply with the order to pay the
rent when due. I was satisfied that JR, on behalf of the Tenant, understood the
consequences of not complying with the order.
It is ordered that:
 
L1 application:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before January
31, 2020.
2.     
As of the date of this
order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the Landlord is
entitled to by $1,646.00*.
3.     
However, the Landlord is authorized
to offset the following amounts from the amount the Landlord owes the Tenant:
$37.04 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 15,
2020 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit, and $190.00 for the cost of
filing the application.
4.     
The Landlord or the Tenant
shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
5.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2020, then starting February 1, 2020, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
6.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 1, 2020.
7.     
If, the Tenant wishes to
void the portion of the order for rent arrears, and continue the tenancy, the
Tenant must pay, on or before January 31, 2020, the amount of $332.86** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, and this order for eviction based on rent
arrears will be void.  This means that the tenancy would not be terminated for
arrears of rent, and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this payment is
not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order pertaining
to rent arrears, if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 1, 2020 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
L2 application:
9.     
Commencing February 1, 2020 and for a period of 12 consecutive months
(February 2020 to January 2021), the Tenant shall pay the monthly rent on or
before the first day of each month.
 
10.  
If the Tenant fails to make
any of the payments under paragraph 9, above, in full and on time, the Landlord
may apply under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, (the 'Act') within 30 days of the breach, without notice to the Tenant,
for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant.
