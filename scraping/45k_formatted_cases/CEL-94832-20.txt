In the matter
of:


14 PENETANG STREET BARRIE ON L4M1V4


 




Between:


Berczy Street Properties


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Erin Lees


Tenant



 
 
 
Berczy Street
Properties (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Erin Lees ( the “Tenant’)
because the Landlord
intends to do major repairs
or renovations to the
rental unit The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Potential Parties remained in
the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 14, 2021. Only the Landlord
attended the hearing. As of 10:19 a.m. the Tenant was not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
as it appears from the Certificate of Service.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
At the outset of the
hearing Melissa Banks was identified as a support person for the Tenant, not an
occupant or tenant of the rental unit. Melissa
Banks was not named on the Notice of Termination (form N13). The application was amended to remove Melissa Banks as a party.
 
2.    
The application is
based on a Notice of Termination (form ‘N13’) served on the Tenant March 20, 2020 with a termination date of July 31, 2020. The notice
was served pursuant to 50 (1)(c) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006, (the “Act’) because the Landlord requires the rental
unit to be vacated in order to do major repairs or renovations to the rental
unit.
 
3.    
I am satisfied that the
Landlord has obtained the necessary permits for this work. The work is required to repair ongoing
leaks originating in the Tenant’s
unit (kitchen) and is
set out in the notice.
 
4.    
The Landlord
is aware of the Tenant’s
right to return to the unit following
the repairs, providing the
Tenant informs the Landlord of their intent to do so, in writing, prior to
terminating the tenancy.




 
 
 
5.    
The current
monthly rent is
$1,060.90.
 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,050.00 from the Potential
Parties and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Potential
Parties for the period from June 18, 2020 to July 31, 2020
 
8.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated, as of January
15, 2022. The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before January 15, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $17,154.57 (less any payments made to the Landlord after
October 14, 2021) , which represents compensation for the use of the unit
from August 1, 2020 to January 4, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Potential Parties shall also pay to the Landlord
$34.88 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from January 5, 2022 to the date they
move out of the unit.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before January 15, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 16, 2022.
 
 
January 4, 2022
