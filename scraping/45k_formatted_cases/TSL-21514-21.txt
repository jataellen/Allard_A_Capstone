Walmer
Developments (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Isaiah Markus Coleman,
Keith Coleman and Nigisti Wright
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the
rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 1, 2021. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Bryan Rubin, attended the hearing.
As of 10:01 a.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period
from November 1, 2020 to May 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective March 23, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
vacated the rental
unit on May 31, 2021. The Tenants were in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,710.00.
 
4.    
The Tenants
have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,710.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
