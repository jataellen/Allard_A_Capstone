Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-18270-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


HOUSE, 1387
COLBORNE STREET E BRANTFORD ON N3T5M1


 




Between:


Mehar Ahmed


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Allana Simmons Garrison O'grady John O Grady


Tenants



 
 
 
Mehar Ahmed (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict John O Grady, Garrison
O'grady and Allana
Simmons (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on June 15,
2021.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s Legal representative, Sibthey
Hasnain, the Tenants’
Legal Representative, Carmen Dawdi, and the Tenants attended the
hearing.
 
Preliminary Issues:
 
1.     The Tenants raised some preliminary issues at the
start of the hearing. The Tenants argued that the address used in the
application does not have the correct municipality. The Tenants argued that the
correct address should be Kingsville. The Landlord replied stating that the
same address was previously used in other applications initiated by the
parties. The Landlord also submitted that the municipality appearing on google
maps for this address is Brantford. I accepted the Landlord’s arguments and
find that the address used in this application is accurate. The Tenants used the same
address when filing their own application with the Board. The municipality listed on google maps for this address
is Brantford.
 
2.     The Tenants argued that this property is a Motel and
not covered under the Act. The Landlord replied stating that this same argument
was raised in another A1 application that he filed with the Board in
SOT-16853-20 and it was ruled that this is not a Motel, therefore this property is subject to the Act. I reviewed
the order dated October 29, 2020 in file
SOT-16853-20 and agree with the detail analysis of member Rozehnal that this
property is subject to the Act. I find that the Act applies to the subject property
in this application.




 
3.    
The Tenants argued that the
Landlord did not reference the other 2 applications before the Board in this
application. There is no obligation on the Landlord to reference every
application before Board unless they are related
and joined. There is a process to request
that applications be joined before the Board. If the Tenants are taking the position that the
applications should have been joined, it was their responsibility to follow the
Board’s process and request that they be joined. Simply stating that the
Landlord did not reference the other applications before the Board is not a
contravention of the Board’s process.
 
Determinations:
 
4.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from May 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective November 25, 2020.
 
5.     The Tenants argued that the amount of $21,186.00
claimed by the Landlord on the date of the hearing
is incorrect, because
it does not account for the payment
of $2,780.00 paid into the Board, which the Landlord
did not include in the update sheet. The Tenants provided receipts to that
effect, but they are unsigned. I am not prepared to accept these unsigned
receipts as proof of payment. If the Tenants can obtain an updated proof of
payment from the Board for the alleged payment amount, then this amount should
be deducted from the amount stated in this order.
 
6.     The Tenants argued that the Landlord turned off vital
services in the winter period. From September 14, 2020 to November 2, 2020, the
Tenants submitted that the Landlord turned off the hydro. The Landlord denied this accusation and stated that he did
not have the means to pay the utility bill because the Tenants are not paying the rent. The Tenants rejected the Landlord’s
explanation and stated that the Landlord earns $2000.00 daily and therefore has
the means to pay. There was no evidence provided to substantiate the
proposition that the Landlord earns $2000.00 daily and even if that evidence
was provided it would have to be considered with the expenses that the Landlord
has to truly determine if the Landlord did have the ability to make these
utility payments.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. After considering the
position of both parties and reviewing their evidence, I find that this tenancy
is not viable. The Tenants are not able to afford this rental unit and
consequently, the arrears of rent keep increasing. There is no mutual benefit
to the parties to extend this tenancy because I do not see how the Tenants will manage to clear the outstanding arrears
within a reasonable period to salvage the tenancy.
Extending this tenancy will unfairly
prejudice the Landlord. I see no reason to deny the eviction order requested by
the Landlord.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of
the rental unit on or before
February 12, 2022.




 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $31,588.44*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 1, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$49.32 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 2, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before
February 12, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 13, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 12, 2022, then starting
February 13, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 13, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 12, 2022, the Tenants pay
the amount of $33,186.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction
will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 13, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
