Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44514-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


105, 1284 DIANE STREET SUDBURY ON P3A4H6


 




Between:


Bocan Ent. Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Cody Grigsby


Tenant



 
 
 
Bocan Ent. Inc (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Cody Grigsby (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 3, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Jovana Nikolic,
attended the hearing. As of 4:11 p.m., the Tenant
was not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay
for the period from May 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective October
30, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent for
the unit is $1,062.60.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.     The
Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,050.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from February 15, 2021
to October 30, 2021.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the parties and whether
the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 22, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4,174.95*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
11, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $34.52
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 12, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
22, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 23, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 22, 2022, then starting
February 23, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 23, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 22, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $6,076.20** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain
in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 23, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
