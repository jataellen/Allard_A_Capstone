Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57650-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


19, 786
SHELBORNE STREET LONDON ON
  N5Z4Y6


 




Between:


M.f. Arnsby
Property Management Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Sandra Mashar


Tenant



 
 
 
M.f. Arnsby Property Management
Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sandra Mashar (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on April
12, 2021 with respect to application SWL-43332-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant
if the Tenant did not meet certain
condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The tenant failed to pay rent from the month of January
1, 2022 in full and on or before
the first of the month. The Tenant
failed to pay $288.00 to arrears in full on or before January 15, 2022.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $5,184.00 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
SWL-43332-20. The amount that is still owing from that order is $3,177.00
and that amount is included
in this order. As a result,
the previous order
SWL-43332-20 is cancelled.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SWL-43332-20 is cancelled.




File Number: SWL-57650-22
 
 
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 20, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $3,117.00* (less
any amounts paid since this application was filed on January 24, 2022). This
amount represents the rent owing up to January
31, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $28.77
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 1, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 20, 2022, then starting
February 21, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 21, 2022.
