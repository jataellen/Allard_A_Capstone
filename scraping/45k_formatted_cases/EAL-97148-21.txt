Tenant




 


Shawn Trottier


 



 
 
 
Mahaluxmy
Arunthavarajah and Anoja Arunthavarajah (the 'Landlords') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict Shawn Trottier (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on November 23, 2021 and February 2, 2022. The Landlord, Anoja Arunthavarajah and the
Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period from July 1, 2020 to October 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlords
served a Notice of Termination effective August 17, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant moved out of the rental
unit on October 9, 2021 but the Landlord was not informed until
October 20, 2021 when the keys to the rental
unit was returned. The Tenant was in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     At the commencement of the tenancy,
the monthly rent was $2,000.00. While the Landlord stated that she agreed to reduce
the rent to $1,850.00 for the period from July 2020 to October 2020 only, and that the Tenant was expected to pay the full amount
when he was able to, the Tenant stated that the rent was reduced
indefinitely. The Tenant presented a series of text messages to support his
claim.
 
4.    
Based on the text message from the
Landlord on August 27, 2020, the Tenant was informed that the Landlords could
only reduce the rent to $1,850.00; on August 30, 2020, the Landlord requested September
2020 rent of $1850.00; and on January 5, 2021, she requested a payment of $1,850.00. Therefore, I find that the lawful monthly rent was
$1,850.00 for the period
from July 2020 to October
2021 when the tenancy terminated.

5.    
The Tenant paid $24,200.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.     The Landlords collected
a rent deposit of $2,000.00
from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlords.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from November 30, 2019.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of October 20, 2021, the
date the Tenant gave vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $2,730.91*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to October 20,
2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing* on or before March 22, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from March 23, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
