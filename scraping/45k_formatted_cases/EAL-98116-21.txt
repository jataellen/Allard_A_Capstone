Between:


Krista Cox

Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Crystal Collison
  Gary Allingham


Tenants



 
 
 
Krista Cox and Mohamed
Abdelrahman (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Gary Allingham and Crystal Collison (the 'Tenants') because they, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex
have wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlords has also applied for an order requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlords for the damage.
The Landlords also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 956 0593 7653#
on January 26, 2022.
Only the Landlord, Mohamed Abderlrahman attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord filed the application on October 12, 2021 and stated the Tenant and their
occupants vacated by October 31, 2021. Based
on the uncontested testimony from the
Landlord, I find the Tenants were in possession of the rental unit when the
application was filed.
 
N5 Notice:
 
2.    
The Landlord’s application for eviction based
on an N5 Notice issued
under section 62 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') is moot
because the Tenants vacated the rental unit.
 
Damage:
 
3.     Subsection 89(1) of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
states,




 
A landlord
may apply to the Board for an order requiring a tenant to pay reasonable costs that the landlord has incurred or will incur for the
repair of or, where repairing is not reasonable, the replacement of damaged
property, if the tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person whom
the tenant permits in the residential complex wilfully or negligently causes
undue damage to the rental unit or the residential complex and the tenant is in
possession of the rental unit.
 
4.    
Section 89 of the Act is intended
to allow a landlord to apply for the cost of repairing or replacing actual
physical damage to the rental
unit or residential complex. It is not enough
for a landlord to simply rely on his list of damaged property on the L2
application and expect the Board to accept it on its face. The Landlord must adduce sufficient
evidence
to satisfy me that the Tenants
committed the act of damaging the Landlord’s property either with intention or by being careless. The Landlord also has the onus of proving that the
damage was beyond normal wear and tear and distinguish between damage caused by normal living and damage because
the useful life of the property expired.
 
5.     I find the Tenants have wilfully and negligently caused
undue damage to the rental
unit by breaking the hand
railing leading to the basement in half. The Tenant negligently damaged a small area of the wall where
they removed the baseboard when they
installed doors in the living room and wilfully damaged the wall having left holes in the drywall after the doors were removed. These damages were supported by the
Landlord’s testimony and photographs.
 
6.     The Landlord has repaired the damaged wall and replaced
the railing but failed to present receipts for actual costs
incurred nor did he have an estimate of the what was paid for material and
labour. This was available and expected evidence that was not provided. The quote
for $4,800.00 did not include
a breakdown of material or costs by item and was
insufficient to support the Landlord’s claim.
 
7.     The Landlord showed
photographs of the carpet that was dirty that depicted small liquid
drip like stain(s) in two small areas and a couple of other areas that appeared
lightly soiled. The Landlord suspects the stains are from pet feces. There are around seven small areas where
spots are depicted which are small and faint.
The photographs did not show
fraying, rips or deep stains on the carpet to support replacement costs of
$5,200.00.The carpet throughout
the unit including the dark spot on the brown carpet of the stairwell landing
was cleaned after the Tenants vacated and before the Landlord’s new tenants moved in. I am not satisfied the carpet
was not reasonably repaired when it
was cleaned. The Landlord guessed
cost was $300.00
to clean the carpet. The Landlord
received an invoice for the carpet cleaning but did not provided to the Board
nor was actual costs presented through testimony.
 
8.     Since the Landlord
established there was undue damage caused to the railing,
the Landlord is entitled to the cost of the application.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
 
1.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlords $186.00
for the cost of the application fee




 
2.    
If the Tenants do not pay the
Landlords the full amount owing on or before February 12, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 13, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
