Emilija
Davidovic (the 'Tenant') applied for an order determining that Ranee Management
(the 'Landlord') substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenant or by a
member of the Tenant's household.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on October 26, 2021.
 
The Tenant
and the Landlords
Legal Representative Llana Glickman attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant
filed an application alleging that the Landlord had substantially interfered with reasonable enjoyment by failing to adequately investigate
and resolve noise complaints.
 
2.    
The Tenant testified that the Tenant works from home, teaching
online, and needs quiet
space. In April 2020 a new Tenant had
moved into the residential complex into a unit above the Tenant. At the time the noise started it continued
unabated even after numerous complaints to the building management. The noise was described as someone moving
and banging in the unit above her to the point that within her own unit, the entire ceiling and sometimes
the entire apartment is shaking and vibrating. There were several recordings
provided to the Board.
 
3.    
The Tenant explained that due to the COVID lockdown she was working
from home teaching in film
and production and that the noise was impacting her work.
 
4.    
It was uncontested that
the Tenant had complained to the superintendent and to the Property Management
company but to no avail. The Tenant indicated that she felt that management was only trying
to deflect the issue as they could not determine
where the noise was coming
from.




File Number: TST-15889-20
 
5.    
As a result, the Tenant gave notice in early May 2020 seeking
to be let out of the tenancy at the end of June 2020. The Tenant vacated the rental unit on June
25, 2020.
 
6.    
The Landlord’s
representative indicated that this was not 60 days notice, so it had to be end
of July 2020. The representative
indicated that the landlord does try to rent out the unit when given short notice, they have a waiting list, but in this instance
were not able to
re-rent the unit.
 
7.    
I am satisfied that the Landlord
or the Landlord's superintendent substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit. By failing
to take the noise complaints seriously and by failing to
adequately investigate and take action to resolve them, the Landlord permitted
the noise to continue unabated and to disrupt the work from home conditions of
the Tenant.
 
8.    
The Tenant is seeking
an order that the tenancy is terminated on June 30, 2020. In consideration of the failure of the
Landlord to act on the complaints and the ongoing nature of them and the impact on the Tenant’s employment and reasonable enjoyment
of the rental unit during COVID, I find this to be a reasonable request.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated as of June 30, 2020.
 
2.    
The Landlord
shall pay to the Tenant
$390.00 which is the reasonable out of pocket expenses the Tenant has incurred
for moving expenses.
 
3.    
The Landlord
shall refund the Tenant one month’s rent for the month of July 2020, in the amount of $1,350.00.
 
4.    
The total amount the Landlord owes is $1,740.00
 
5.    
The Landlord
shall pay the Tenant the full amount owing by January 16, 2022.
 
6.    
If the Landlord does
not pay the Tenant the full amount owing by January 16, 2022, the Tenant will owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from January
17, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
