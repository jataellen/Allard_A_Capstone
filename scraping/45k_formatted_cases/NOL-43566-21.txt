and


 




 


Devin Nicholson Monica Patterson


Tenants



 
 
 
Terry Leclair
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Devin
Nicholson and Monica Patterson (the 'Tenants') because
the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of
residential occupation (L2 application).
 
Terry Leclair
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Devin
Nicholson and Monica Patterson (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe (L1 application).
 
This application was heard by video conference on November 22,
2021.
 
At 1:24 pm, the Landlord and the Landlord’s Daughter Christine LeClair
attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations and Reasons:
 
1.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
2.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1350.00.
 
N12 Notice,
L2 Application
 
3.    
The Landlord
served the Tenants
with a Notice to Terminate a Tenancy at the End of the Term for Landlord’s Own Use (the ‘N12
notice’), on July 5, 2021. The N12 gave a termination date of September 30, 2021. The N12 notice
indicates the Landlord requires the
rental unit for personal residential use.
 
4.     Pursuant
to section 48 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’):




 
(1)   A landlord may, by notice,
terminate a tenancy if the landlord in good faith requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation by,
 
(a)    
the landlord;
…
 
(2)  
The date for termination specified in the notice shall be at least 60 days after the
notice is given and shall be the day a period of the tenancy ends or, where the
tenancy is for a fixed term, the end of the term.
 
5.     Section 48.1 of the Act requires
a landlord who has served
an N12 notice to give the
tenant compensation in the amount of one month of rent.
 
6.    
Section 55.1 of the Act requires
a landlord who is obligated to give compensation to a tenant under s.48.1 to pay that compensation no later than the termination date in the N12 notice.
 
7.    
Subsection 83(4) of the Act provides that “The Board shall not issue an eviction
order in a proceeding
regarding termination of a tenancy for the purposes of residential occupation
… until the landlord has complied with section 48.1, 52, 54 or 55, as the case may be.”
 
8.    
On the date of the
hearing, the Landlord confirmed that compensation as per the requirements of the Act had not been paid to the Tenants. Accordingly, pursuant to subs. 83(4) of the Act, this application
must be dismissed.
 
 
N4 Notice,
L1 Application
 
9.    
The Landlord
served the Tenants
with an N4 Notice to End Tenancy
for Non-payment of Rent (N4
Notice) on July 5, 2021. The date of
termination is July 19, 2021.
 
10.  The Landlord is seeking daily compensation and the application filing fee of $201.00.
 
11.  The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from June 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served the N4 notice.
 
12. 
The Landlord
testified that he is of failing health,
with challenges walking
and climbing stairs and as
such requires the rental unit.
 
13.  When asked about
the Tenants, both the Landlord
and the Landlord’s Daughter said they were surprised that that they were
not at the hearing as the Landlord received an email from the Tenants about the
hearing. No circumstances were
provided for consideration as reason to delay or deny eviction.
 
14. 
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of
the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find
that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
15. 
This order contains all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s L2 application is dismissed.
 
2.     The Landlord’s L1 application is granted.
 
3.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 24, 2022.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$9,492.93, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 13, 2022.
 
5.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $44.38 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 14, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
6.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing*
on or before January 24, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 25,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
7.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 24, 2022, then starting January
25, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 25, 2022.
 
9.    
If, on or before
January 24, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $10,200.00 to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
10.  The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January 25, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
