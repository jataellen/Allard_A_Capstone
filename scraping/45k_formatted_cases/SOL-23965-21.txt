Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-23965-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


133 LYONS AVENUE WELLAND ON L3B1M3


 




Between:


Matteo De Luca


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Cory Morice Sabrina
Greaves


Tenants



 
 
 
Matteo De Luca (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Sabrina Greaves and Cory Morice (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 25, 2022.
The Landlord and the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective August 17, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,400.00.
 
4.     The Landlord incurred
costs of $186.00
for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
 
5.     The Landlord is not holding
a rent deposit.
 
6.     The rent arrears
outstanding to January
31, 2022 total
$8,400.00.
 
7.     The Tenants have not paid any rent since the application was filed.




 
8.    
At the hearing, the Landlord
submitted that he has attempted to contact the Tenants in order to either
collect the rent that was owing or to be able to work out a payment plan with them. The Landlord
added that the Tenants has been uncooperative and is seeking a standard order from the Board
in order to have the rent paid or the Tenants evicted.
 
9.     The Tenants raised the following issue pursuant to
section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'): a broken
front door due to a break and enter on December 19, 2021, which resulted in all
of their Christmas presents and various other items being taken. Since then,
the Tenants submitted that they have not felt safe in the rental unit as the front door has not been properly
repaired. The Tenants
added that they have been living elsewhere while
waiting for the repair to occur.
 
10.  The Landlord admitted
to not having properly fixed the front door due to his being out of
town. Now that the Landlord is back, he did assure the Board that this issue
would be looked after right away and that the Tenants would be able to safely
return very soon.
 
11.  I find that the Tenants
are entitled to a rent abatement of $1,400.00. This is the amount of one month’s rent and is warranted given
that the Tenants have not had use of the rental unit for at least our weeks.
 
12.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in this matter in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenants,
and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction
until February 28, 2022 pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act. This time will allow both parties the opportunity to work out
their differences, if possible.
 
13.  This order contains
all of the reasons in this matter
and no further reasons will be given.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $7,115.51*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 1, 2022 and less the amount of the
abatement/rebate the Landlord owes the Tenants.
 
3.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$46.03 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 2, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
28, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.




 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 28, 2022, the Tenants pay
the amount of $8,586.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that
subsection on or after March 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once
during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
