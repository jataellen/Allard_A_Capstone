Tenants




 
 
2495513 Ontario Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Douglas Niven
and Melissa Niven (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
20, 2022. The Landlord's Legal Representative, Irina Karyankina, and the Tenants attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination (the ‘N4’) effective October 2, 2021.
 
2.     The N4 states that the Tenants did not pay the rent
for August 2021. At the hearing, the parties agreed that the Tenants paid the
rent for August 2021. Therefore, I find the N4 is defective because
it is confusing. The Landlord
was given the option of proceeding for an
order for arrears only and not eviction. However, the Landlord elected to
withdraw the application.
 
3.     The application having been withdrawn, the Board’s file is closed.
