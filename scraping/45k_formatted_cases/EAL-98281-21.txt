Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-98281-21



In the
  matter of:


7, 102 JOSEPH
STREET KINGSTON ON K7K2H7


 




Between:


Dain Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Brian Vachon


 
Tenant



 
 
Dain Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Brian Vachon (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 1, 2022. The Landlord's Legal Representative, Lorrie McCullough,
and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period
from September 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective October 10, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,229.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,215.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     The Tenant testified that they have been struggling
financially due to an egregious debt
with payday loans and that hydro bills and other bills were accumulating and
difficult to pay off. The Tenant also indicated that their pension
had been cut in half and proposed that they pay off the arrears
over a period of 3 years starting
in March. The Tenant also testified that they have a small
child to care for and have been overwhelmed with a separate legal matter in
Superior Court that has been consuming most of his time and has deteriorated
his mental health.
 
7.    
The Landlord was opposed
to the Tenants request for a payment
plan. Mainly because the Tenant did not provide any
evidence supporting their ability to make any payments and based on the length
of time the Tenant has not paid any rent.




File Number: EAL-98281-21
 
8.    
Based on the evidence before me, I
am not satisfied that a payment plan is viable considering that the Tenant
has failed to provide evidence
to support that an extended payment plan would be
appropriate. And based on the lack of payment at all from the Tenant to show
good faith to the Landlord.
 
9.    
The Landlord also did not provide
evidence regarding further
prejudice that would be
caused by delaying the enforcement of the order to allow the Tenant time to tap
into resources for funding to satisfy the arrears or in order to locate
alternative housing.
 
10.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until March 15, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of
the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 15, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$5,553.00*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 16, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $39.95 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 17, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
March 15, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
March 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 15, 2022, then starting
March 16, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 16, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)  $7,504.00 if the payment is made on or before
February 28, 2022, or
ii)  $8,733.00 if the payment is made on or before March 15, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March




File Number: EAL-98281-21
 
16, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenant is only
entitled to make this
motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
