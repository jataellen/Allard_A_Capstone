On November 23, 2021, Laurie
Mackie and Robert Mackie (the 'Landlords') applied in this L3 application for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ashely
Langille (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant entered into an agreement to terminate the tenancy
 
Determinations:
 
1. The Landlords
and the Tenant
signed an N11 Agreement to End the Tenancy form with
effective termination date December 31, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The tenancy between the
Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 15, 2022 (standard 11 days from the
issuance date of this order).
 
2.       
Since the Landlords applied
for this order before the termination date in the N11 had expired, the cost of the application
filing fee will not be imposed on the Tenant.
 
3.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlords may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
4.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after January 16, 2022.
