Tenant



 
 
Review Order
 
On November 15,
2021, Paul Giddings (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Paul Venditti
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant entered
into an agreement to
terminate the tenancy.
 
That application was resolved by order SOL-26067-21 issued on December
7, 2021. On January 11, 2022
Paul Venditti (the 'Tenant') requested a review of the order.
A preliminary review of the review request
was completed without
a hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order issued December
7, 2021 is an Ex-Parte
Order stemming from the Landlord’s L3 Application.
 
2.     In response to the Ex-Parte Order, the
Tenant filed a request to review indicating that he was not reasonably able to participate in the proceeding. The Tenant also asserts that the
Landlord coerced him into agreeing to terminate the tenancy.
 
3.    
The order in question
was issued without a hearing and in accordance with the process set out in
section 77 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). Because
this Ex- Parte process proceeds without a hearing and without the affected
tenant’s participation, there is no basis for the Tenant’s
assertion that he was not reasonably able to participate.
 
4.    
I have reviewed the Ex-Parte Order and find that it was properly
issued based on the
Landlord’s L3 Application.




File Number: SOL-26067-21
 
5.    
This does not mean
that the Tenant is without the potential
for recourse. If the Tenant would like to dispute
the Ex-Parte Order he should filed with the Board a motion to set aside and a request to extend the time
to file a motion to set aside.
 
6.    
On the basis of the submissions made in the request, I am not satisfied that there is a
serious error in the order or that a serious error occurred in the proceedings.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The request
to review order
SOL-26067-21 issued on December 7, 2021 is denied. The order is confirmed and remains
unchanged.
