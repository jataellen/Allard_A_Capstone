Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006











 
 
 

TTMI (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict AA (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Mississauga on October
2, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s Agent, MNZ, and the
Tenant attended the hearing.
 
At the hearing the Tenant raised
the following issues pursuant to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'):  no operational laundry facility, no air
conditioning, broken toilet, flood, mold, parking issues, illegal entries, loss
of use of yard, threats and harassment.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Landlord is amended to
reflect the named Landlord in the written Residential Tenancy Agreement
(Agreement) signed and dated by the parties on August 30, 2017.
2.     
The Tenant did not dispute
the rent arrears of $6,750.00 owing to October 31, 2018 as claimed by the
Landlord in this application.  The Tenant requested a set off of the rent
arrears owing and a further full rent abatement from September 1, 2017 to
October 31, 2018 due to her issues raised pursuant to section 82 of the Act. 
3.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from May 1, 2018 to
October 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective July 17, 2018.
4.     
The Landlords collected a
rent deposit of $1,350.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlords.
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 1, 2017 to July 17, 2018.
6.     
The Tenant has paid
$1,350.00 to the Board in trust since the application was filed. **.
7.     
The Tenant raised issues
regarding whether or not the Landlord breached section 20 of the Act because of
the disrepair of the washer, dryer, air conditioner, and toilet.  Also because
there was a flood in April 2018 which was not addressed properly and led to
mold growth in the unit.  
8.     
Subsection 20(1) of the Act
states the following: 
 
A landlord is responsible for providing and
maintaining a residential complex, including the rental units in it, in a good
state of repair and fit for habitation and for complying with health, safety,
housing and maintenance standards.
 
9.     
For the reasons stated
below, I am satisfied that the Landlord breached section 20 of the Act.  There
was no dispute that the washer, dryer, air conditioner and toilet were in
disrepair at various times during the tenancy and that there was surface mold
in the laundry room.  I am also satisfied that the Landlord’s Agent illegally
entered the rental unit and substantially interfered with the Tenant’s
reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit by preventing access to the back yard.
 
10.  
Subsection 20(1) of the Act
does not contain an element of fault. Therefore, regardless of the reasons why
a landlord is unable to provide a rental unit in a good state of repair and fit
for habitation, if they are unable to do so, they will generally be found to be
in breach of their obligations under the Act.
 
11.  
The Ontario Court of Appeal in Onyskiw v. CJM Property
Management Ltd. (2016 ONCA 477) determined that landlord is not automatically in breach of their
maintenance obligations as soon as a problem arises and a contextual approach is necessary in
determining whether or not a landlord has breached their maintenance
obligations under section 20 of the Act. That approach involves a consideration
of the “entirety of the factual situation” before determining that a landlord
is in breach of their maintenance obligations.
12.  
I have taken into account
the entirety of the factual situation including the condition of the rental
unit, the scope of the work and the time involved in resolving the issue. In
this context, I find that the Landlord breached their maintenance obligations
under section 20 of the Act.  Despite the fact that the rental unit was newly
built prior to the Tenant moving in, there was no dispute that these issues
were in disrepair. 
13.  
The laundry facility in the
Tenant’s unit had issues from day one.  The washer flooded on the Tenant’s
first use.  According to the Tenant, the washer was not replaced until December
2017.  At that time the Landlord also installed a new dryer.  However, the
dryer was not hooked up to an exhaust vent.  When the dryer was finally hooked
up to an exhaust vent in April 2018, the exhaust was connected to the stove
exhaust fan.  There was no dispute that the City Inspector attended the rental
unit and issued an order for the Landlord to comply and properly ensure that
the dryer vents to the exterior.  This was completed in August 2018.
14.  
The Tenant stated that she
was unable to use the laundry facility in her unit because of these issues at
various times.  The Landlord’s Agent submitted that prior to December 2017 when
he installed new appliances in the Tenant’s unit, the Tenant had access to the
upper level laundry facility.   This was not disputed by the Tenant.  However,
there was no dispute that as of approximately March 2018, the Tenant did not
have access to the upper unit’s laundry room.  
15.  
Given that the dryer in the
Tenant’s unit was not operational for the period of March 2018 to August 2018
when the Tenant did not have access to another dryer, I find that the Tenant is
entitled to a lump sum abatement of rent totalling $120.00, representing $20.00
per month.  The Tenant stated that not having use of a laundry facilities was
inconvenient, however she did not provide any other details such as costs or
travel incurred as a result.  The rent abatement is appropriate in these
circumstances given that this amount is comparable to the reasonable costs of
using a dryer at a laundry mat and because the use of a dryer was agreed upon
by parties in the tenancy.
16.  
Although there was no
dispute that the washer was also replaced due to an initial flood from the
original machine.  I find it more likely than not that the Tenant had use of
the upper laundry facilities while the washer was broken down between September
2017 and December 2017.  The Tenant provided no evidence regarding any
inconvenience during this period of time. As well, after the initial flood from
the new washer in December 2017, most likely due to poor installation, there
were no further reports of the machine not being operational. 
17.  
The Landlord’s Agent did not
ignore the issue with the disrepair of the air conditioning unit when the
Tenant reported it in June 2018.  He immediately contacted a technician to
address the problem.  However, there were still a number of visits by various
technicians until a final repair was completed at the end of August 2018.  The
air conditioning unit was only fully operational at that time.  
18.  
Therefore, I find that the
Tenant is entitled to a lump sum abatement of rent totalling $300.00 is more
appropriate in these circumstances representing $100.00 for each month she
lived without air conditioning, namely June, July and August 2018.  The months
are during the summer season where air conditioning would normally be utilized. 

19.  
The Landlord’s Agent was out
of the country in May 2018 when the toilet stopped working at the rental unit. 
The Tenant first reported the issue on May 2, 2018.  The Landlord’s Agent’s son
was able to assist the Tenant three days later and permitted her access to the
upper unit for use of a bathroom.  The toilet was repaired after a part was
obtained on May 13, 2018.  
20.  
There is only one bathroom
in the Tenant’s unit.  The Tenant loss use of a toilet for approximately four
days, three days awaiting a response from the Landlord’s Agent and one further
day when the Landlord’s Agent locked access to the upper unit the day prior to
the toilet being repaired.
21.  
 Therefore, I find that the
Tenant is entitled to a lump sum abatement of $200.00, representing $50.00 for
each day the Tenant did not have use of a toilet in her unit.  
22.  
There was no dispute that a
flood occurred in the rental unit in April 2018.  The Landlord’s Agent
immediately responded by attending the rental unit. He stated that the sub-pump
had been disconnected and once turned on, the water drained. 
23.  
Since there were no further
issues with water flooding in this respect, I am satisfied that the issue with
the sub-pump was the cause.  In this circumstance, I am not satisfied that the
Landlord breached section 20 of the Act.  The Landlord’s Agent responded
immediately and effectively to the issue.  
24.  
Other than a baseboard along
one wall of the unit affected by this flood being in need of repair, the Tenant
provided no photos of repair or damages elsewhere.  The baseboard area was
repaired by the Landlord’s Agent but the Tenant disagreed with how the repair
was completed.  The Tenant’s issue with the repair was simply cosmetic.  The
Landlord’s Agent responded reasonably to the issue and removed and replaced the
baseboard.  
25.  
While I understand that the
Tenant was not pleased with the repair or the fact that Landlord’s Agent’s used
her belongings after the flood, such as her mop, towels and/or other linens,
these issues are very minor in nature and do not amount to substantial
interference.  Parties have a duty to mitigate their losses in accordance with
section 16 of the Act.  I find it very unlikely that the Tenant’s linens and
mop could not be cleaned and reused. 
26.  
There was surface mold
growth on the wall in the furnace room.  The Tenant stated that water had been
pooling in this area which she believed to be the cause of the mold. The
Landlord’s Agent acknowledged that the drain for the air conditioning unit had
been clogged with dirt and debris, and once cleaned the water drained
properly.  The Tenant alleged that the mold on this wall affected the area on
the other side of the wall where she stored some personal belongings. 
According to her, the items in her storage bins smelled like mold. 
27.  
The mold in the furnace room
was never addressed by the Landlord. In the last few months, the Tenant has
advised the Landlord’s Agent via text messages regarding this issue. The Tenant
remarked on the look and smell of the area affected.  
28.  
The area affected by the
surface mold is one wall behind the furnace, in a room which also houses the
washer and dryer used by the Tenant. Other than the odour, I am not satisfied
that the Tenant’s ability to use the laundry room was impacted.  Therefore, I
find that the Tenant is entitled to a lump sum rent abatement of $200.00 for
this issue.
29.  
The evidence before me was
insufficient to find that the Tenant’s storage was affected as a result of the
mold issue.  There was no dispute that the Tenant utilized the Landlord’s
garage for storage and only had to obtain her own storage facilities when she
was instructed to remove her belongings from the garage this past June.  Also,
the Tenant had no photos of her storage items allegedly removed from the
storage area behind the furnace room because of the mold on the wall. 
30.  
There was no dispute that
the Tenant initially had use of the backyard at the residential complex. When
the Landlord’s Agent was fed up with the Tenant failing to clean up after her
dogs, as of June 12, 2018, he prohibited the Tenant from using the yard.  
31.  
Based on the uncontested
evidence before me I am satisfied that the Landlord’s Agent substantially
interfered with the Tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex by
prohibiting use of the yard as of June 12, 2018.  
32.  
Therefore, I find that the
Tenant is entitled to a lump sum abatement of rent totalling $200.00 for the
period of June 12, 2018 to current.  I find this amount to be appropriate in
these circumstances given that this period of time was during the summer season
when the Tenant would have fully utilized the yard for family gatherings,
barbeques and other outdoor activities which normally take place outside. 
33.  
Based on the evidence before
me, I find it more likely than not that the Landlord’s Agent unlawfully entered
the rental unit.  I am satisfied that it has only been in recent months where
the Landlord’s Agent has provided a written notice stating a date, reasonable
timeframe, and reason for entry into the Tenant’s unit.  A number of notices
were submitted by the Landlord’s Agent into evidence, however the ones that are
dated are between August 17, 2018 and September 14, 2018 only.  Therefore, prior
to this timeframe, I find it more likely than not that the Landlord’s Agent
would simply text or call the Tenant to advise of any entries into the unit.
34.  
The Tenant’s evidence
regarding the Landlord’s Agent’s entries was vague, however she did recall that
if there was a notice it would be given the day prior and state an entry
timeframe of the next day between 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m.  She further recalled
at least three occasions where the Landlord’s Agent entered to show the unit
with the tenants from the upper unit with proper sufficient notice. 
35.  
Therefore, I find that the
Tenant is entitled to a rent abatement of $150.00, representing $50.00 for each
illegal entry.  The Tenant was very upset at the Landlord’s Agent entering her
unit and on one occasion her son was sleeping in the living area and woke up to
a number of people standing over him. 
36.  
I am not satisfied that the
Tenant’s issues with parking amounted to a substantial interference by the
Landlord.  The Tenant acknowledged that she was aware upon renting the unit
that parking is available only in tandem in a single driveway.  There were no
issues in the first few months of the tenancy simply due to the fact that the
upper unit was vacant and the Tenant was the only one parking a car in the
driveway.  The Tenant agreed to this parking arrangement knowing that the upper
unit would eventually be rented to other tenants who would also park a vehicle
in the driveway.
37.  
The Tenant and her witness
described an incident in the driveway between the Landlord’s Agent and the
Tenant’s witness, wherein the Landlord’s Agent yelled at the witness and called
him an outsider.   There was no dispute that the Landlord opposed anyone else
living with the Tenant in the rental unit and was upset that the witness was
regularly there.   I am not satisfied that this one encounter with the
Landlord’s Agent rose to the level of substantial interference with the
Tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit. 
38.  
For the reasons above the
Tenant is entitled to an abatement of rent totaling $1,170.00.
39.  
The Tenant is actively
seeking out new accommodations for her and her two children.  She hopes to have
secured a new rental unit for November 1, 2018.  
40.  
The Landlord is requesting
payment of the rent arrears or eviction. 
41.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until October 31, 2018
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.  The Tenant will not have secured a
new place prior to this timeframe, one month’s rent will be paid out from the
Board’s trust account and the Landlord is holding a last month’s rent deposit. 
This delay is not unreasonable.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before October
31, 2018.The amount of $1,350.00 plus accrued interest shall be paid out to the
Landlord.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlords $3,113.61*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to October 5, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit and less the amount of the abatement the
Landlord owes the Tenant.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $44.38 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
October 6, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before October 31, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
November 1, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before October 31, 2018, then starting November 1, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction
may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after November 1, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before October 31,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $5,770.00** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after November 1, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
 
10.  
The Board shall pay to the Landlord the amount
of $1,350.00 together with any accrued interest. **
