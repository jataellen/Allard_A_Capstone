Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-25319-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


D,
  24 BOND STREET BRANTFORD ON N3R4G5


 




Between:


Joseph Giannetti


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Peter Ladd


Tenant



 
 
Joseph Giannetti (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Peter Ladd (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 1, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative,
Kimberly Holleran, attended the hearing. As of 10:43 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from August 12, 2021 to February 11, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective October 10, 2021.
 
2.     The application is amended to correct the street name of the rental unit to Bond Street.
 
3.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
4.     The monthly rent is $1,450.00.
 
5.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
6.    
The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 18, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$8,600.51*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 7, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$47.67 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 8, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 18, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 18, 2022, then starting February
19, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 19, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust $9,839.40 if the payment is
made on or before February 18, 2022**. If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if the Tenant pays the amount
required under that subsection on or after February 19, 2022 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to
make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
