Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-04548-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


136,
  77 DIANA AVENUE BRANTFORD ON N3T0R6


 




Between:


Shilpi Dinesh Mandal Prakash Kumar


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Brighton Charles
  Joshua Coates


Tenants



 
 
 
On February 1, 2022, Shilpi
Dinesh Mandal and Prakash Kumar (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Joshua
Coates and Brighton
Charles (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe
because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by
the Board on September 10, 2021 with respect to application HOL-09893-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlords could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants have not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenants did not pay $600.00 arrears
on or before January 15, 2022. The Tenants did not pay $1750.00 rent on or before
January 15, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the
Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlords are entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $12,436.00 for rent arrears
and the costs related
to the Landlord's application
fee in Order HOL-09893-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is
$11,086.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous
order HOL-09893-21 is cancelled.




 
5.    
Since the date of the
order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from August 15, 2021
to February 14, 2022.
 
6.    
The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,750.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from November 10, 2019 to February 16, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order HOL-09893-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 27, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords
$16,295.64*. This amount
represents the rent owing up to February 14, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe
on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $57.53 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 15, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before February
27, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 28, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 27, 2022, then starting
February 28, 2022, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after February 28, 2022.
