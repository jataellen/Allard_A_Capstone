Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24094-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


3, 100 WATERLOO AVENUE GUELPH ON N1H3H8


 




Between:


Jasbir Singh Harkanwal Kaur


Landlords




 


and


 




 


Roman, Jesse Luke


Tenant



 
Jasbir Singh and Harkanwal
Kaur (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Roman, Jesse Luke (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on February 8, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal
Representative, Kiran Kaur, attended the hearing. As of 10:42 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from July 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022.
Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination
effective July 26, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $500.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
 
6.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order
as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 25, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $3,764.72*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 14, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords
$16.44 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 15, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing* on or before February 25, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 26,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 25, 2022, then starting February
26, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 26, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 25, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $4,186.00** to the Landlords or to the Board in trust,
this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if the Tenant pays the amount
required under that subsection on or after February 26, 2022 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlords.
