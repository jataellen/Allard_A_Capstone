In the matter
of:


APT 1, 103 SIXTH STREET MIDLAND ON L4R3X3


 




Between:


Jim Hawke Michele

Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Linda Moreau


Tenant



 
 
 
Jim Hawke and Michele
Hawke (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Linda Moreau (the 'Tenant')
because the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation. The Landlords also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 4, 2021.
 
The Landlord Jim Hawke,
the Landlord Representative J. Cramer and the Tenant
Linda Moreau attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlords served the Tenant
with an N12 notice of termination seeking
termination of the tenancy
for the purpose of residential occupation by the Landlords’ child.
 
2.     The termination date in the Form N12 was October 31,
2021. The Landlord has met the 60 day notice requirement of s.48(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”), and I am satisfied that the Landlord has met the
declaration requirement of s.72(1)(b) of the Act and the compensation requirement
under s. 48.1 of the Act.
 
3.     The Landlord must also satisfy the Board that they
require, in good faith, possession of the rental unit for the
purpose of residential occupation for a period
of at least one year by their child. In Salter v.
Beljinac, 2001 CanLII 40231 (ON SCDC), the court clarified the Landlord’s good faith
requirement as follows:
 
In my view,
s.51(1) charges the finder of fact with the task of determining whether the
landlord’s professed intent to want to reclaim the unit for a family member is
genuine, that is, the notice to terminate
the tenancy is made in good faith. The




 
alternative finding of fact
would be that the landlord does not have a genuine intent to reclaim the unit
for the purpose of residential occupation by a family member.
 
4.     I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the
Landlords’ son intends to move into the rental unit for a period of at least
one year. Section 83 of the Act,
however, requires that the Board have
regard to all the circumstances to determine if it would be appropriate to delay or deny eviction in
the form of section 83 relief.
 
5.     Having regard to all the circumstances as outlined
below, I am exercising my discretion under s.83(1)(a) of the Act to refuse to
grant eviction.
 
6.    
I find the testimonies of both the
Landlord and the Tenant to be genuine. The Landlord’s son recently sold his
principle residence, with the intention of moving into another property that he owns (the “Reno Home”). The Reno Home is an older property underdoing
significant renovations, with an estimated completion date of 12-14 months
before it is liveable. Given the size
and location of the rental unit, the Landlord’s son seeks to move into the
rental unit with his family during the renovations (approximately 12-14 months)
and subsequently move to the Reno Home once those renovations are completed.
 
7.     On the other hand, the Tenant has lived in the rental
unit for approximately 24 years and her current rent is $955.57.  She states she is concerned about where she
will go if evicted and that she is “ill over this”. She further testified that after working
all her life, she is now retired. Given the rental climate, she fears she
will not be able to afford another place and will be left homeless if evicted. She testified she currently lives with her
adult son so as to assist him with his own precarious financial situation.
 
8.     I do not find that it would
be unfair to refuse eviction
given the circumstances, and the fact that the Tenant’s housing outlook
appears to be more limited that the housing options of the Landlord’s son. In
this regard, the Tenant testified that the Landlord’s son works in real estate
and has other housing options, in addition to living with the Landlord. She
submits there is a small, vacant apartment in the current residential complex. While I appreciate the Landlord’s
submission that the 1-bedroom, apartment is not ideal for the Landlords son’s
family of three, it does provide atleast another housing option while the Reno
Home is undergoing renovations.
 
9.     Section 73.1 of the Act provides that if the Board
refuses to grant an eviction order but where compensation has been given under
section 48.1, the Board may order that the tenant pay back the compensation to
the landlord. I will make such an order.




 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlords' application is dismissed.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $955.57,
which was given by the Landlords as the
required compensation under s. 48.1.
