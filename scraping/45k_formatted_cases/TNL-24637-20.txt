Avi Kraman Teresa Baetiong


Tenants




 
 
 
Sina Akhavan (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Teresa Baetiong and Avi Kraman (the 'Tenants') because they, another occupant
of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the
residential complex have substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on December 17, 2020.
 
Only the Landlord attended the
hearing. As of 3:01 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing,
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have failed to pay their portion of the water bill as per their lease agreement. The amount of unpaid water bill
the Tenants are responsible to pay is $3,086.85 as of July 12, 2021. The
Tenants also changed the locks of the rental unit without permission from the
Landlord.
 
2.    
This conduct substantially interferes with a lawful right,
privilege, or interest of the Landlord.
 
3.     The Landlord provided
a copy of the lease agreement, which states that the Tenants
are responsible to pay 2/3 of the utilities, mainly the water bill.
 
4.     At the hearing,
the Landlord confirmed
that they are not seeking
an eviction, but rather an order directing the Tenants to pay
their outstanding portion of the water bill.
 
5.     Based on the uncontested evidence that I received from
the Landlord at the hearing, I find that the Tenants substantially interfered with a lawful right, privilege and interest of

the Landlord by failing
to pay 2/3 of the water bill,
which amounted to $3,086.85 as of July 12, 2021.
