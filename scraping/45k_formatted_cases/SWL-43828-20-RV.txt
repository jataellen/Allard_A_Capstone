Review Order
 
1912802 Ontario
Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order requiring Gia Ruscica and Rylan Burm (the 'Tenants') to pay the rent that
they owe.
 
This application was resolved by order SWL-43828-20 issued on July 15, 2021. On August 212, 2021, the Landlord
requested a review of the order.
The request was heard in Passcode: 496 319 095# on
November 30, 2021. The Landlord, Carolline Chevalier attended the hearing.
The Landlord
was required to provide a copy of the tenancy
agreement as post hearing
submission which was not received.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
This application was adjourned twice before on December 1, 2020
and February 4, 2021. The Landlord
claims that she did not receive the Notice of Hearing and also provided medical
note from her physician that she couldn’t have attended the hearing on June 10,
2021 because of illness.
 
2.    
The Board mailed out
the Notices for the multiple hearings to the same address the Landlord provided
on her review request and none of that mail was returned as undelivered by
Canada Post. With respect to the medical note from her physician dated August
3, 2021, the Landlord is licensed and indicated that she’s filed many
applications before the Board,
therefore she’s familiar
with Board processes and could have asked an authorized representative to attend on
her behalf and didn’t.




File Number: SWL-43828-20
 
3.    
The Landlord
filed an L9 application after the Tenants
failed to pay rent on March 2020 and April 2020 and she testified she
found the unit abandoned on April 30, 2021.
 
4.    
The Representative
stated the Tenants gave illegal notice to terminate the tenancy. The Landlord
failed to provide details about the termination notice the Tenants as requested
including when the notice was provided and what date they told the Landlord they’d were vacating the unit. When I asked the Landlord about providing written communication that was exchanged about
the illegal notice, she stated she had none.When asked about the details on the
lease, the Landlord stated she did not have it before her. A copy of the tenancy agreement was requested as a post hearing submission which was not provided.
Instead after the hearing, the Board received a request from the Landlord to withdraw the Review.
 
5.    
The Landlord did not
investigate whether the Tenants vacated after they provided their notice of termination. The Landlord provided
no reasonable explanation why they choose to
wait until April 30, 2021 to find the unit abandoned when the Tenant’s stopped
paying rent after February 2020. The
Board also sent a Notice of Hearing to the Tenants on January 14, 2021 and again on April 6, 2021 and both of those
Notices were returned by Canada Post as undelivered/as moved. The evidence
suggests the Tenants
vacated well before April 30,
2021.
 
6.    
I find the Landlord
choose to turn a blind
eye to the obvious. Since it’s up to the Landlord
to provide enough evidence to support their claim, I am not prepared to accept
the Landlord’s evidence the Tenant’s vacated on April 30, 2021 when the
Landlord ought to have known they vacated well before April 30, 2021. Given the
lack of details provided about the tenancy agreement and the Notice of
Termination the Tenants gave the Landlord, the L9 application is dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.    
Order SWL-43828-20 issued on July 15, 2021 is cancelled
and replaced by the following:
 
2.    
The Landlord’s L9 application is dismissed.
