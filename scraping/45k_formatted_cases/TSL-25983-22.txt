Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-25983-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


BASEMENT, 22 GLENEITA STREET SW
  SCARBOROUGH ON M1M0B5


 




Between:


Siddiqur Zahid


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kaylee Freitas


Tenant



 
 
 
Siddiqur Zahid (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kaylee Freitas (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant
owes because the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the
Board on December 9, 2021 with respect to application HOL-11484-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition(s) specified in the order: The
Tenant failed to pay the lawful monthly
rent in full, on or before December 1, 2021. The Tenant failed to pay $400.00 towards
the arrears, on or before December 20, 2021.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the
payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $9,936.00 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
HOL-11484-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $9,936.00
and that amount is included
in this order. As a result,
the previous order
HOL-11484-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed
to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from December 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,900.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from November 25, 2020
to January 20, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order HOL-11484-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 31, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$11,183.50*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to January 20, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $62.47
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 21, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
31, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022, then starting February
1, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 1, 2022.

The tenant has until January 30, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 30, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on August 1, 2022 if the order
has not been filed on or before
this date with the
Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
