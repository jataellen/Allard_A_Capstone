Review Order
 
M
C and G P A (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict C S (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This
application was resolved by order TSL-08283-19 issued on December 9, 2019.
 
On December 20, 2019, the Tenant requested a review of the order
and that the order be stayed until the request to review the order is resolved.
 
On December 23, 2019, interim order TSL-08283-19-IN was issued,
staying the order issued on December 9, 2019.
 
The request was heard in Toronto on January 24, 2020.
 
The Landlord, M C; the Landlords’ representative, K M; and the
Tenant attended the hearing. 
 
Determinations:
 
The
request to review is granted 
1.      These
proceedings stem from an L1 Application for non-payment of rent. The Board
heard the merits of the application on December 3, 2019. Only the Landlords’
representative attended that hearing; the Tenant did not attend. The hearing
Member issued a “standard order” on December 9, 2019, which gave the Tenant 11
days to pay the full amount owing, failing which the Landlord could pursue
eviction. 
2.      The
Tenant filed a review, in which he claims that he was not reasonably able to
participate in the hearing on December 3, 2019 and that the order contains
serious errors. During the review hearing, the Tenant’s testimony included
information that led me to grant the review for a reason that was not
specifically identified in the Tenant’s review request. Rule 26.15 of the
Board’s Rules of Procedure allows the Board to grant a review based on an issue
that is not identified in the request but which the Member finds may amount to
a serious error in the order.
3.      In
this case, I granted the review because the Tenant’s testimony disclosed that
there was a fire in the residential complex in December 2018, which resulted in
the Tenant losing heat, water and electricity in the rental unit and, as of the
date of the review hearing, these services have not been restored. The Landlord
did not dispute that a fire occurred on the roof of the building in December
2018; that the fire was not caused by the Tenant and that the fire resulted in
the Tenant having no heat, water and electricity. As of the hearing date, only
part of the rental unit has electricity restored and while the Landlord was
anticipating that the water would be restored the following week, he could not
confirm when heat will be restored. 
4.      Based
on the parties’ evidence, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that for
over a year, the Tenant has not had several vital services in the rental unit.
The Landlord did not provide a reasonable explanation for why the Tenant has
been without these vital services for so long. The Landlord also did not
provide a reasonable explanation for why he did not take appropriate action to
address the situation through other means (for example, an N13 Notice of
Termination for extensive repairs with accompanying right of first refusal) to
avoid the Tenant having to live in (and pay for) an uninhabitable space while
work was being done on the building to repair any damage from the fire. When I
asked the Landlord why he did not serve the Tenant with an N13 Notice, the
Landlord only responded that he asked the Tenant to move out several times.
This was not a reasonable or appropriate approach to the situation.
5.      I
confirmed with the parties that the Landlord did not disclose the state of the
rental unit and the lack of vital services to the Board at the hearing on
December 3, 2019. I find that by failing to disclose these circumstances to the
Board, the Landlord abused the Board’s process because it withheld clear and
obvious grounds for mandatory relief of eviction under section 83(3) of the
Act. That provision requires the Board to deny a landlord’s request for
eviction where the landlord is in serious breach of its obligations under the
Act. I think it is fair to say that failing to ensure that the rental unit is
habitable and supplied with vital services is a serious breach of the Act, and
this breach was ongoing as of the December 3rd hearing date. By
failing to disclose these circumstances to the Board, even in the Tenant’s
absence, I find that the Landlord abused the Board’s process, and this resulted
in a serious error in the proceedings and the order. The review was granted on
this basis. 
6.      I
delivered my decision granting the review at the hearing and proceeded to hear
the application de novo (from the beginning). 
 
De
novo hearing 
7.      At
the hearing, the Landlord claimed the Tenant owes $7,390.00, including arrears
of rent to January 31, 2020 and the application filing fee. The Tenant did not
dispute the amount of rent the Landlord claims he paid for the period February
2019 – January 2020 ($3,600); however, the Tenant contends that he should not
have to pay the full rent he was charged after the fire and that he should
receive a significant rent abatement because he has not had water, heat and
electricity in the unit over this period. 
8.      I
considered the Tenant’s position under section 82 of the Act. That provision
allows a tenant to raise issues during the hearing of an L1 Application for
non-payment of rent which would otherwise form the basis for a tenant
application under the Act. Based on the evidence before me, I am satisfied on a
balance of probabilities that by failing to ensure that the Tenant had
electricity, water and heat in the rental unit, the Landlords failed to satisfy
their maintenance obligations under section 20(1) of the Act. The Tenant asked
for a rent abatement of at least 50% for this breach and I agree that this is
appropriate, given the magnitude and duration of the breach as well as the fact
that the Tenant has been forced to live elsewhere at times when the lack of
vital services in the rental unit was unbearable. Even the Landlord agreed that
a $500.00/month rent abatement would be reasonable in the circumstances.
Accordingly, I find that the Tenant is entitled to a $500.00 rent abatement for
each of the 13 months between December 23, 2018 when the fire took place and
the hearing date, for a total of $6,500.00. 
9.      When
the Tenant’s abatement is subtracted from the arrears claimed, I find that the
tenant owes the Landlord $890.00, including arrears to January 31, 2020 and the
application filing fee. The Tenant shall have 11 days to pay this amount,
failing which interest will accrue. 
10.   Since
the vital services were not restored as of the hearing date, I find that the
Landlords continue to be in serious breach of their maintenance obligations.
Accordingly, I cannot order eviction pursuant to section 83(3) of the Act. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
request to review order TSL-08283-19 issued on December 9, 2019 is granted. The
order is cancelled and replaced with the following. 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay the Landlords $890.00, which includes arrears of rent to
January 31, 2020 and the application filing fee.
3.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount owing by March 6, 2020
the Tenant will owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
March 7, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
