  HIGHWAY 15 KINGSTON ON K0H2N0


 




Between:


Deborah Leach

and


 




 


Sara Chesterton
  Tim Webster


Tenants



 
Deborah Leach (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tim Webster (TW) and Sara Chesterton (SC)
(the 'Tenants') because
a)    
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe.
b)    
the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard via
video/teleconference on November
10, 2021.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord's Legal Representative James
Moak, the Tenant
(SC) and the Tenant's Legal
Representative Thomas Oulton attended the hearing.
 
As of 2:50 p.m., the Tenant (TW) was not present
or represented at the hearing.
Tenant (SC) advised that TW
was no longer an occupant of the rental unit since April 3, 2021.
 
Background and Determinations:
 
Relating to the L1 Application
 
1.     The Landlord filed a L1 application on August 11, 2021
because the Tenant had not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to August 31,
2021.
 
2.     The Tenant was in possession of the rental
unit when the application was filed.
 
3.    
The monthly lawful rent was $1,400.00.
 
4.     The Tenant paid a total of $2,400.00 towards rent
after the application was filed. The Landlord applied a $1,400.00 credit towards the rent as the compensation
the Landlord was required
to provide to the Tenant
on the Landlord’s L2 application under section 48 of the
Act.




 
5.    
The Tenant's Legal Representative
raised that the N4 Notice served by the Landlord on August 11, 2021 did not correctly
set out the amount of arrears of rent owing as required by subsection 59(2) of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (“Act”) and opposes to an order to end the
tenancy based on an faulty N4 notice.
 
6.     It was subsequently determined that the amount of rent arrears
of rent owing as set out in the N4 notice of $400.00 was the
correct amount of arrears of rent owing but the method of calculation was the
error. I was initially satisfied on the face of the L1 application filed that
it correctly set out the amount of arrears of rent owing for the period ending
August 31, 2021.
 
7.     Upon further review,
the Landlord had not filed
a L1/L9 information update with the Board prior to the hearing. The purpose of
a L1/L9 information update form is to provide the Board with details of what
has transpired after the filing of the application.
 
8.    
The Board Rules and Procedures sets out in
Rule
10.1 a landlord who applies
for an order to evict a tenant for non-payment of rent and to collect rent the
tenant owes; or collect the rent the
tenant owes, must complete as of the Hearing Date an the "L1/L9 Information Update "
form containing complete
and accurate information about the tenancy and any arrears of rent owed as of the day of
the hearing. A copy must be provided to
the tenant, if present at the hearing, and the LTB.
Rule
10.2 states where the L1/L9
hearing is conducted as an electronic or written hearing, unless the LTB orders or directs
otherwise, the landlord
must provide an L1/L9 update form to the LTB and each tenant at least 5
days before the hearing.
 
Rule 10.3 - the LTB may refuse
to proceed with the hearing
until the L1/L9 update form is
completed.
 
9.     The Landlord’s Representative testified that the
Tenant has not paid the total rent to the Landlord owing by the Tenant to the Landlord
for the period ending August 1,
2021 to the period ending November 30, 2021. The Landlord's Legal
Representative stated
$1,800.00 was outstanding after crediting the $1,400.00 credit
towards the compensation the Landlord was required to
pay.
 
10.  The parties agreed
to proceed on the determination for rent arrears
owing for the period
ending November 30, 2021 so that the merits of the L2 application could be
heard and decided upon.
 
11.  The Tenant's Legal Representative disputed the amount
of rent arrears being claimed owing for the period ending November 30, 2021.
The Tenant asserted that additional funds were paid to the Landlord towards
rent, specifically $400.00
on August 6, 2021 and
$600.00 on October 20, 2021.
 
12.  The Landlord on cross examination confirmed receiving the $400.00 payment
on August 6, 2021.




 
13.  Therefore, with the $400.00 payment
being paid to the Landlord
on August 6, 2021 and with the $1,400.00 L2 application
compensation applied as a credit towards rent, effectively brought rent owing
to a zero balance.
 
14.  Based on this uncontested
fact, I was satisfied the Tenant had
paid all of the arrears of rent that came due up to August 31, 201,
and additional funds to pay the L1 application filing fee.
 
15.  I find pursuant
to subsection 74(2)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, the Landlord’s
L1 application was discontinued.
 
Relating to the L2 application
 
16.  This is an application under
section 48(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act).
 
17.  Subsection 48(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2006 (‘the Act’) which states in part:
“a landlord
may, by notice, terminate a tenancy if the landlord
in good faith requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation by
(a)  the landlord,
(b)  the landlord’s spouse, or
(c)  a child or parent
of the landlord or the landlord’s spouse.
 
18.  On July 31, 2021 the Tenant was served a (N12) Notice
to End the Tenancy setting out that the Landlord requires possession
of the rental unit for the following reason.
•        
use by the Landlord.
 
19.  The termination date in the (N12) notice
was September 30, 2021.
20.  The Tenants did not move out of the rental
unit in accordance with the termination date set out in the notice given.
21.  The technical requirements for granting an application under section 48 of the Act are
(a)  
The Notice:
 
48(2) The date for termination specified in a notice shall be at least 60
days after the notice is given and shall be the day a period of the tenancy ends or,
where the tenancy is for a fixed
term, the end of the term.
(b)  
Declaration or Affidavit
 
Subsection 72(1) of the Act requires
the Landlord to file an affidavit/declaration sworn by
the person who personally requires the rental unit and that person certifying that they in good faith
requires the rental unit for his or her own personal use for at least one year.




 
(c)  
Compensation
 
Section 48.1 of the Act requires
a landlord who has served a tenant with an N12 notice pursuant to section 48 to pay
compensation to the tenants in an amount equal to one month’s rent.
Section 55.1 of
the Act requires the compensation must be paid no later than on the termination date specified in the N12 notice of termination given
by the Landlord under
section 48.
 
22.  Based on the testimonies given and the documentary evidence
submitted by both parties,
I was satisfied that the Landlord has met the technical requirements for an
application under section 48 of the Act.
a.   
the notice has been properly
given,
 
b.   
a
declaration was filed and sworn to be given in good faith,
 
c.   
compensation was duly paid to the Tenant
 
23.  The Landlord's Legal Representative requested
a standard order
to termination of the
tenancy.
 
24.  The Tenant's Legal Representative submits
that the notice given was done in bad faith on
the premise that previous proceedings undertaken by the Landlord to end the
tenancy and evict the Tenant from the rental unit had failed and the notice
therefore was in
retaliation to the Tenants’
attempts to secure
or enforce her legal
rights and as such, the Board should grant relief from
eviction pursuant to section 83[(3)(c)] of the Act.
 
25.  I acknowledged that the Landlord was un successful in
an earlier action against the Tenant to end
the tenancy and evict the Tenant However, on balance, those
facts alone do not reasonably
establish an inference that this application was filed for an improper purpose
or in bad faith. The previous hearing was based on an application to end the
tenancy filed by the Landlord not the Tenant and was subsequently dismissed because
the Landlord did not meet her burden
of proof on the merits
of that application. The mere fact that
this second application is to end the tenancy in my opinion is immaterial.
 
26.  The Tenant's Legal Representative further
submitted that the steps taken by the Landlord
prior to the serving of the N12 notice to have the property appraised for
potential resale and or refinance given rise and suspect to the genuine intent
of the Landlord motive to require possession of the rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation.
 
27.  It is my view reasonable steps of
due diligence taken by a person in order to make
important life changing and financial decisions are prudent steps.
 
28.  All in all, I am satisfied, on a balance
of probability that the notice
given by the Landlord
was in good faith.




 
29.  After considering all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
I also find after considering all of the disclosed circumstances it would not be unfair
to postpone the eviction
until March 31, 2022 to provide the Tenant the additional time to find
alternative accommodation for her and her children.
 
30.  The order contains
all the reasons for the decision within
the order. No other reasons
will be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
Relating to the L1 Application
 
1.     The Landlord's L1 application is
discontinued.
 
Relating to the L2 application
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated, as of March 31, 2022.
The Tenants must have move out of the rental unit on or before March 31, 2022.
 
3.    
If the unit was not vacated
on or before March 31, 2022, then starting
April 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
4.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after April 1, 2022.
