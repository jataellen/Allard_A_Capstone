In the
  matter of:


105, 31 FAIR OAKS
PLACE BRAMPTON ON L6Y4W9


 




Between:


Peel Housing Corp O/A Peel
Living


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kevin Heron
Nichole Amanda Edwards


Tenants



 
 
Peel Housing Corp O/A Peel
Living (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kevin Heron and Nichole
Amanda Edwards (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because
the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the
Board on March 22, 2021 with respect to application CEL-97611-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to the
Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants have not met the following
conditions specified in the order: the Tenants
did not pay the lawful
rent for December
on or before December 1, 2021 nor did
they pay $500.00 on or before December 20, 2021.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenants were ordered
to pay $5,179.00 for rent arrears in Order CEL-97611-20-SA. The amount that is still owing from that order is $3,977.00 and that amount
is included in this order. As a result, the previous
order CEL-97611-20-SA is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from April 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.
 
6.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,341.03 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.




File Number: CEL-04403-22
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from January 1, 2021 to
January 18, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The previous order CEL-97611-20-SA is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 29, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlord $5,840.62*. This amount represents the rent owing up to December 31, 2021, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$46.09 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 1, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
29, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 30, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before January 29, 2022, then starting January
30, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 30, 2022.

The tenant has until January 28, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 28, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on July 30, 2022 if
the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
