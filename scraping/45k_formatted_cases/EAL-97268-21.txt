Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-97268-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


#6, 403
NELSON STREET OTTAWA ON
  K1N7S6


 




Between:


Outaouais Prospect Holdings Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Stephan Fortin


Tenant



 
 
 
Outaouais Prospect Holdings Inc
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Stephan Fortin
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 23, 2021.
Only the Landlord’s representative, H. Youssef, attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period from December
1, 2020 to November 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective August 23, 2021.
 
2.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), including the impact of the pandemic and whether the Landlord
attempted to negotiate a payment plan, and find that it would be unfair to
grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 29, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$6,941.73*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 18, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $18.08
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 19, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.




 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
29, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 30, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 29, 2022, then starting
January 30, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant
possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 30, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before January 29, 2022,
the Tenant pays the amount of $7,336.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in
trust, this order for eviction will be void.
This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after January
30, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
