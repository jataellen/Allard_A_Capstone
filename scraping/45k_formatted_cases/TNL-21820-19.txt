Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-21820-19
 










 
 
 

G-C
H of N (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
SM (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes;
and because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the
Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage.
 
This
application was heard in Newmarket on February 3, 2020.
 
The Landlord’s representative, TB, the Tenant and the Tenant’s
representative, LW, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from June 1, 2019 to February 29, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October 18, 2019.
 
2.      The
Tenant, who was represented by counsel at the hearing, did not dispute, or
otherwise challenge, the Landlord’s evidence of the Tenant’s rent arrears for
the period ending February 29, 2020.  Instead, the Tenant submitted that he
requires additional time to request a review of a May 28, 2019 decision
revoking the Tenant’s rent-geared-to-income assistance under the Housing
Services Act (the ‘HSA’). 
 
3.      Section
203 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) prevents the
Board from making determinations with respect to rent-geared-to-income
assistance under the HSA.  
 
4.      Based
on the evidence adduced at the hearing, I accept the Landlord’s evidence of the
Tenant’s rent arrears for the period ending February 29, 2020.
 
5.      The
Landlord proved that the Tenant has negligently permitted his dog to damage the
rental unit’s floors, by failing to take the dog out to urinate.  The Landlord
submitted photographs and repair estimates at the hearing.  The Landlord’s
photographic and documentary evidence show damage to the rental unit’s parquet
floors and its estimated $3,333.50 costs to repair or replace the flooring. 
This amount reflects the lesser of quotations the Landlord obtained from its
contractor.
 
6.      I
find that the damage from the Tenant’s dog’s urine is “Undue damage”, because
it did not arise through normal wear and tear.  
 
7.      The
Tenant did not dispute that his dog has urinated in the rental unit.  The
Tenant testified that neither he nor his girlfriend is able to take the dog
outside of the rental unit, because of physical limitations, and because of the
dog’s size.  The Tenant’s 11-year-old child is also unable to adequately
control the Tenant’s large dog, and the Tenant therefore does not rely on his
child to take the dog outside of the rental unit.
 
8.      Although
I accept that the Tenant’s and his partner’s physical limitations prevent them
from controlling the Tenant’s large dog, their circumstances do not release the
Tenant of his obligation to maintain the rental unit in a state of ordinary
cleanliness and to avoid causing undue damage to the property.  The Landlord
adduced documentary evidence of its past efforts to address damage caused by
the Tenant’s dog and the Tenant’s apparent inability to properly care for the
animal.  Despite these efforts, the Tenant has been unable or unwilling to
cooperate with the Landlord.  
 
9.      The
Tenant did not void the Landlord’s first Form N5 notice of termination by
repairing the damage and exercising regular control of his dog in the seven-day
period after receiving the notice on September 23, 2019.
 
10.   The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $238.26 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
11.   Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 1,
2018 to October 18, 2019.
 
12.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it would not be unfair to postpone
the eviction until April 30, 2020, pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
13.   The
Tenant gave evidence of his, his partner’s and his 11 year-old child’s
circumstances.  It is apparent from the Tenant’s testimony that the household
will require additional time to find new accommodations, because of the Tenant’s
and his partner’s physical limitations and financial circumstances.  I am also
mindful that the Tenant’s 11 year-old child works with a social worker at his
school.  I find that it is appropriate to give the Tenant time to work with the
social worker to minimize the impact to his son from changing residences.
 
14.   I
therefore conclude that it is appropriate to terminate the tenancy as of April
30, 2020.
 
15.   Since
the tenancy is being terminated for both non-payment of rent and for negligent
undue damage, this order shall not be voidable under section 74 of the Act. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before April 30, 2020.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $7,350.22*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to March 3, 2020, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $36.95 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting March 4, 2020 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before April
30, 2020, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from May 1, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 30, 2020, then starting May 1, 2020,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 1, 2020.
