In the matter
of:


UPPER UNIT,
10 PRIMROSE AVENUE HAMILTON ON L8L2K6


 




Between:


Gillian O'Connor


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Loribeth Kearnes
  Thomas Geroux


Tenants



 
 
Gillian O'Connor (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Loribeth Kearnes and Thomas Geroux (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 11, 2022. The Landlord and the Tenant, Loribeth
Kearnes attended the hearing. The Tenant declined
the opportunity to speak
with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 18, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,850.00.
 
4.    
The Tenants have made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,850.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from August 1, 2021 to September 18, 2021.
 
7.     It is uncontested the total rent arrears owing by the Tenants to the Landlord
to January 31, 2022 is
$9,250.00.




 
8.    
The Tenant requested the Board grant relief from eviction and impose a repayment plan that
would preserve the tenancy and allow them to make monthly payments
towards the rent owing.
Specifically, an additional $500.00 per month.
 
9.    
The Tenant stated she had lost her
job and while her husband continued to work, his hours had been significantly
cut so they were unable to pay the Landlord anything towards monthly rent,
however they are both now working full-time and take home approximately $5,200.00 per month. They reside in the unit with their 15 year old son.
 
10.  The Landlord requested the Board deny the Tenant’s
proposal as he does not believe the Tenants have shown good faith as they
have paid no rent after the first month they
moved in. The arrears are significant and he does not believe
they will fulfill
their promise.
 
11.  I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including the Tenant’s personal and financial
circumstances and weighed this against any potential prejudice to the Landlord
and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $9,436.00, which represents the arrears of rent
($9,250.00), and costs ($186.00) outstanding for the period ending January 31,
2022.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenants
is denied on the condition
that:
 
•        
The Tenants shall pay $500.00 to the Landlord
on or before the 1st of each month commencing on February 1, 2022, up to and including July 1, 2023.
 
•        
The Tenants shall pay $436.00 to the Landlord
on or before August 1,
2023.
 
•        
The Tenants shall also pay the
Landlord the rent for the months of February 2022 up to and including
August 2023 in full, on or before
the first day of each corresponding month.
 
3.     If the Tenants
fail to make any of the payments
in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates required, then:
 
(a)  
The Landlord may apply under
section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an
order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants, and for the payment of
any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not already ordered under paragraph 1
of this order. The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a
breach of a condition set out in paragraph 2 of this order.
 
(b)  
The balance owing under paragraph
1 of this order shall become payable on the day following the date of default.
The monies owing shall bear interest
at the post-judgment interest
rate determined under subsection 207(7) of the Act.
