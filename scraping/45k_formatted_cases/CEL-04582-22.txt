Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-04582-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


711, 2465 HURONTARIO STREET MISSISSAUGA ON L5A2G5


 




Between:


Imh Pool Ix-b Lp


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Magda Baczynski


Tenant



 
 
 
Imh Pool Ix-b Lp (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Magda Baczynski (the
'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent he owes because the
Tenant failed to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the Board on February
8, 2021 with respect to
application CEL-95371-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant
has not met the following condition specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $1693.03 rent
on or before February 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $9,267.97 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order CEL-95371-21. The amount that is still owing from that
order is $3,267.97 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order CEL-95371-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from February 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,608.03 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2016 to February 28, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order CEL-95371-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before March 11, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$3,201.64*. This amount represents the rent owing up to February 28, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$55.66 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting March 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before March 11,
2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 12, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 11, 2022, then starting March 12, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 12, 2022.
