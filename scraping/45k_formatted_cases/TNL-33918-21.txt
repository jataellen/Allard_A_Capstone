Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-33918-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


28 CHARLTON BOULEVARD NORTH YORK ON M2M1B9


 




Between:


Qing
  Sun


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Liran Dry
Stephine B Dry a.k.a. Stephanie B. Dry


Tenants



 
 
 
Qing Sun (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Stephine
B Dry and Liran Dry (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference ion November 8, 2021.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant Stephine
Dry a.k.a. Stephanie B. Dry attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on August
7, 2021.
 
3.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from May 28, 2021 to August 7,
2021.
 
4.     The Landlord claimed that the rent deposit was applied
to the last month of the initial lease and the Landlord did not collect a new deposit. This is supported by a previous voidable eviction
order issued by the Board on consent
(TNL-17109-19, issued on August
1, 2019). The order indicates that by
the time the order was issued the Landlord was not holding a rent deposit.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$9,348.47, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to August 7, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.




File Number: TNL-33918-21

If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before February
11, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 12,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
