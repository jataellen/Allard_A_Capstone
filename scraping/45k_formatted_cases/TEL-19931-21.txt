Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19931-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


ROOM 1 UPPER
LEVEL, 76 GLENCOYNE CRESCENT
SCARBOROUGH ON M1W2Z2


 




Between:


Zhi Yong Liang Mei
Yuan Liang


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Hua Sui


Tenant



 
 
 
Zhi Yong Liang
and Mei Yuan Liang (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Hua Sui (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 21, 2021.
 
The Landlords, the Landlords’ interpreter, Di Yu, the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Jessie Situ, the Landlords’ Agent, Erica
Liang, and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
On August 26, 2021, the
Landlords served the Tenant with an N12 Notice of Termination (N12) with a
termination date of October 31, 2021. The N12 seeks termination of the tenancy on the ground that the Landlord requires
the rental unit for residential occupation.
 
2.    
The Landlords
paid the Tenant
compensation equal to one month's
rent on August 26,
2021.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is
$500.00.
 
4.    
The Landlords
collected a rent deposit of $500.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlords.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from November 3, 2020 to October 30, 2021.




 
 
 
Good Faith
 
6.    
The N12 was served
pursuant to section
48 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act). Section 48(1) requires that, in
order to be successful in this application, the Landlords must establish that
at the time of the service of the N12 they required, in good faith, the unit
for residential use.
 
7.    
In Feeney v. Noble,
1994 CanLII 10538 (ON SC), the Court held that the test of good faith is
genuine intention to occupy the premises and not the reasonableness of the
Landlord’s proposal. This principle was upheld in Salter v. Beljinac 2001
CanLII 40231 (ON SCDC), where the Court held that the “good faith” requirement
simply means that the Landlord sincerely intends to occupy the rental unit. The
Landlord may also have additional motives for selecting a particular rental
unit, but this does not affect the good
faith of the Landlord’s notice.
 
8.    
In the more recent case
of Fava v. Harrison, [2014] O.J No. 2678 ONSC 3352 (Ont.Div.Ct.) the
Court determined that while the
motives of the Landlord are, per
Salter, “largely irrelevant”, the Board can consider the conduct and motives of
the Landlord to draw inferences as to whether
the Landlord desires,
in good faith to occupy
the property.
 
9.    
In this matter, the Landlords’ N12 was served
to the Tenant as the Landlords’ daughter intends to occupy the rental
unit for at least one year. The Landlords’ daughter, Erica Liang, submitted her
Affidavit stating her intent to move into the rental unit with the Landlords’
application. Both Landlords also submitted their Affidavits stating the same thing.
 
10.  At the hearing,
the Tenant submitted
that the Landlord, Mei Yuan Liang, did not put her proper legal name on the documents
served to the Tenant and therefore the Board should dismiss this application.
 
11.  The Landlord’s Legal Representative
responded by referring to the application which has the Landlord’s name Mei
Yuan (also known as MeiYuan) Liang. The Landlord’s Legal Representative
explained that sometimes in the Landlord’s culture, the first name could be written
first and the last name last and also that the two first names can also be written together without spacing.
 
12.  I have accepted
the explanation of how the names work in the Landlord’s culture
from the Landlord’s Legal
Representative and find that the Landlord‘s name does not contain any errors
which would allow me to dismiss this application on this basis as every
document submitted contains the name as either Mei Yuan, MeiYuan or both.
 
13.  Therefore, I am satisfied, based on the
Landlords’ evidence in this matter, that their daughter genuinely intends to
live in the rental unit for at least one year. I find that the Landlords in good faith require possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential
occupation for a family member for a period of at least one year.




 
Relief From Eviction
 
14.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until February 28, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
This will allow the Tenant the time to find another place to live.
 
15.  This order contains
all of the reasons in this matter
and no further reasons will be
issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlords
and the Tenant is terminated, as of February 28, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 28, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlords $600.97, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from October 31, 2021
to January 5, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the
rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords
$16.44 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from January 6, 2022 to
the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount
owing on or before February
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after March 1, 2022.
