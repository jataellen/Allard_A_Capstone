Mississauga Apartments Company (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Amanda Potts (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on December 6, 2021. The Landlord's Agent, Bryan Rubin, the Tenant and the Tenant's
Legal Representative Natalia
Czechowski attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to December 31,
2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 25, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant
is in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,029.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,029.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from March 1, 2012
to August 25, 2021.
 
6.    
The Tenant
paid $3,108.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including
the impact of COVID-19
on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment

agreement with the Tenant, and find that it
would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Commencing on January 20, 2022 to May 20, 2022 the Tenant shall pay $168.58 towards arrears on the last day of
the month.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall make a final payment
of $168.58 on or before June 30, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay the monthly
rent from January 1, 2022 to June 30, 2022 on or
before the first of the month.
 
4.     The balance owing under paragraph 1 of this
order shall become payable on the day following the date of default. The monies
owing shall bear interest at the post-judgment interest rate determined under
subsection 207(7) of the Act.
