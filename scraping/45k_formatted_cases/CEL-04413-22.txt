In the
  matter of:


UNIT 308,
1935 9TH AVENUE
EAST OWEN SOUND ON N4K6B6


 




Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Brian Thompson


Tenant



 
 
 
Grey Bruce Property Rentals
Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Brian Thompson (the 'Tenant')
and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the
Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on December 15, 2021 with respect to
application CEL-02301-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following condition
specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $1,113.20 rent
on or before January 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$6,756.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order CEL-02301-21. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $6,756.00 and that amount
is included in this order. As a result, the previous order CEL-02301-21 is
cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from January 01, 2022 to January 31, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,100.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period from December
19, 2020 to January 19, 2022.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.    
Order CEL-02301-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 30, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,768.10*. (less
any amount paid since the application was filed on January 7, 2022.)This amount
represents the rent owing up to January 19, 2022 and the costs related
to the application fee for the previous
application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $36.60 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 20, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
January 30, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
January 31, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before January 30, 2022, then starting January
31, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 31, 2022.
 
 
January 19, 2022

The tenant has until January 29, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 29, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on July 31, 2022 if
the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
