Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-85419-19
 
 
 
NTCH (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict MR  (the
'Tenant') because the Landlord has entered into an agreement of purchase and sale of the rental unit and the purchaser requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This
application was heard by video conference on January 20, 2022. The Landlord's
Legal Representative, P. B and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    At the hearing, the Landlord sought to withdraw the
application. In accordance with subsection 200(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, I consented to the
withdrawal of the application.
 
2.    The Tenant requested an order for costs of $250.00
against the Landlord alleging that the application was an abuse of process, and
having spent time preparing for the hearing, the Landlord informed him the day
prior that they would be withdrawing the application.
 
3.    The parties agree that the residential complex was
sold to a different purchaser in December 2021 and on December 23, 2021, the
Tenant was served with a new Notice to End your Tenancy Because the Landlord, a
Purchaser, or a Family Member Requires the Rental Unit.
 
4.    The Landlord's Legal Representative stated that he
received instructions to withdraw the application the day prior. After the
service of the new notice of termination on December 23, 2021, the Tenant filed
a certificate of pending litigation on December 30, 2021, hence the Landlord
was prevented from withdrawing the application on an earlier date.

5.    This application is based on an earlier Notice to End
your Tenancy Because the Landlord, a Purchaser or a Family Member Requires the
Rental Unit served on the Tenant in April 2019 because the rental unit was sold
to a purchaser who required possession of the
rental unit.
 
6.    As the rental
unit was sold to a different Purchaser in December 2021,
and a new notice of termination
served on the Tenant, whether or not the Tenant filed documents to try to stop
the sale is irrelevant to the fact that the sale in December 2021 effectively
renders this application moot. There was no way the Landlord could have validly
proceeded with this application and it should have been withdrawn at a much
earlier date.
 
7.    Delaying the withdrawal of the application until the
date of the hearing or informing the Tenant the day prior, is unreasonable in
the circumstance. The Board’s Interpretation Guideline 3 states that ‘A
Member has the discretion to require a party,
a party's agent or a party's
legal representative to pay, as costs, any representation or preparation expenses
of another party where the conduct of the party, a party's agent or a
party's legal representative was unreasonable’.
 
8.   
As a result, I find it fair to
award cost of $100.00 to the Tenant for time spent preparing for the hearing.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord's application is dismissed.
 
2.    
The Landlord shall pay $100.00 costs to the Tenant.
 
3.    
If the Landlord does not pay the
Tenant the full amount owing on or before, February 28, 2022, the Landlord will
start to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
