Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: TSL-24444-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


104, 169 BERRY ROAD TORONTO ON M8Y1W6


 




Between:


Angelo Scauzillo


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Chris Turner Lyndsay Ashby


Tenants



 
 
Angelo Scauzillo (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Chris Turner and Lyndsay Ashby (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 12, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Rosann Regina, attended the hearing. As of 2:42 p.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective February 18, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,204.94
as of January 1, 2022.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,204.94 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit has been paid to the Tenants
for the period from January
1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.
 
6.    
The Tenants paid $2,900.00
after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the




File Number: TSL-24444-21
 
Tenants, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 1, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$2,275.66*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 18, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $39.61
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 19,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before March 1, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from March 2,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 1, 2022, then starting
March 2, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 2, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)     $4,173.48 if the payment is made on or before
February 28, 2022,
or
ii)     $5,378.42 if the payment is made on or before
March 1, 2022**.
If the Tenants
do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March 2, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
