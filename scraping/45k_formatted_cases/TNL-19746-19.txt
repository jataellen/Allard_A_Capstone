Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-19746-19











 
 

VTCI (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict GC (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes (L1 application). 
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant has been persistently late
in paying his rent (L2 application). 
 
This application was heard in Toronto on January 9,
2020.
 
The Landlord’s employee, HD and
the Landlord’s representative, NM attended the hearing. The Tenant attended the
hearing and was self-represented. 
 
Prior to the hearing the Tenant
consulted with Tenant Duty Counsel. 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from December 1, 2018
to January 31, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective August 28, 2019.
2.     
The monthly rent as of the
date of the hearing is $850.00.
3.     
The rent is due on the first
day of each month.
4.     
There was no dispute that
the Tenant owes to the Landlord $12,090.00, which represents the arrear of rent
to January 31, 2020 and the application filing fee. 
5.     
The Tenant moved into the
unit in October 2017. 
6.     
In September 2018, the
Tenant had ongoing medical issues and went for a CT scan. The Tenant had severe
headaches and could not see. The Tenant had a tumor in the front part of his
brain and needed immediate surgery or he would lose his vision. The Tenant had
the surgery on May 6, 2019.
7.     
The Tenant is a
self-employed electrical contractor and had to stop working in October 2018 due
to his medical condition. The Tenant only began receiving monthly benefits from
OW in May 2019 in the amount of $864.00.
8.     
The Tenant is expecting to
be cleared by his doctor on February 6, 2020 to return to work. The Tenant says
that once he begins working, he will have the funds to pay the arrears. The
Tenant requested relief and stated that he could pay the rent when due
commencing February 1, 2020 and for 12 consecutive months; and can pay half of
the arrears by February 29, 2020 and the balance by March 31, 2020. The Tenant
also stated that if he is not cleared to return to work on February 6, 2020, he
will move out of the unit in 10 days.
9.     
The Landlord opposed any
relief and submitted that the Tenant has not paid any amount towards the rent
since January 2019 and the Landlord has been accommodating to the Tenant’s
situation. The Landlord is of the view that the Tenant cannot afford this unit.
10.  
I considered the Tenant’s
health situation and that he could not work for some time. I also considered
that the Tenant had funds and did not pay any amount towards the rent, not even
a token amount. Notwithstanding, I considered that the Act is remedial, and I
will give the Tenant an opportunity to continue the tenancy according to his
payment plan. 
11.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.  
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Tenant shall pay the
Landlord $12,090.00, which represents the arrears of rent owing up to January
31, 2020 ($11,900.00), plus the Landlord’s application filing fee ($190.00).
2.     
The Tenant shall pay the
amount set out in paragraph 1, above, according to the following schedule:
                                                On or
before February 29, 2020                $ 6,045.00
                                                On or
before March 31, 2020                     $ 6,045.00                                          
3.     
Commencing February 1, 2020
and for a period of 12 consecutive months (February 2020 to January 2021), the
Tenant shall also pay the monthly rent on or before the 1st day of
each month.
4.     
If the Tenant fails to make the
payments under paragraph 2, above, in full, the Landlord may collect the entire
outstanding balance from the amount set out in paragraph 1, above, immediately.

5.     
If the Tenant fails to make
payments under paragraphs 2, or 3, above, in full and on time, the Landlord may
apply under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (‘the
Act’) within 30 days of the breach, without notice to the Tenant, for an order
terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant; and requiring that the Tenant
pay any new arrears and NSF fees and related charges that become owing after
January 31, 2020.
