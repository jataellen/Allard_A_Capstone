Ishawna Ross


 



 
 
Interrent C/o
Clv Group (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Ishawna Ross (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the
rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued
by the Board on August 24, 2021 with respect to
application SOL-21460-21.
 
The Landlord's
application was heard by video conference on February 18, 2022. The Landlord's
Legal Representative, E. Jacob and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period from March 1, 2021 to August 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective April 27, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful monthly rent is $1,589.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant paid $6,778.50
after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Tenant did not dispute the
Landlord’s allegation that she failed to meet a condition specified in the
order issued by the Board on August 24, 2021 with respect to application SOL-21460-21.
 
6.     The Tenant testified that she lost her job, received
Employment Insurance benefits to August 2021 and since November 2021, has been
in receipt of approximately $900.00 monthly income from Ontario Works. The
Tenant, who moved into the rental unit in September 2020, acknowledged her inability to propose a payment plan due to her limited income.




File Number: SOL-26551-21
 
7.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,589.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
8.     Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period from January 1, 2022 to April 27, 2021.
 
9.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
including the impact
of COVID-19 on the
parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenant and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until March 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the
Act. The Landlord proposed and the Tenant, accepted the termination date of
March 31, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant
voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between
the Landlord and the
Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before March 31, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $10,346.34*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February 22,
2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $52.24 per day for
compensation for the use of the unit
starting February 23, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before March 31, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from April 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before March 31,
2022, then starting April 1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
April 1, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$12,464.50 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022,
or
ii)             
$14,053.50 if the payment
is made on or before
March 31, 2022**.

Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.




File Number: SOL-26551-21
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after April 1, 2022 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
