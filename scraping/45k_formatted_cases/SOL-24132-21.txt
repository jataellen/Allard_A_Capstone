Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: SOL-24132-21
 



In the
  matter of:


35, 57 FOREST
AVENUE HAMILTON ON L8N1X3


 




Between:


DMS Property Management Ltd.


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Snika Louis


Tenant



 
DMS Property Management Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Snika Louis (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 25, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative,
Frank Calcagni, attended the hearing. As of 10:33 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from July 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021.
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective August 20, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $813.06.
 
4.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $804.65
from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period from December
10, 2020 to August 20, 2021.
 
6.    
The Tenant paid $4,200.60 after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on
the parties and whether the Landlords attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 28, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
the Act.




File Number: SOL-24132-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.
 
2.    
As of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the
Landlord is entitled to by $52.12*.
 
3.     However, the Landlord
is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount the
Landlord owes the Tenant:
$26.73 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
February 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit,
and
$186.00 for
the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
The Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the other
any sum of money that is owed as a
result of this order.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
7.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)          
$899.12 if the payment is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)         
$1,712.18 if the payment is made on or before
February 28, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if the Tenant pays the amount
required under that subsection on or after March 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make
this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
