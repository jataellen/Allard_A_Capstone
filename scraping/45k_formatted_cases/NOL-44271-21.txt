Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44271-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


5,
  3 QUEEN STREET CAPREOL ON P0M1H0


 




Between:


1789700 Ontario
Limited


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Christopher Rannelli


Tenant



 
 
 
1789700 Ontario Limited (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Christopher
Rannelli (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit
or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully
or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 988 4914 7021# on February
7, 2022. Only the
Landlord Joseph Cividino attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord filed
two N5 notices that were served on the Tenant with the application. Both show they are 2nd N5 notices. The Landlord testified that he also served another
N5 earlier which was a 1st N5. The Residential Tenancies Act requires that an application be filed with the Board within 30 days of the termination date
on the notice. The termination date
on the 2nd N5 notice served after the 1st the Landlord testified that he served on the Tenant, is more than
the 30 days the Act permits. As such,
the Board has not jurisdiction to terminate the tenancy based on the notices
served.
 
2.     The Landlord chose to proceed
with the claim
for damages in the application.
 
3.    
The Landlord’s evidence is that the Tenant has caused three
floods affecting the unit
below. There is now an issue with the condition
of the drywall and a buildup of mold.
The Tenant has also kicked in the door multiple times.
 
4.    
Based on the evidence
before me I find the Tenant has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit
and to the residential complex.




File Number: NOL-44271-21
 
5.    
The Landlord will incur costs that will exceed
the $5,000.00 claimed
in the application to repair
the damage and replace property that was damaged and cannot be reasonably repaired.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$5,000.00, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage and
replacing the damaged property.
 
2.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
February 25, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
