Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-21311-22
 
 



In the
  matter of:


47 SAILORS
LANDING DRIVE BOWMANVILLE ON
  L1C4G7


 




Between:


Antonina Kotorobai


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jennifer Blankey
  Kenneth Ferrill


Tenants



 
 
 
Antonina Kotorobai (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kenneth Ferrill
and Jennifer Blankey
(the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the
rent they owe because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified in the order
issued by the Board on December 21, 2021 with
respect to application EAL-97257-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants
have not met the following
condition specified in the order: The
Tenant failed to pay the lawful monthly rent in full, on or before January 1,
2022.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $11,301.00 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order EAL-97257-21. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $11,301.00 and that amount
is included in this order. As a result, the previous order EAL-97257-21 is
cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from December 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,600.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from December 1, 2020 to January 20, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order EAL-97257-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 31, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $13,008.00*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January
20, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the previous
application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $85.48 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 21, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
31, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 31, 2022, then starting
February 1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 1, 2022.
 
 
January 20, 2022

The tenant has until January 30, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 30, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on August 1, 2022 if the order
has not been filed on or before
this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
