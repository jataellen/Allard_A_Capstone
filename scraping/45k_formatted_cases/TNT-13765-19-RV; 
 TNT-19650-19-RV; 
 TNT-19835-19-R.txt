Review Order
 
TG (the 'Tenant') applied for an
order determining that C (the 'Landlord') harassed, obstructed, coerced,
threatened or interfered with the Tenant and substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenant or by a member of the Tenant's household.
 
This application was resolved
by order TNT-13765-19 , TNT-19650-19 and TNT-19835-19 issued on July 26, 2021.
 
On August 3, 2021 the Tenant requested a review of the order.
 
On August 11, 2021 interim order TNT-13765-19 RV-IN,
TNT‐19650‐19-RV-IN and TNT‐19835‐ 19-RV-IN, was issued,
staying the order issued on July 26, 2021.
 
The request was heard by videoconference on November 3, 2021.
 
The Tenant and the Landlord’s Representative, KL attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     I considered the Tenant’s submission and listened to the recording
of the hearing held on February 4, 2021 and I find no serious
error is contained in the order or occurred in the proceedings.
 
2.     The Board determined the Tenant’s T2 application was
barred since the issue was considered and a final decision
was made by the Human Rights Tribunal.
The Tenant’s case before the
Human Rights Tribunal was heard in April 2018 and she asserts the




presiding Member did not receive submissions about whether the Tenant could
raise this issue under her T2 application about accessible parking
issues for the period from December 2018 to March 7, 2019. The Tenant also
asserts she was not able to use her accessible parking spot during that period
while the Landlord was doing major repairs of the parking lot and the Board
ought to have considered the issue and heard evidence about it at the original
hearing.
 
3.     The Landlord does not dispute there was no in-depth
discussions on the issue. The Member considered submissions made on the issue as expressed in paragraph 19 of the order issued on July 26, 2021. Absent
a serious error, a review is not an opportunity to reargue your case in hopes
of a more favourable outcome. Nor is it an opportunity to present evidence and
submissions that could and should have been presented at the original hearing.
 
4.     Even if I found there was an error in proceeding there’s
no dispute the Tenant received an abatement of rent from
December 2019 to June 2019 which was paid in December 2019 which was based on
5% abatement which addressed this issue and period of contention. There was a
mediated settlement reached on this issue. Based on submission made it appears
this issue was resolved on consent.
 
5.     The Tenant also submits that she submitted
photographic evidence to the Landlord
Tenant Board (the ‘Board’)
that became degraded
by digital scanning.
As a result, the Tenant submits her evidence was not properly considered
by the hearing Member.
 
6.     The Order issued on July 16, 2021 acknowledges the
poor quality of the photographs as noted in paragraph 5. After listening to the recording, the Tenant was given an
opportunity to describe the photographs by viva voce evidence. The Member
acknowledges there was a continuous water leak in the parking garage and
further acknowledges the JG disagreed with the “Tenant’s description of the water leak”
as noted in paragraph 8 where
the Member also made a finding there was no work order issued to the building
because of a breach of maintenance and housing standards. The Tenant had opportunity to raise concerns
about the quality
of the photograph to the presiding member and she did not satisfy me that
color photographs would have changed the result of the order.
 
7.     The Order sets out reasonable findings of fact to support
the Member’s conclusion. The Member’s exercise of discretion is within reasonable and
acceptable outcomes. Reasonable exercise of discretion is not interfered with
on review.
 
8.     The Tenant submits the Member considered evidence that
was not properly disclosed. I make no findings on this issue as it was
addressed in paragraphs 2 to 6 of Interim order TNT‐13765‐19-RV-IN, TNT‐19650‐19-Rv-IN and TNT‐19835‐19-RV-IN, issued on August
11, 2021.
 
9.     On the basis of the submissions made in the request, I am not satisfied that there is a
serious error in the order or that a serious error occurred in the proceedings.
 
It is ordered that:




 
1.    
The request to review
order TNT-13765-19, TNT-19650-19 and TNT-19835-19 issued
on July 26, 2021 is denied. The order is confirmed and remains
unchanged.
