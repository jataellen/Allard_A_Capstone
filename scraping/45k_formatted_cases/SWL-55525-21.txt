Holborn Holdings Ltd. (the

and Victoria Fournier
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 20, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Daniel
Rooz, attended the hearing. As of 10:32 a.m. the Tenants were not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this
hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants did not pay the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 27, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,525.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     
The only amount outstanding is the Landlord's cost of filing the application. As a result, the order will be limited to costs
only and not eviction.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
