Review Order
 
GK (the
'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict AP (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
The application was
resolved by order CEL-63965-17, issued on February 10, 2017.
 
On February 21,
2017, the Tenant requested a review of the order.
 
The Tenant’s review
request was heard in Mississauga on March 16, 2017.
 
The
Landlord, GK, and the Tenant attended the hearing. The Landlord was represented
by ER.
 
Determinations:
 
       The
Review Request
1.     
The Tenant did not attend the February 8, 2017
hearing. She claims that she did not receive the Notice of Hearing and was
unaware of the hearing.
 
2.     
The Tenant does not have independent access to
the mail box. The Landlords live in the unit above the Tenant and the Landlords
have the key to the locked Canada Post box on the street. The Tenant must rely
on the Landlords to deliver her mail.
 
3.     
Although the Landlord, GK, provided a photograph
of the envelope the Board mailed to the Tenant with the notice of hearing
inside, this photo does not establish that it was delivered to the Tenant or
that she ever received it.
 
4.     
The relationship between the Landlord and the
Tenant has been tense and mistrustful since at least October 2016. Both sides
want this tenancy to end.
 
5.     
Since the Tenant disputes the amount of rent
owing and does not dispute that the tenancy should end, I find it more likely
than not that the Tenant would have attended the hearing if she received the
Notice of Hearing. As a result, the Tenant’s review request is granted.
 
     The Rent Arrears
 
6.     
The tenancy commenced on August 1, 2016. The
monthly rent is $700.00. This is undisputed.
 
7.     
However, the amount of rent arrears owing is
disputed.
 
8.     
The Landlord claims that the Tenant owes the
full rent from November 2016 to March 2017 ($700.00 x 5 months = $3,500.00
claimed).
 
9.     
The Tenant claims that only January to March
rent is owing ($700.00 x 3 months = $2,100.00). She states that she paid
November and December rent on January 4, 2017. 
 
10.   The Tenant has a text message from the Landlord confirming receipt
of $1,400.00 on January 4, 2017 for the November and December 2016 rent.
 
11.   There are similar text messages in the Tenant’s phone confirming
receipt of the August, September and October 2016 rent and the Landlord agrees
that she sent those messages.
 
12.   However, the Landlord stated that she did not receive the $1,400.00
payment, she did not send the January 4th text and she alleges that
the Tenant created a fake text message.
 
13.   It is certainly possible to create a fake or misleading text
message. For example, the Tenant could have had a friend send her a text
message stating that $1,400.00 was received.
 
14.   To establish the authenticity of the text message I viewed the
message in the Tenant’s cell phone. I clicked on the message and it showed the
phone number the text was sent from. The Landlord confirmed the number was her
cell phone number. When I clicked on the message again a pop up box appeared
stating I could call the sender of the text message.
 
15.   When I clicked on that, the Landlord’s cell phone rang in the
hearing room.
 
16.   Based on this I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that it
is more likely than not that the Landlord sent the Tenant the text message
confirming receipt of the $1,400.00 payment for the November and December 2016 rent.
 
17.   If Landlord’s allegation (that the Tenant was able to create a fake
message and attach it to the Landlord’s cell phone number) were true then the
Tenant would be very tech savvy and would have gone to some trouble to create
the fake message and attach it to the Landlord’s cell number. If she were able
to do that, then it would be expected that she would continue on with her false
claim and create fake messages to claim the January, February and March rent
were also paid. Yet, she is not disputing that those months are owing to the
Landlord.
 
18.   There was a similar text message from the Landlord in the Tenant’s cell
phone confirming receipt of the last month's rent deposit in the amount of
$700.00 paid on July 25, 2016.
 
19.   I accept that text message to establish the last month's rent
deposit and the date it was collected.
 
20.   The Tenant has not paid $2,100.00 ($700.00 x 3
months) of the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
November 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017. Because of the arrears, the Landlords
served a Notice of Termination effective January 18, 2017.
21.   The Landlords collected a rent deposit of
$700.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlords.
22.   Interest on the rent deposit, in the amount of
$5.13, is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 25, 2016 to January 18,
2017.
23.   I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
24.   The Tenant stated that she is looking for a new place to move and
wants to move as soon as possible but, as of the hearing date, she was not
certain of an exact date she will be moving. She is currently unable to make
any payment towards the three months of rent that are owing. As a result, termination
of the tenancy is ordered.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Tenant’s review request
is granted. Order CEL-63965-17, issued on February 10, 2017, is cancelled and
replaced by the following: 
2.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant is
terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before April 7,
2017.
3.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlords $1,273.80*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to March 27, 2017, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $23.01 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
March 28, 2017 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
5.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before April 7, 2017, then starting April 8, 2017, the Landlords may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlords, on or after April 8, 2017.
8.     
If the Tenant wishes
to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the
Landlords or to the Board in trust:
i)        $2,275.00 if the payment is made on or before March 31, 2017, or
ii)       $2,975.00 if the payment is made on or before April 7, 2017**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after April 8, 2017 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlords.
