Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55291-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1411, 425 WILSON AVENUE KITCHENER ON N2C2R8


 




Between:


Drewlo Holdings Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Aleksandra Krajishnik


Tenant



 
 
 
Drewlo Holdings Inc (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Aleksandra Krajishnik (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 13, 2022. Only
the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Christine Philp, attended the hearing. As
of 9:46 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
The parties had submitted a payment agreement to the Board prior to the
hearing, however no order had been issued. The Landlord’s Representative
indicated that they were still agreeable to the payment plan and would like an
order issued to that effect. I was satisfied that the Tenant when completing
the agreement understood the consequences of the submission and will issue an
order in accordance with their agreement.
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $1,809.27, which represents the arrears of rent ($1,548.27), NSF charges ($75.00) and costs ($186.00)
outstanding for the period
ending January 31, 2022.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant
is denied on the condition
that:
 
(a)  
The Tenant shall make the following payments to the Landlord in respect of the
monies owing under paragraph 1 of this order:

(b)  
The Tenant shall also pay the Landlord the rent for the months
of February and March 2022 in
full, on or before the first day of each month.
 
3.    
If the Tenant fails to make any of the payments
in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates required, then:
 
(a)   The Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order terminating the tenancy and
evicting the Tenant, and for the payment of any new arrears of rent and NSF
charges not already ordered under paragraph 1 of this order. The Landlord must
make the application within 30 days of a breach of a condition set out in
paragraph 2 of this order.
 
(b)   The balance owing under paragraph 1 of this order
shall become payable on the day following the date of default. The monies owing shall bear interest at the
post-judgment interest rate determined under subsection 207(7) of the Act.
