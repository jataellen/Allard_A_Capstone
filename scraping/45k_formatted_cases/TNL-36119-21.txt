Tenant




 


Robert Carido


 



 
 
 
Beverly Donn
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Robert
Carido (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit
or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully caused
undue damage to the premises and/or used the rental unit or the residential
complex in a manner that is inconsistent with use as a residential premises and
that has caused or can be expected to cause significant damage; and seriously
impaired the safety of any person. The Landlord also claimed compensation for
each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This
application was heard by video conference on January 14, 2022. The Landlord’s
Agent, Z. Gamo and the Landlord's Legal Representative, R. Basser attended the
hearing. As of 9:40 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord served the Tenant with a 10-Day Notice to
Terminate a Tenancy Early (N7) with a termination date of December 4, 2021. The
Landlord alleged in the notice that on November 22, 2021, “CAR BLEW UP, CAUSED
A SERIOUS FIRE, DAMAGED OTHER TENANTS’ CARS. FRIGHTENED OTHERS”; on “20, 21, 22/2021”
the Tenant washed
his dog in the laundry room; and
from March 1, 2021 to November 22, 2021, the Tenant “escaped from the
hospital”.
 
2.     During the hearing, the Landlord explained that on
November 22, 2021, the Tenant placed something in his car, went up to his unit
after which the car exploded. The Tenant subsequently informed the Landlord
that he blew up the car, but this critical information was not included in the
notice of termination.
 
3.     A notice of termination given by a Landlord must set
out the reasons and details respecting the termination. In Ball v. Metro
Capital Property, [2002] O.J. No. 5931, the Divisional Court decided that the notice given by the Landlord
lacked sufficient details




File Number: TNL-36119-21
 
and that the purpose of the
notice is to ensure the Tenant knows the case to be met and is in a position to
decide whether or not to dispute the allegations at a hearing.
 
4.     In this case, the Landlord’s notice of termination is
missing important information on how the Tenant caused the explosion and only
at the hearing was it revealed that the Tenant admitted to causing the
explosion. I find this information critical and should have been included in
the notice of termination.
 
5.     Furthermore, the Tenant could not have “escaped from
the hospital” every day from March 1, 2021 to November 22, 2021. The Landlord
also fails to indicate the month in which the Tenant washed his dog in the
laundry room.
 
6.     Allowing evidence on the month to be given at the
hearing or clarifying the dates on which
the Tenant “escaped from the hospital”, will be tantamount to not providing
notice to the Tenant. Therefore, I
find the N7 notice defective and the Board will not issue an order terminating
the tenancy without a valid notice of termination.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord's application is dismissed.
