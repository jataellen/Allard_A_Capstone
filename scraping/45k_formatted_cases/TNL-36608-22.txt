Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-36608-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


1801, 180 CHALK FARM
DRIVE TORONTO ON M3L2H8


 




Between:


Greenboard Holdings Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Dorothy Robinson
  Sean Smith


Tenants



 
 
 
Greenboard Holdings Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dorothy Robinson and Sean Smith
(the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because
the Tenants failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on April 12, 2021 with respect
to application TNL-27945-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I
find that the Tenants have not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The
Tenants failed to pay the lawful
monthly rent in full, on or before
January 1, 2022. The
Tenant failed to pay $500.00 towards the arrears on or before January 20, 2022.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears
of rent and compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenants were ordered
to pay $5,601.12 for rent arrears in Order TNL-27945-20. The amount that is still owing from that order is $1,095.93 and
that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order
TNL-27945-20 is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenants
have failed to pay the full
rent that became owing
for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.




File Number: TNL-36608-22
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TNL-27945-20 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 25, 2022.
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$3,554.88*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to February 14, 2022.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $55.38
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 15,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
25, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 25, 2022, then starting
February 26, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 26, 2022.

The tenant has until February 24, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by February
24, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of
