Order under
Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number:
EAL-98066-21




 
In the matter
  of:


 
686 MORIN STREET OTTAWA ON K1K3G9


 




Between:


1270767 Ontario
Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kenneth Mcgrath


Tenant



 
 
 
1270767 Ontario Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kenneth Mcgrath
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant entered
into an agreement
to terminate the tenancy.
 
This application was heard
by video conference on December 16, 2021, beginning
at 9:00 a.m..
 
Only the Landlord’s Agent Mbaka Wadham attended the hearing. As of 9:45 a.m. the Tenant was not present or represented at this
hearing, although properly served with a notice of the hearing by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Landlord and the Tenant signed an agreement
to terminate the tenancy as of March 31, 2021.
 
2.       
As a preliminary issue, the
Landlord’s Agent M.W. sought permission to correct a clerical error in the
application, specifically to remove the unit number from the style of cause.
This correction coincides with the address set out in the N11 Agreement to End
the Tenancy and the declarations of (i) the Tenant, signed
September 28, 2021 and (ii) Julius
Dawn, signed September 29, 2021. The request to amend the application is
granted.
 
3.       
M.W. submitted that the Tenant was
not present at the hearing because he was recovering from surgery. This submission is supported by the Tenant’s
declaration, dated September
28, 2021. The Tenant submitted the declaration to the Board, to confirm his
agreement to end the tenancy and to vacate the rental unit on or by March 31,
2022.
 
4.       
I was satisfied that the parties
have mutually agreed to resolve all matters at issue in the application and
that the Tenant does not oppose the order. I was also satisfied that the
parties understood the consequences of the Landlord’s submissions.
