Review Order
 
T.C.H.C. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict H.B (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved by order TSL-95896-18
issued on June 27, 2018.
 
On December 14, 2018, the Tenant
requested a review of the order and that the order be stayed until the request
to review the order is resolved. 
 
On December 17, 2018, interim
order TSL-95896-18-RV-IN was issued, staying the order issued on June 27, 2018.
 
The request was heard on January
24, 2019 and May 2, 2019.
 
On January 24, 2019, the
Landlord’s legal representative, F.F, the Tenant and the Tenant’s legal
representative, L.K, attended the hearing. 
 
On May 2, 2019, only the parties’
legal representatives attended the hearing. The Tenant did not attend. 
 
Determinations:
 
The Tenant’s request to review is granted
1.     
On January 24, 2019, the
matter was adjourned on consent of the parties. The Landlord’s legal
representative also advised that the Landlord was consenting to the Tenant’s
request to review. The Tenant’s request to review was granted on that basis. A de
novo (new) hearing was scheduled for May 2, 2019. 
The hearing on May 2, 2019
Tenant’s adjournment request denied
2.     
At the outset of the
hearing, the Tenant’s legal representative requested an adjournment on the
Tenant’s behalf. She advised that she has been unable to contact the Tenant
since the last hearing in January, 2019 despite multiple attempts. She also
advised that she believes the reason the Tenant did not attend the May 2nd
hearing is because he is experiencing a relapse of the symptoms of his mental health
condition. She did not have any direct information or any documentation –
medical or otherwise – to substantiate why the Tenant failed to attend the
hearing. 
3.     
The Landlord’s legal
representative opposed the adjournment request. She submitted that there has
already been substantial delay in this matter. The Landlord filed the L1
Application in May, 2018 and the arrears go back to December, 2017. The
Landlord’s legal representative was willing to consent to a short adjournment
to May 8, 2019 when another application regarding this tenancy was scheduled to
be heard. However, the Tenant’s legal representative advised that she did not
believe that this adjournment would be effective because it was unlikely she
could locate the Tenant in short a short period of time when previous attempts
were unsuccessful.  
4.     
After considering both
parties’ submissions, I denied the Tenant’s adjournment request. Ultimately, I
did not have a concrete explanation for why the Tenant failed to attend the
hearing and the Tenant’s legal representative was unable to provide any
assurances that the Tenant would attend a future hearing date if the matter was
postponed. At the same time, this proceeding has been ongoing for considerable
time and the arrears are significant. If the matter was adjourned the arrears
would likely increase to the point where they may exceed the Board’s monetary
jurisdiction. In the circumstances, I find that the prejudice to the Landlord
of delaying this matter, outweighs the prejudice to the Tenant of going ahead
with the hearing in his absence. 
5.     
I delivered my decision at
the hearing that the adjournment was denied and that I would be hearing the
application de novo that day. The Tenant’s legal representative advised that
she would not be participating in the merits hearing because she did not have
instructions from the Tenant to do so. Therefore, I heard the application on an
uncontested basis. 
The Tenant owes the Landlord $21,355.00
6.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from December 1, 2017
to June 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective March 28, 2018.
7.     
Based on the Landlord’s
uncontested evidence, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the
Tenant owes the Landlord $21,355.00, which includes arrears to May 31, 2019 and
the application filing fee.
8.     
The Tenant is in possession
of the rental unit. 
9.     
The monthly rent is
$1,253.00.
10.  
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,135.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
11.  
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from March 29, 2018 to March 28, 2018.
12.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. In addition to
the circumstances that were disclosed as part of the Tenant’s adjournment
request, I also considered that the Landlord attempted to resolve the
application without eviction by referring the matter to the Commissioner of
Housing Equity to assist the Tenant with his arrears. Unfortunately, that
process was not successful and it appears that the Landlord is now pursuing
eviction as a remedy of last resort.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Tenant’s request to
review order TSL-95896-18 issued on June 27, 2018 is
granted. 
2.     
Order TSL-95896-18 issued on June 27, 2018 is
cancelled and replaced with the following terms:
3.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before May 24,
2019.
4.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $19,111.36*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to May 13, 2019, less the rent deposit.
5.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $40.47 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
May 14, 2019 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
6.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
7.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May 24, 2019, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from May 25,
2019 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
8.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before May 24, 2019, then starting May 25, 2019, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
9.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 25, 2019.
10.  
If, on or before May 24,
2019, the Tenant pays the amount of $21,355.00** to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
11.  
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after May 25, 2019 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
