Tenant



 
 
 
Payaam Jahanbazi (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Larry Renshaw (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 8, 2022. The Landlord and the
Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period
from June 1, 2017 to October
31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective October
23, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on February
3, 2022. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,500.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of February
3, 2022, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$9,524.17*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 3, 2022.




File Number: SOL-25550-21
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 25, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
