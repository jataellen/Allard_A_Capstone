Review Order
 
Jayagowri
Thuthikaivel (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Oladele Onabanjo (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. This is the L1 application.
 
Jayagowri
Thuthikaivel (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Oladele Onabanjo (the 'Tenant')
because the Landlord requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of
residential occupation. This is the L2 application.
 
These applications were resolved by order CEL-92373-20 issued on May 17, 2021.
 
On June 14, 2021, the Tenant requested a review of the order and
that the order be stayed until
the request to review the order is resolved.
 
On June 18, 2021, interim order CEL-92373-20 -IN was issued,
staying the order
issued on May 17, 2021.
 
The request
was heard by videoconference on July 20, 2021.
 
Only the Tenant attended the hearing
when the matter was called
at 10:08am. The Tenant
consulted with Tenant Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
Determinations:
 
REQUEST TO
REVIEW
 
1.    
The Tenant’s request
for review asserts the Tenant was not reasonably able to participate in the original
hearing of the application as he did not receive
the notice of hearing for the hearing date March 22,
2021.




 
2.    
He explains that he
moved out of the rental unit on March 5, 2020 after securing another place on
March 3, 2020. On that day, the police were called by the Landlord after the
Tenant made a threat which resulted in the Tenant being arrested and removed from
the property. Since that day, the Tenant did not attend
the premises, except on one occasion,
with police escort, to retrieve her phone. The Tenant testified that he
surrendered the keys by leaving them in the basement on March 5, 2020.
 
3.    
With respect to the
mail, the Tenant testified that it wasn’t until she picked up his mail from the
new owners to find the order that he realized he had missed the hearing. He
believes the old Landlord
withheld his mail when he picked it up from the premises. No further evidence was submitted in support of this assertion.
 
4.    
In both Bouillon v. Kennedy, [2011] O.J. No. 2223 (Ont. Div. Ct.) and
Kewallal v. Jackson, [2011] O.J. No. 1219 (Ont.
Div. Ct.) the Court indicated that the Board should have granted review
requests where the allegation was that the notice of hearing was not actually
received.
 
5.    
The Board’s records
show the notice of hearing for March 22, 2021 was served to the Tenant via mail at the rental
unit on February 25, 2021, when the Tenant was no longer
in possession of the rental unit.
The Board’s records
do not indicate that the mail returned
to the Board.
 
6.    
Based on the Tenant’s
uncontested evidence before the Board,
I find that the Tenant was
not reasonably able to participate at the hearing held on March 22, 2021. The
Tenant’s request to review was granted and I proceeded to hear the Landlord’s
L1 application de novo in an uncontested manner since the L2 application
had been withdrawn and since the Tenant no longer had possession of the rental
unit.
 
PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
7.    
The Landlord’s applications were filed with the Board on December 23, 2019. At this time, the Tenant was in possession of the
rental unit.
 
8.    
A case management
hearing was scheduled on December 15, 2020 where the L2 application was withdrawn as the Landlord
indicated the Tenant
vacated the rental
unit on October 28, 2020. The
Tenant was not in attendance at this hearing. The notice of hearing for this
hearing was served to the Tenant via mail at the rental unit on November 5,
2020 – when the Tenant was no longer in possession of the rental unit.
 
9.    
The application was
directed to a merits hearing which was held on March 22, 2021 and an order was issued
May 17, 2021, which was the subject
of the Tenant’s review request.
 
L1 APPLICATION
 
10.  The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
November 1, 2019 to March 5, 2020. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination effective December 21, 2019.
 
11.  The Tenant was in possession of the rental
unit.




 
12. 
The lawful
monthly rent was
$1,200.00.
 
13.  The Tenant’s uncontested evidence was he
moved out of the rental unit on March 5, 2020.
As such, the request for eviction under this application was no longer necessary.
 
14.  The Tenant’s uncontested evidence was, since the application was filed, the Tenant
made no payments towards the arrears.
 
15.  The Tenant submits
the Landlord also collected a damage deposit
of $500.00 which was
not accounted for in the last month's rent deposit shown in the application for $1,200.00.
 
16.  The Tenant seeks relief in the repayment of
these arrears as the Tenant is currently out of a home and out of work;
further, the Tenant receives limited income whose main source is benefits from
the Ontario Disability Support Program. The Tenant requests making payments
in $150.00 installments on the last day of each month until the balance
is paid in full commencing October 2021.
 
ANALYSIS
 
17.  Based on the evidence before the Board I
find the arrears and costs owing to March 5, 2020 total $3953.56. I say this based on the Tenant’s
uncontested evidence that he made no payments between November 2019 and
March 2020 and surrendered vacant possession of the rental unit on March 5,
2020.
 
18.  With respect to the last month rent deposit, I find that the amount
held was $1,200.00. I say this based on the Landlord’s application and the Tenant’s
own evidence that the additional $500.00 was a damage deposit – which may be
the subject of another application – but no evidence was produced at the
hearing of this additional amount.
 
19.  Since the Tenant mentioned the $500.00 on his request
to review, I would have expected
him to produce evidence at the hearing in support of his assertion.
 
20.  Finally,
with respect to the relief requested by the Tenant,
as it was unopposed, and the
Landlord was not present to articulate their circumstances, the Tenant’s
request is granted.
 
21.  The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,200.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
22.  Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 1, 2018 to December 21, 2019.
 
23.  An order shall issue accordingly.
 
24.  This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It
is ordered that:




 
1.    
The request
to review order
CEL-92373-20 issued on May 17, 2021 is granted
and replaced with the following order.
 
2.    
The interim
order issued on June 18, 2020 is cancelled.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $3,763.56 which represents arrears for the period ending March 5, 2020, less the last month's
rent deposit and interest owed to the Tenant.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
The total amount owing under this order is $3,953.56.
 
6.    
The
Tenant shall pay the amount owing in paragraph 5 in installments of $150.00 on
the last day of each month
commencing January 31, 2022 for the next 26
months with a final payment of
$53.56 on the last day of the 27th month.
7.    
If the
Tenant fails to make any one of the payments in accordance with paragraph 6 of
this order, the outstanding balance shall become immediately due and owing and
the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from the day after the breach at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
