Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-34490-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


148 DOWNSVIEW AVENUE DOWNSVIEW ON M3M1E5


 




Between:


Augusto Persico


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Connie
Pistillo


Tenant



 
 
 
Augusto Persico (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Connie Pistillo (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on December
13, 2021. The Landlord
and the Tenant attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period
from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective July 26, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,425.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
6.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until January 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 31, 2022.




File Number: TNL-34490-21
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $18,529.63*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 5, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $46.85
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 6, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing*
on or before January 31, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022, then starting February
1, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 1, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 31, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $19,851.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain
in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
