Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55731-21
 



In the matter
of:


MAIN, 64 ROGERS AVENUE LONDON ON N6H1G7


 




Between:


Maria Kaminskyj


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Travis Claeren


Tenant



 
 
Maria Kaminskyj (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Travis Claeren (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 20, 2022. Only the Landlord
attended the hearing. As of 10:50 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from October 1, 2020 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 16, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $700.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant paid $2,500.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 11, 2022.

2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$3,520.59*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 31, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $23.01
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
11, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 12, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 11, 2022, then starting February
12, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 12, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$3,701.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$4,401.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 11, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 12, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
