In the matter
of:


95
CREDITSTONE ROAD BRAMPTON
  ON L6Y4G1


 




Between:


Braden Mcarthur


Tenant




 


 
and


 




 


Lillian Mendoza


Landlord



 
 
Braden Mcarthur (the 'Tenant') applied for an order
determining that Lillian Mendoza (the 'Landlord') has collected or retained money illegally.
 
The hearing was held by videoconference on February 10, 2022. The Tenant and the Landlord were both present at the hearing. The
Tenant’s agent, Kim Mcarthur, was
also present at the
hearing.
 
Preliminary Issue – Amending the T1 Application:
 
1.     
The Tenant’s agent
requested that the Tenant’s T1 application be amended to include a second
reason for the application –
that the Tenant paid an illegal
damage deposit charge of $675.00 to the Landlord. The agent
submitted that the current reason
for the T1 application lists the
$675.00 as a rent deposit that was not used
for the last rental period of the tenancy. The agent
explained that at the time of
filing the application the Tenant was
not aware that this $675.00 was also
potentially an illegal charge by the Landlord.
 
2.     
The Landlord questioned the Tenant’s ability
to amend the application at the hearing. The Landlord stated that she was prepared to
respond to the Tenant’s allegation that she did not use the $675.00 rent
deposit for the last month’s rent;
however, she was not prepared to
respond to the Tenant’s allegation
that the $675.00 she collected at the start of the tenancy was an illegal charge.
 
3.     
Section 200(1) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') states:
 
An applicant may amend an application to the Board in accordance
with the Rules.
 
4.     
The Board’s Rule 15.4, Amending Applications, states:
 
The LTB may exercise its discretion to grant
a request to amend
made at the hearing
if satisfied the amendment is
appropriate, would not prejudice any
party and is
consistent with a fair and expeditious proceeding.




 
5.     
A T1 is an
application by the Tenant for a
rebate of money that the Landlord
owes. It is clear in the Tenant’s original T1 that the money in dispute is the
Landlord’s collection of
$675.00 at the
start of the tenancy, and the retention of this $675.00 at the end
of the tenancy. The Landlord was prepared to respond to
this allegation.
6.      I am
satisfied that an amendment to the
Tenant’s T1 that adds another reason to the application alleging that the $675.00 was also
an illegal charge does not require
additional preparation by the Landlord to respond
to the allegation. Whether
the $675.00 is identified as a
rent deposit, an illegal charge,
or both in the application – the Landlord’s preparation remains sufficiently similar.
For this reason, I find
that amending the Tenant’s
application at the hearing does not prejudice the Landlord.
7.     
Therefore, I consent
to amending the Tenant’s
T1 application, pursuant to s. 200(1) of the Act and Board
Rule 15.4, by adding the reason
to the application that the Tenant paid an illegal charge of $675.00 to the
Landlord.
 
Determinations:
 
8.     
On July 23, 2020 the Tenant applied to the Board, pursuant to s. 135(1) of the
Act with a T1 application (T1) alleging
that the Landlord
did not use the rent deposit of $675.00 to pay the last month’s rent,
and did not return the rent deposit
to the Tenant at the end of
the tenancy. At the hearing,
the Tenant’s application was amended to also
allege that the Landlord illegally collected the $675.00 deposit.
9.     
The Tenant moved into the unit on August 28, 2019 and paid a deposit of $675.00 to the
Landlord via e-transfer on August 29, 2019. The Tenant moved out of the rental unit on April 25, 2020 and alleges that the Landlord did not use the $675.00 to pay the last
month’s rent, and did not
return the rent deposit to him.
The Tenant filed this application
within one-year of the date that
the money was allegedly collected
and retained illegally pursuant to s. 135(4) of the Act. Therefore, the Tenant’s allegations will be
considered.
 
10.   The monthly rent at the termination of the tenancy
was $700.00.
 
Deposit of $675.00
 
11.  
The Tenant testified that he paid a $675.00
damage deposit to the Landlord via e-transfer
on August 29, 2019. He stated
that after vacating the unit on April
25, 2020, he asked the Landlord on May 4 and 5, 2020 to return the $675.00 damage deposit to him; however, the Landlord retained the money. The Tenant testified further
that the Landlord had retained the deposit because he had
not repaired some scuff marks on the walls of the rental unit. The Tenant remarked that he paid rent
for April 2020, the last month of
the tenancy, and that there were no
rent arrears.
12.  
The Landlord testified that at the start of
the tenancy she requested from the Tenant the first month’s rent of $700.00, and a
damage deposit of $675.00. She stated that she received these funds from the Tenant on August 29, 2019. The
Landlord testified further that the Tenant’s $675.00 deposit was not returned to him
as a result of damage to the
walls of the rental unit that occurred
during the Tenant’s tenancy.




 
13.  
The Landlord explained that she noticed
the damage to the unit walls on April 25, 2020, and that the
Tenant acknowledged the damage
and agreed to complete repairs;
however, the repairs were never completed. The
Landlord remarked that the damage to
the unit walls exceeded
$675.00; therefore, she retained the Tenant’s
deposit. The Landlord
acknowledged that there were no rent arrears when the Tenant vacated the unit on April 25, 2020.
 
Analysis
 
14.   Section 105(1) of the Act states:
 
The only security deposit that a landlord may
collect is a rent deposit
collected in accordance with section 106.
 
15.  
Section 106(10) of the Act states:
 
A landlord shall apply a
rent deposit that a tenant
has paid to the
landlord or to a former landlord in payment of the rent for the
last rent period before the tenancy terminates.
16.  
Section 134(1) of the Act states:
 
(1)     Unless otherwise prescribed, no landlord shall, directly or indirectly, with respect to any rental unit,
 
(a) collect or require or attempt to collect
or require from a tenant,
prospective tenant or former tenant of the rental unit a fee,
premium, commission, bonus,
penalty, key deposit or other like amount of money whether or
not the money is refundable.
 
17.   Section 135(1) of the Act states:
 
A tenant or former tenant of a rental unit may apply to the
Board for an order that the
landlord, superintendent or agent
of the landlord pay to the tenant any money the person collected or
retained in contravention of this Act or the Tenant Protection Act, 1997.
 
18.  
On the basis of the evidence provided, I find that the
Landlord collected a $675.00 deposit from the Tenant on August
29, 2019, and this
deposit was not used for the last month’s rent of
April 2020 pursuant to s. 106(10) of the Act.
19.  
On the basis of the evidence provided, I further find that the $675.00 deposit collected by the Landlord on August 29, 2019 was collected for the purpose of potential damage to the unit by the
Tenant. Collection of a
deposit for this purpose is prohibited by s. 105(1) and
s. 134(1)(a) of the Act, and
is not an exemption to s. 134(1)(a) of the Act pursuant to s.
17 of Ontario Regulation 516/06.
20.  
I
therefore find that the Landlord’s retention of the Tenant’s $675.00
deposit is in
contravention
of the Act, and that the Landlord owes the Tenant $675.00 pursuant to s. 135(1) of the
Act.




 
21.  
The fact that the
Landlord believes that the Tenant caused damage does
not justify the Landlord’s illegal
collection and retention of a damage
deposit. If a landlord believes that a tenant or former tenant has
willfully or negligently caused undue
damage the landlord may file an application at the Board making such a claim.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Landlord shall
pay to the Tenant the sum
of $675.00 representing the money collected
by the Landlord as a damage deposit.
 
2.     
The Landlord shall also pay to the Tenant $53.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
3.     
The total amount the Landlord owes to the Tenant is $728.00.
 
4.      If the Landlord does not
pay the Tenant the full amount
owing by March 31,
2022, the Landlord will owe interest.
This will be simple interest calculated from April 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
 
5.      The Tenant has the right, at any
time, to collect the full
amount owing or any
balance outstanding under this order.
