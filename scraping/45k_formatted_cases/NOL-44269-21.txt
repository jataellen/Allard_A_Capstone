Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44269-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


45 MANITOU STREET NORTH BAY ON P1A1P3


 




Between:


Nipissing District Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Natasha Restoule


Tenant



 
 
 
Nipissing District Housing
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Natasha
Restoule (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant
or another occupant
of the rental unit has
committed an illegal act or has carried out, or permitted someone to carry out
an illegal trade, business or occupation in the rental unit or the residential
complex involving the production of an illegal drug, the trafficking in an
illegal drug or the possession of an illegal drug for the purposes of trafficking.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
988 4914 7021# on February
7, 2022. The Landlord’s
representative Dennis Spencer attended the hearing. Also in attendance as witness for the Landlord was Constable
Blake Vietmeir who testified at the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
On October 5, 2021 police executed
a search warrant at the Tenant’s rental unit. Constable Vietmeir confirmed that
the police seized 28 grams of fentanyl, 10 grams of cocaine, 6 grams of crystal methamphetamine, $5,000.00 in cash as well as suspected drug trafficking equipment and
that this is consistent with trafficking.
 
2.     The estimate street value of the drugs is approximately $13,500.00.
 
3.     The Tenant has been charged
with three counts
of possession for the purpose
of trafficking and one count of possession of property obtained by
crime.
 
4.     I find the Tenant has committed an illegal act involving the possession of an illegal
drug for the purposes of trafficking in the rental unit.
 
5.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.

It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of February
19, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 19, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
February 19, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 20, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 19, 2022, then starting February
20, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
5.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after
February 20, 2022. The Sheriff
is requested to expedite the enforcement of this order.
