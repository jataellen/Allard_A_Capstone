Residential Tenancies Act, 2006

In the matter
of:


LOWER, 210 PARK
STREET N PETERBOROUGH ON
  K9J3P8


 




Between:


Timothy Martyn


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Morgyn
Mcdonald


Tenant



 
 
On October
6, 2021 the Board issued
order TEL-17337-21 terminating the tenancy and evicting
Morgyn Mcdonald (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant failed to pay rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
On November
9, 2021 the Tenant filed a motion
to void order TEL-17337-21 because
after the eviction order
became enforceable, the Tenant paid Timothy Martyn (the 'Landlord') and the
Landlord and the Board the amount required to void the order under subsection
74(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant
has not previously made a motion under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside an eviction order during the
period of the Tenant’s tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
2.    
The order issued on
October 6, 2021 required the Tenant to pay $5,286.00 on or before October 17, 2021 to void
the order. As of November
9, 2021, the date
the Tenant filed her motion,
the rent for November 2021 came due bringing the amount due and owing to
$6,486.00, since the rent is $1,200.00.
 
3.    
The Tenant’s affidavit
states five payments were made to the Landlord after the order’s enforceable date in
the following amounts:
$1,200.00 on August
31, 2021, $1,200.00 on November 1, 2021, $1,200.00 on November 1, 2021, $1,200.00
on November 2, 2021 and $186.00 on November 3, 2021. A further payment was made
to the Board on November 9, 2021 in the amount of $1,500.00.
 
4.    
At the hearing, the
Landlord confirmed the receipt of the five payments. The Board’s records confirm that a $1,500.00 payment
made by the Tenant to the Board
is being held in trust.

5.    
Based on the evidence
before the Board, I find that the Tenant has voided the order dated October
6, 2021 at the time she filed her motion to void and thus, the motion to
void the order issued on October 6, 2021 must be granted.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The motion
to void order
TEL-17337-21 is granted.
 
2.    
Order TEL-17337-21 is void and cannot be enforced by the Landlord.
 
3.    
The Board
shall pay to the Landlord
the amount of $1,500.00 together
with any accrued interest. **
