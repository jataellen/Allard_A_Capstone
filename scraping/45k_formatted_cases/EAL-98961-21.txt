File Number: EAL-98961-21
 
 
In the matter of:      7, 123 DOMINION
STREET SOUTH
ALEXANDRIA ON K0C1A0
 
Between:                  Wendy Perry                                    Landlord
 
 
and
 




Krystale Lee Jones Saucier Patrick Viau


Tenants




 
 
 
On November 22, 2021,
Wendy Perry (the 'Landlord') applied
in this L3 application for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Krystale Lee Jones Saucier and Patrick Viau
(the 'Tenants') because the Tenants entered into an agreement to terminate the
tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    The
Landlord and the Tenants signed
an N11 Agreement to End the Tenancy
form with effective
termination date November 30, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 15, 2022 (standard 11
days from the issuance date of this order).
 
2.       
Since the Landlord applied for
this order before the termination date in the N11 (instead of after the
termination date had passed if the Tenants
failed to move out), the cost of the application filing fee will not be
imposed on the Tenants.
 
3.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
4.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 16, 2022.

filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that
has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
