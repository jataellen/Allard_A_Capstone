Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-34218-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


907, 188 DORIS AVENUE TORONTO ON M2N6Z5


 




Between:


Zexi Tian


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Pooya Elishaee Sayad Sogol Entezari Heravi


Tenants



 
 
 
Zexi Tian (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Sogol Entezari Heravi and Pooya Elishaee
Sayad (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on November 29, 2021 at 9:54am. The Landlord
Zexi Tan and one Tenant Pooya Elishaee Sayad
attended the hearing.
 
At the hearing the Tenants raised the following
issues pursuant to section 82 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'):
1.     Building air
conditioner was out of
use due to scheduled
maintenance / cleaning.
 
 
Determinations:
1.    
The Tenants have
not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from June 1, 2021 to December
31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective July 25, 2021.
2.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $2,200.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
3.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from October 25, 2020 to
July 25, 2021.




 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tenant Submissions
 
 
4.     The Tenant was without the use of the
building air conditioning service for 5 days, during which time the Landlord
made reasonable efforts
to accommodate the Tenant by offering to buy a portable unit until the
service was resumed.
5.     The
Tenant purchased a unit through
Amazon, and the Landlord was going to reimburse
the Tenant for the purchase.
6.     The
building air conditioning service
was restored to use quickly,
and the Tenant did not need to use the new air conditioner unit that was purchased.
7.    
The Tenant
returned the portable air conditioner unit to Amazon, and the Tenant was asking for a rebate
of $30, which represents the cost of shipping the Tenant paid to return the new air conditioner unit to
Amazon.
 
 
Landlord Submissions
 
 
8.    
The Landlord
submitted that she had no control over the air conditioner in the building
being shut down for scheduled maintenance, and offered to reimburse the Tenant for the purchase of a portable air
conditioner unit to use while the maintenance was ongoing.
9.    
The Landlord submitted that she offered to pay for the
shipping of the air conditioner unit on several occasions with the submission of a receipt or
proof of shipping from the Tenant.
10.  The Tenant had failed
to provide such receipt and the Landlord
did not pay the shipping.
 
 
Findings and Analysis
 
 
11.  During the hearing
the Tenant did not dispute the arrears.
12. 
During the
hearing the Landlord submitted that she would consent to a rebate of $30.00
towards the arrears as compensation for the out of pocket shipping
costs the Tenant paid to return the portable air
conditioner unit to Amazon.
13. 
During the hearing the parties agreed
that the Landlord
will rebate $30.00
to the Tenant towards the original arrears filed in the application.




 
14.  I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of
the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find
that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
 
It is ordered
that:
 
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant
voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 25, 2022.
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$13,041.90*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February
14, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit and less the amount of the, $30.00 rebate for the shipping of the
returned air conditioner unit to Amazon, the Landlord owes the Tenants.
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $72.33 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 15, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
25, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 26, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 25, 2022, then starting February
26, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 26, 2022.
8.    
If, on or before
February 25, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $16,466.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.    
The Tenants
may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 26, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
