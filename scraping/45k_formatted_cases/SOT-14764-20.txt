Order under Section
31
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: SOT-14764-20
 



In the matter
of:


MASTER, 32 ANN STREET
  WELLAND ON L3C3S4


 




Between:


Qasim Vawda


Tenant




 


and


 




 


Lynn Kennedy


Landlord



 
Qasim Vawda (the
'Tenant') applied for an order determining that Lynn Kennedy
(the 'Landlord') or the Landlord's superintendent or the Landlord's agent
harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with the Tenant and
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental
unit or residential complex by the Tenant or by a member
of the Tenant's household.
This application was heard via video/teleconference on September 22, 2021.
 
Only the Tenant
attended the hearing. As of 11:14
a.m., the Landlord was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant claims the Landlord harassed
and substantially interfered with the Tenants’ reasonable enjoyment of the
rental rent when the Landlord confronted and asked the Tenant to move out of the rental unit because the Tenant on a number of occasion was inviting guests over and into the
rental unit/residential complex during the period of the COVID pandemic stay at
home provincial public health directive.
 
2.    
The Tenant
moved out of the rental
unit on April 28, 2020 and is seeking
return of alleged prepaid rent and a last month
rent deposit. The application filed is for harassment and substantial
interference, not that the Landlord collected or retained money illegally.
 
3.    
Section 37(1) of the Residential Tenancies
Act states: “A tenancy may be terminated only in accordance with this Act”.
 
4.    
Subsection 37(2) of
the Act states: “If a notice of termination is given in accordance with this Act and the tenant vacates
the rental unit in accordance with the notice,
the tenancy is terminated on
the termination date set out in the notice”
 
5.    
Subsection 37(3) of the Act states:
“A notice of termination need not be given if a landlord and a tenant have agreed to
terminate a tenancy”.

6.    
Despite being asked to
leave and move out of the unit by the Landlord, neither parties officially gave the other notice to terminate the tenancy in accordance with the Act and
no documentary evidence was submitted that there was an agreement to end
the tenancy.
 
7.    
I find the tenancy
was not terminated in accordance with any provision of the Residential Tenancies Act.
 
8.    
Section 88 says that where a tenant vacates
without giving a valid notice of termination, the tenant’s liability for
rent ends on the earliest date the tenant could have given valid notice for, or
when a new tenant moves in, subject to the landlord’s duty to mitigate.
 
9.    
In this instance, the tenancy agreement is month to month.
 
10.  Without
being given a valid notice
to terminate the tenancy, the Landlord would
not have been effectively
able to mitigate.
 
11. 
I find the Tenant vacated the rental unit on
April 28, 2020 without notice to
the Landlord and without
a binding agreement to terminate the tenancy having
been entered with the
Landlord.
 
12.  I find the Landlord has not harassed the
Tenant and/or substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the
rental unit or residential complex by the Tenant. It is my view, that the Landlord
had legitimate concerns
that the Tenant
was inviting guests
over and into the rental unit/residential complex during the period of
the COVID pandemic contrary to the stay at home provincial public health
directive.
 
13.  The Tenant’s claim for return
of money paid to the Landlord are the basis of a T1
application, and no determination is made on that claim.
 
14.  The Landlord did not attend the hearing
to make submissions.
 
It is ordered that:
 
15.  The Tenant’s application is dismissed.
