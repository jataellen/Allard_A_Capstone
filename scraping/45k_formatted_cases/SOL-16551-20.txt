Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-16551-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


LOWER, 46 HOWARD
STREET HAGERSVILLE ON N0A1H0


 




Between:


Dennis Smith


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Paul Thompson
  Whitney Mason


Tenants



 
 
 
Dennis Smith
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Paul
Thompson and Whitney Mason (the 'Tenants') because
they, another occupant
of the rental unit or
someone they permitted in the residential complex have substantially interfered
with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or
interest of the Landlord or another
tenant. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 29, 2021. Only the Landlord
attended the hearing. As of
11:35 a.m. the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing as it appears from the Certificate
of Service.
 
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.    
The application is based on a voidable
Notice of Termination served on the Tenants on August 17, 2020 with a termination
date of September 6, 2020 because the Tenants failed to pay utilities in the
amount of $ 1,400.00.
 
2.    
The Board has no
jurisdiction to award the cost of the outstanding utilities unless the
utilities are included in the rent, in which case they became
rent owing. In this
case the utilities are
charged separately from the rent at a cost of $175.00 per month.
 
3.    
The Landlord,
in addition to costs, is seeking eviction,
however the Tenants
moved out of the rental unit on May 11, 2021. Therefore, there is no eviction for the
Board to order.
 
4.    
The application is dismissed.
