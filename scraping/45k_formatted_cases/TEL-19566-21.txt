Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19566-21



In the matter
of:


107, 254 MCDONNEL STREET PETERBOROUGH ON K9H2W3


 




Between:


2731233 Ontario Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Cheyenne Stanton


 
Tenant



 
 
2731233 Ontario Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Cheyenne Stanton (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video
conference on January
5, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Rajan Mahavalirajan, attended
the hearing. As of 9:57
a.m. the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing by
the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
July 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August
19, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
3.    
The lawful monthly rent is $500.00.
4.    
The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed.
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $440.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from March 6, 2020 to December 31, 2020.
 
7.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with section 83 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19
on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenant, and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.

It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before February 6,
2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,994.75*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
26, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $16.44
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 27, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
6, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 7, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 6, 2022, then starting
February 7, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 7, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$3,701.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022,
or
ii)             
$4,201.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 6, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 7, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
