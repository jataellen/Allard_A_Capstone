Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-87732-18










 
 

A.K.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict S.G.
and S.E. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.  This is an L1 application.
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenants because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they
permitted in the residential complex have wilfully or negligently caused undue
damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring
the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the damage; and because they or
another occupant of the rental unit have committed an illegal act or have
carried out, or permitted someone to carry out an illegal trade, business or
occupation in the rental unit or the residential complex involving the
production of an illegal drug, the trafficking in an illegal drug or the
possession of an illegal drug for the purposes of trafficking. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after
the termination date.  This is an L2 application.
 
This
application was heard in Whitby on February 16, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
1.     At
the commencement of the hearing, I brought forward a preliminary issue
regarding the termination date on the Notice of Termination for Illegal Act
(‘N6’).  The termination date set out in the N6 is November 30, 2017.  The date
the Landlord filed the application is January 19, 2018.
2.     Subsection
46 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) states,
(1) A notice of termination becomes void 30
days after the termination date specified in the notice unless,
            (a) the tenant vacates the
rental unit before that time; or
            (b) the landlord applies for an
order terminating the tenancy and
                 evicting the tenant before
that time
3.     Here,
the Tenants did not vacate and the Landlord did not apply to the Board within
the 30 day period.  For this reason, the Landlord’s application pertaining to
illegal act is void and must be dismissed.
APPLICATION
FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
4.     The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from January 1, 2018 to February 28, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective January 18, 2018.
5.     The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $790.00 from the Tenants and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
6.     Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from September 4,
2015 to January 18, 2018.
APPLICATION
FOR DAMAGES
7.     The
Landlord served the Tenants with a first Notice of Termination under sections 62
and 64 of the Act (‘N5’) on November 9, 2017.  When this N5 was issued the
legislation required the Tenants to fix the issue within 7 days of service in
order to void the notice.  
8.     The
Landlord did not apply to the Board based on this first notice, but served the
Tenants a second Notice of Termination on January 14, 2018 for damages.  This
means the first N5 need not be void under the change in provision 68 of the
Act.  As a result, the application proceeded on the second N5 for damages
only.  The Landlord also applied for damages in the application.  
9.     The
Landlord testified that the Tenants had a domestic fight on October 23, 2017, which
spilled out into the hallway and they broke the fire rated glass door window,
the Tenants’ door and blood was found all over the hallway walls, stairs and
windows.  The police attended this incident.  The Landlord submitted pictures
and an invoice of the damage claim in the amount of $2,045.30; however, the
Landlord’s application claims $1,500.00. I find the Landlord’s claimed amount
of $1,500.00 to be reasonable and is granted.
10.  The
Tenants had another domestic dispute, which again entered the hallway where the
Tenants broke the fire glass door window a second time.  The Landlord’s second
N5 claims this damage in the amount of $380.00 even though the invoice for the
glass has a total of $395.50.  The amount of $380.00 is granted and termination
of the tenancy is based on this N5 notice.
11.  Given all
of the above, I am satisfied the Tenants have wilfully
or negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit and residential complex. 

12.  I have
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1)
of the Act.
13.  This
order contains all of the reasons for my decision within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.  
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before April 3, 2018.
2.     The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $770.61*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to March 23, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $1,880.00 for damages caused to the
rental unit and residential complex.
4.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $26.63 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting March 24, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
5.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
6.     If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before April
3, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from April 4, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
7.     If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 3, 2018, then starting April 4,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 4, 2018.
