In the
  matter of:


B, 1201
SECOND STREET EAST
STREET E CITY OF CORNWALL
  ON K6H2B3


 




Between:


830316 Ontario
Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Sean Coughlan


Tenant



 
 
 
830316 Ontario Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sean Coughlan (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 18, 2022. Only Gary Jans, Officer of the Corporation attended the hearing. As of 9:22 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
The Landlord requested relief from eviction
for the Tenant and asked that the Board consider
a repayment plan rather than terminating the Tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the total
rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from April 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective September 24, 2021.
 
2.      The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.      The application is amended to reflect the monthly rent as of $765.00.
 
4.      As of February
1, 2022, the monthly rent for the unit
will be $780.00.
 
5.      The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
6.      The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
 
7.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') including the impact of COVID-
19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenant and, find that it would not be unfair to grant relief
from

eviction subject to the conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$7,836.00, which represents the arrears of rent
$7,650.00, and costs $186.00
outstanding for the period ending
January 31, 2022.
 
2.     The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant is denied
on the condition that:
 
(a) 
The Tenant shall make the following
payments to the Landlord in respect of the
monies owing under paragraph 1 of this order:
 
•        
On or before February
10, 2022 the Tenant shall
pay $217.66 plus the
February 2022 rent.
 
•        
On or before the first of the month
the Tenant shall pay monthly
$217.66 commencing on March 1, 2022 to January
1, 2025 or until the arrears owing under this order are
paid in full.
 
(b) 
The Tenant shall also pay the Landlord the rent for the months
of March 2022 up to and including January 2025 in full,
on or before the first day of each corresponding month during the arrears
repayment period.
 
3.    
If the Tenant fails
to make any of the payments in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates required, then:
 
(a)  The Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’) for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, and for
the payment of any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not already ordered
under paragraph 1 of this order. The Landlord must make the application within
30 days of a breach of a condition set out in paragraph 2 of this order.
 
(b)  The balance owing under paragraph
1 of this order shall
become payable on the
day following the date of default. The monies owing shall bear interest at the post- judgment interest rate determined
under subsection 207(7) of the Act.
