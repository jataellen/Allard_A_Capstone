Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-20320-19
 











 
 
 

PPL (the 'Landlord') applied for
an order to terminate the tenancy and evict JM and JA (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenants because they have been persistently late in
paying their rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on December 6,
2019.
 
Only the Landlord’s legal
representative, SK, attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
 
L1 application:
 
1.     
The Tenants did not attend
the hearing.  I was satisfied that the Tenants were served the Notice of
Hearing, so I proceeded to hear the matter on an uncontested basis.
 
2.     
The Tenants paid the
Landlord the amount of rent that is in arrears under the tenancy agreement, any
additional rent that would have been due under the tenancy agreement on the
date of the Tenants' payment, and the filing fee for this application to
November 30, 2019.
 
3.     
The Landlord's application
relating to eviction of the Tenants based on arrears of rent is discontinued to
November 30, 2019. 
L2 application:
 
4.     
The Tenants have
persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
5.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,069.98 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
 
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from May 1, 2018 to November 30, 2019.
 
7.     
The Landlord is seeking
non-remedial termination.
 
8.     
The Landlord’s legal
representative said that the Tenants continued to pay the rent late after
receiving the N8 Notice of Termination.  In addition, he said that the Tenants
still owe over $900.00 balance on the rent for December, 2019, as of the date
of the hearing.
 
9.     
The Landlord’s legal
representative said that the Tenants were previously evicted from the rental
unit, and he submitted into evidence a delivery of vacant possession from the
Tenants from 2013.
 
10.  
The Landlord’s legal
representative submits that the Tenants have failed to pay the rent on time for
a substantial period of time.
 
11.  
I find, on the uncontested
evidence of the Landlord, that the Tenants have paid the rent persistently late
for at least two years.  They currently owe a substantial balance on the rent
for December, 2019.
 
12.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find, based on the above, that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
the Act.  There is no evidence that the Tenants have the intention to pay the
rent on time, going forward.  I find that it is prejudicial to the Landlord to
have the tenancy continue.  There is a last month rent deposit, so I find that
it is not unfair to postpone the eviction to January 31, 2020.
It is ordered that:
 
L1 application:
 
1.     
The Landlord’s L1
application is discontinued.
 
L2 application:
 
2.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenants is terminated, as of January 31, 2020. The Tenants
must move out of the rental unit on or before January 31, 2020.
 
3.     
If the Tenants do not move
out of the rental unit on or before January 31, 2020, the Tenants shall pay to
the Landlord $35.88 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from February
1, 2020 to the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2020, then starting February 1, 2020, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
5.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after February 1, 2020.
