Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: CEL-03229-21
 
In the matter of:      2602, 4065 CONFEDERATION PARKWAY
MISSISSAUGA ON L5B4N1
 




Between:                  Suzy Quintal John Medeiros


Landlords




 
 
and
 




Abdulrahman Zeidalkilani Anita Piwowarek


Tenants




 
 
Suzy Quintal and John Medeiros
(the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Anita Piwowarek and Abdulrahman Zeidalkilani (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 24, 2022. Only the Landlord, John Medeiros, attended
the hearing. As of 2:47 p.m.,
the Tenants were not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent
the Tenants were required to pay for the period from August 15, 2021 to February
14, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective September 11, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,800.00.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,800.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from June 17, 2021 to
September 11, 2021.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 11, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $8,260.12*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 31, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlords
$59.18 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 1, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before February
11, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 12, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 11, 2022, then starting
February 12, 2022, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 12, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 11, 2022, the Tenants pay
the amount of $11,001.00** to the Landlords or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 12, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during
the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
