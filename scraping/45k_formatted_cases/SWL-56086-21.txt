Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-56086-21



In the
  matter of:


417, 55 CARTIER ROAD LONDON ON N5V1G4


 




Between:


Skyline Living


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Marco Bailey


 
Tenant



 
 
Skyline Living (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Marco Bailey (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 3, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Terry
Medeiros, attended the hearing.
As of 9:59 a.m. the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from April 1, 2020 to November 30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective October 8, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on November
24, 2021. The Tenant was in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
3.    
The lawful monthly rent was $989.67.
4.    
The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed.
5.    
The NSF charges claimed
by the Landlord related to electronic fund transfers rather
than NSF cheques. Since subsection 87(5) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006, does not provide a remedy for electronic fund transfers that
fail due to non-sufficient funds, the Landlord’s claim for NSF charges is
denied.
 
6.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $989.67
from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
has been paid to the Tenant up to September 30, 2021.




File Number: SWL-56086-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy is terminated as of November
24, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $13,694.33*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to November 24, 2021, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March 7, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from March 8, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
