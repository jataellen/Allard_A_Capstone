Order under Section 135
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOT-42563-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


DOWNSTAIRS, 213
ALBERT STREET HAILEYBURY ON
  P0J1K0


 




Between:


Kelly Hewitt


Tenant




 


 
and


 




 


Miller Realty
  Linda Miller


Landlords



 
 
 
Kelly Hewitt (the 'Tenant') applied for an order determining that Linda Miller
and Miller Realty
(the 'Landlords') have collected or retained money illegally.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 18, 2021.
The Tenant and one of the Landlords attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlords failed to pay the Tenant compensation for termination of the tenancy
due to the purchaser’s own use of the rental unit, as required by the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').
 
2.     The Landlords sold the residential complex. The Landlords gave the Tenant a notice of
termination on behalf
of the purchaser and the Tenant moved
out of the rental on January
31, 2021, in accordance with the notice.
 
3.    
The Landlords refused to pay the equivalent of one month’s
rent as compensation, claiming that the Tenant owed rent because her
“roommate” did not pay rent.
 
4.     The Tenant did not owe rent. She was up to date with
her rent. The Tenant rented the lower unit from the Landlords and the lease was
not amended to include the whole house. The upper unit was a self-contained unit that had always been rented separately to other tenants. The Tenant’s friend rented the upper unit
when it became empty and the Tenant collected the rent for the Landlord. The Tenant was never obligated to pay rent
for the upper unit.

owing by March 5, 2022, the Landlords will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 6, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
 
5.     The Tenant has the right, at any time, to collect the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
