Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-09473-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


509 NORDMANN FIR COURT
  STITTSVILLE ON K2V0N5


 




Between:


Ekta Bangur Ayushya
Bangur


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Jordan Giberson


Tenant



 
 
 
Ekta Bangur and Ayushya Bangur
(the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jordan Giberson
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on November
23, 2021.
 
The Landlords and the Tenant attended
the hearing. The Landlords were represented by B. Di Lisi.
 
The Tenant requested an
adjournment because the Landlord provided the L1/L9 Information Update two days
before the hearing instead of five days before the hearing, and because he
needed more time to make a counterclaim. I
denied the request. The hearing was
previously adjourned because there
was not enough time in the hearing
block to hear the matter.
An update was provided at
that time. The Tenant submitted rent
receipts before the hearing. Thus, the Tenant was able to dispute the arrears
if he so desired. I also permitted
the Tenant to submit evidence of payments after the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     After the application was filed the Tenant
attempted to sublet
the rental unit to Tracy Pyett
(TP). TP wanted to take over the
lease, but the Landlords refused to approve the sublet or assignment. The Tenant did not give notice to
terminate the tenancy based on the Landlords’
refusal or apply to the Board for a remedy. The Landlords subsequently made
the Tenant an offer to terminate the tenancy, but the Tenant rejected the
offer.
 
2.     The Tenant claimed
the Landlord accepted
rent from TP, but the payments were made by email transfer. The Landlords were
enrolled in a auto-deposit program. Once
the Landlords determined the source of the funds, they discontinued the
auto-deposit. I find




 
that the Landlords did not agree to the transfer of the lease.
The Tenant continued to have the utilities in his name.
 
3.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period
from December 1, 2020 to November
30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords
served a Notice of Termination effective January 31, 2021.
 
4.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,925.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from March 20, 2020 to January 31, 2021.
 
6.    
The Tenant paid $5,200.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), including the impact of the pandemic and whether the Landlord
attempted to negotiate a payment plan, and find that it would be unfair to
grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords
and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 16, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $19,702.21*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 11, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $63.29 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 12,
2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing* on or before February 22, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 23, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 16, 2022, then starting
February 17, 2022, the Landlords may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 17, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before February 16,
2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $23,042.86** to the Landlords or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the




 
tenancy would not be terminated,
and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that
the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after February 17, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
