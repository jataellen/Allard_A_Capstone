Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-95548-18
 










 
 

M.M
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict J.D.K (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (“the L1
application”).
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant another occupant of the rental unit or someone the
Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with
the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord
or another tenant (“the L2 application”).
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on June 28, 2018.
 
Only
the Landlord and the Landlord’s representative, his son, D.M (“DM”) attended the
hearing.
 
The
Tenant did not attend the hearing although I was satisfied that the Tenant
received proper notice of the time, date and location of the hearing. 
Nonetheless, I waited until after 10 a.m.  When the Tenant still did not
arrive, I proceeded to hear the Landlord’s applications.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant remains in possession of the residential unit.
2.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from January 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective May 12, 2018.
3.      With
respect to the L1 application, at the hearing, DM provided a written summary of
the Landlord’s financial claims, showing arrears of rent as of the hearing date
of $9,000.00 plus a claim for $190.00 for the filing fee.   The Landlord’s
total L1 claim at the hearing was $9,190.00. 
4.      With
respect to the L2 application, the Landlord served the Tenant with an N5 Notice
of Termination on April 27, 2018 (“the N5”).
 
5.      On a Form N5, a
tenant is afforded the opportunity to void the notice by correcting the
offensive behaviour or stopping the activity within seven days of being served
with the Form N5. In this particular case, the voiding period was from April 28
2018 to May 4, 2018 inclusive. The Landlord alleges the Tenants did not void
the Form N5 within the seven-day period permitted by subsection 64(3) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) and has not corrected the problem to date.
 
6.      The
N5 sets out one principal issue, the Tenant’s failure to reimburse the Landlord
for utilities charges since October 2017.
 
7.      DM
submitted into evidence the lease agreement between the parties dated June 15,
2015.  Under the lease, the Tenant agreed to pay the electricity, gas and water
charges for the unit. 
 
8.      DM
testified that despite this agreement, and despite being provided copies of the
invoices for utilities since October 2017 (most of which were submitted into
evidence at the hearing), the Tenant has not paid any of these utilities
charges from October 2017 to date.
 
9.      Based
upon the uncontested evidence before me, I find that the Tenant’s payment for
utilities for the unit was a term of the tenancy agreement.
 
10.   DM
described that the Landlord’s efforts to communicate with the Tenant about this
situation have gone without a response from the Tenant.
 
11.   DM
confirmed that since the service of the N5, the Tenant has not made any further
payments toward utilities to date.  
 
12.   In
failing to pay for utilities charges since October 2017 and continuing to date,
the Tenant has breached a term of the tenancy agreement.
 
13.   Pursuant to Stanbar Properties
v. Rooke, [2005] O.J. No. 6363 (On. Div. Ct.),
breach of a lease term constitutes interference with the Landlord’s lawful
right. 
 
14.  
Based
upon the sworn and uncontradicted evidence provided at the hearing, I find, on
a balance of probabilities that the Tenant has substantially interfered with
the Landlord’s lawful right, privilege or interest.
 
15.  
I
find that the Tenant did not void the N5 notice by correcting this breach of
the tenancy agreement (by paying for utilities charges) during the voiding
period stated above.
 
16.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
L1 application
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below (subject to the L2 portion of this
order below), the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. 
The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before July 15, 2018.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $9,205.74*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to July 4, 2018.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $49.32 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting July 5, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before July
15, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from July 16, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before July 15, 2018, then starting July 16,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 16, 2018.
8.      If,
on or before July 15, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $10,690.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, the L1 portion of this order for eviction
will be void (subject to the L2 portion of this order below).  This means that
the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit (subject
to the L2 portion of this order below).  If this payment is not made in full
and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside the L1 portion of this order (subject to the L2 portion of this order
below) if the Tenant pays the amount required under that subsection on or after
July 16, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
L2
application
10.   If
the Tenant pays the amount set out in paragraph 8 above to void the L1 portion
of this order, the tenancy shall continue to July 15, 2018 on which date the
tenancy is terminated based upon substantial interference with the lawful right
or interest of the Landlord. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before July 15, 2018.
11.   If
the unit is not vacated on or before July 15, 2018, then starting July 16,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
12.   Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after July 16, 2018.
