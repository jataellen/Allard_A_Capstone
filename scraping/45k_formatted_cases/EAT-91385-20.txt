Tania Sewell
(the 'Sub Tenant')
applied for an order to determine whether
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') applies (A1
application).
 
Tania Sewell (the 'Sub Tenant') applied
for an order determining that Kimisa Bradshaw
and Medallion Corporation (the 'Landlords') have collected or retained
money illegally (T1 Application).
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on December
8, 2021. Marija
Pavic attended on behalf of Medallion Corporation (‘Medallion’). Kimisa Bradshaw (‘KB’) attended
the hearing with her Legal Representative, Frank
Loreto. Tania Sewell
(‘TS’) attended the hearing with her Legal Representative, Tiona Gentles.
Filipa Amaral (‘FA’) attended the hearing as a witness for Medallion.
 
Determinations:
 
Overview
 
1.   
The rental unit was rented by
Medallion Corporation (‘Medallion’) to KB. KB then entered into a subtenancy agreement with TS without the consent of Medallion. Under the terms
of the subtenancy agreement, TS agreed to pay KB $1,700.00 monthly
rent. KB moved out of the rental unit and TS moved in on or
around January 15, 2020. TS alleges that KB charged her more than the lawful
monthly rent that KB was required to pay to Medallion. Accordingly, TS files
this application to determine whether the Act applies and, if so, the return of
the illegal charges.
 
2.   
Medallion and KB take the position
that the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) does not apply and therefore the
Board does not have jurisdiction over the matter. TS takes the position that
the Act does apply.




 
A1 application: does the Act apply?
 
3.    
For the reasons below, I find that the Act does not apply.
Therefore, the Board
does not have jurisdiction and
the T1 application must be dismissed.
 
4.    
The evidence before me establishes that TS was not a tenant, or a subtenant as defined by the
Act.
 
5.     Section 2(1) of the Act defines states:
 
“tenant” includes a person who pays rent in return for the right to occupy
a rental unit .
. .
 
“subtenant” means
the person to whom a tenant gives
the right under
section 97 to occupy a rental unit.
 
6.   
Section 97(1) of the Act states
that a tenant may sublet a rental
unit to another
person with the consent of the landlord.
 
7.   
In this case, TS did
not have the right to occupy the rental unit as explained
below. KB was the tenant.
Medallion did not consent to KB subletting the rental unit to TS. Therefore, TS
was not a subtenant as defined by the Act. Rather, she was an unauthorized
occupant.
 
8.   
Section 100 of the Act deals with unauthorized occupancy. It states:
 
(1)  If a tenant transfers the
occupancy of a rental unit to a
person in a manner other than by an assignment authorized under section 95 or a
subletting authorized under section 97, the landlord may apply to the Board for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting
the tenant and the person to whom occupancy of the rental unit was transferred.
 
(2)  TIME LIMITATION – An application under subsection (1) must be made no later than 60 days after the landlord discovers the
unauthorized occupancy.
 
9.  Subsection 104(4) of the Act provides that:
 
A person’s occupation of a rental
unit shall be deemed to be an assignment of the rental
unit with the consent of the landlord as of the date the unauthorized
occupancy began if,
 
(a)  
a tenancy agreement is not entered
into under subsection (1) or (2) within the period set out in subsection (3);
 
(b)  
the landlord does not apply to the Board under section 100 for an order evicting the person within 60 days of the
landlord discovering the unauthorized occupancy; and
 
(c)  
neither the landlord
nor the tenant applies to the Board
under section 101 within
60 days after the end of the subtenancy for an order evicting the subtenant.
 
10.  Medallion discovered the unauthorized occupancy on
August 5, 2020 and filed an A2 application to terminate the tenancy and evict TS (an unauthorized occupant) on October




 
1, 2020. This was done within the
60-day limitation period. TS eventually moved out of the rental unit prior to a hearing before
the Board. Accordingly, I find that that there was no deemed assignment of the tenancy
pursuant to subsection 104(4) of the Act.
 
11.  The Act does not provide an unauthorized occupant to
bring an application before the Board. Therefore, TS has no standing. Her claim against
KB may lie in a different forum.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The T1 application is dismissed.
