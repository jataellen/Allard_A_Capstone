  Ouellette


Tenants



 
 
 
Cinda Gault and Naomi Blackman (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Kim
Ouellette and Troy Ouellette (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the
rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 1, 2022. Only the Landlords attended the hearing. As of 10:04 a.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from May 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of
Termination effective October 4, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on October
6, 2021. The Tenants were in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,040.40.
 
4.    
The Landlords are not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of October
6, 2021, the date the Tenants gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlords.




File Number: SOL-25308-21
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $5,407.22*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to October 6, 2021.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $201.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before
February 18, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
