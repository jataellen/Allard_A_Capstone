In the matter
of:

Between:


Greenboard Holdings Ltd


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Benita
Ehiaguina


Tenant



 
 
 
Greenboard
Holdings Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Benita Ehiaguina (the 'Tenant') because he, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone he permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or
negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage;
and because he, another occupant of the rental unit or someone he permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another
tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on October 14, 2021. The Landlord’s Agent, Marieta Tamayo and the Landlord’s
Representative, Jason Paine, attended the hearing. As of 10:03 a.m. the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with
notice of this hearing as it appears from the Certificate of Service.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The application is
based on a voidable Notice of Termination (form N5) served on the Tenant on May 26, 2020, with a termination date of June 25, 2020 because the Tenant or an occupant of the rental unit or a
person permitted in the residential complex by the Tenant had wilfully or
negligently caused undue damage to the rental by breaking the bathroom vanity,
the pedestal sink and the bath spout.
 
2.    
The N5 required the
Tenant pay the $1,644.44 for the repairs within seven days. The voiding period was May 27, 2020 to June 3, 2020. The Tenant
failed to pay the Landlord within the seven days, so the
Landlord filed the application to evict the Tenant.
 
3.    
The damage was
discovered as a result a service call to repair the bath spout. At that time, it was determined the damage had occurred as a result
of someone standing
on the spout causing water to
leak into the unit, below. While the
repairs were taking place, the damage to the vanity and pedestal sink were
noted.

4.    
As the Tenant moved out
of the rental unit on August 26, 2020, the request to evict the Tenant is moot. On August 30, 2020 the Landlord received
an estimate to repair further damage to the unit in the amount of $3,644.82. In anticipation of the Case Management Hearing (CMH), the
Landlord filed a request to amend the application to reflect the new damage on
January 12, 2021, five months after the damage was discovered.
 
5.    
Although the Tenant or
their guests may be responsible for the damages added to the total of the original
application, the damage
was not discovered until after the Tenant
had vacated the unit.
 
6.    
S 89 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, (the ‘Act’) provides
that a landlord may seek the cost of damages only when the
tenant is in possession of the rental unit. At
the time the original application was filed the other damage had not yet
occurred. To permit the Landlord to
amend the application to reflect new damage without the Tenant having an
opportunity to address the damage would be unfairly prejudicial to the Tenant. Because the damage was discovered after
the Tenant vacated the rental unit, and because the Tenant did not attend the
CMH, or the hearing, and moved without leaving a forwarding address I am not
satisfied the Tenant has had a reasonable opportunity to address the increased
costs and new damage being claimed by the Landlord.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
August 26, 2020 the date the Tenant gave vacant possession of the rental
unit to the Landlord.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$1,644.44, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage and/or
replacing the damaged property.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the
full amount owing on or before January 15, 2022, he will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January
16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
