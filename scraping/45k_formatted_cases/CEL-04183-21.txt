On November 15,
2021, Tania Boffo and Robert Boffo (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Holly Kirk (Coles) (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued
by the Board on February 3, 2021 with respect to application CEL-93518-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlords could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant if
the Tenant did not meet certain
condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed to repair
and/or replace the existing garage door at her own expense ensuring
that the door is undamaged and fully operational, on or before October 31, 2021.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlords and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 18, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January
19, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after January 19, 2022.
