Grey Bruce
Property Rentals Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Gagandeep Singh (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Andy Timmerman, attended
the hearing. As of 11:35 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period
from August 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 3, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on
October 31, 2021. The Tenant
was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was
filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $950.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $950.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 25, 2020 to September 3, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $1,200.00 after the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of October
31, 2021, the date the Tenant returned
vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.




File Number: CEL-02661-21
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $3,453.91*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to October
31, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the
full amount owing* on or before April 30, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from May 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
