Colleen Santos-Amalu (The ‘Tenant’) applied
for an order determining that (the 'Landlord') failed to meet the Landlord's maintenance obligations under the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') or failed to comply with health, safety,
housing or maintenance standards (T6 Application).
 
This hearing was held via video teleconference on November 1, 2021.
 
The Tenant Colleen
Santos-Amalu (CS), the Landlord Shirley
Clifford (CL), the Landlord’s
witness Jennifer Los and the Landlord’s Legal
Representative, Thomas Schoenleber (TS) attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
TS questioned that why
Sylvester Amalu (SA), is named as a Tenant in this application. The Tenant CS confirmed
that SA was an occupant.
An occupant cannot file an application
against a landlord. Therefore, the application is amended to remove SA as a party.
 
2.     
The rental
unit is a one-bedroom apartment located in a house that contains
two apartments in total. The subject rental unit is the upper unit.
 
3.

The Tenant
alleges that the rental unit was not in a good state of repair at the beginning of the
tenancy. The Tenant informed the Landlord about the extensive
repairs required in the
rental unit. More specifically, in the kitchen, the living room and the
bathroom.
 
5.      The parties entered
into a tenancy agreement with a start date of December 1, 2020.




 
6.     
The Tenant informed the
Landlord that she will be out of the country until January 10, 2021. The Landlord agreed
to allow the Tenant’s
friend ‘Eme’ to move the Tenant’s dog and belongings into the rental unit on
November 27, 2020.
 
7.     
However, ‘Eme’ could
not completely move into the rental unit on November 27, 2020 because the previous tenant
did not completely move out of the rental unit. The rental
unit was also in unliveable condition with garbage everywhere. The
Tenant’s friend immediately informed the Tenant about the condition of the
rental unit.
 
8.     
On November
30, 2020, the Tenant sent a text message to the Landlord
and informed her that the rental unit was in a bad
condition due to left over furniture of the old tenants, garbage everywhere,
rodents and rat poo in the kitchen drawers and on the floor. The Landlord
responded that she will go over the repairs list with the Tenant when she is back in Canada. The Tenant sent the

December 7, 2020.

The Tenant testified
that upon her return the rental unit was very dusty, the furnace filter was dirty and the repairs she requested on Nov 30, 2020 were not completed. The Tenant testified

remove a dead mouse, spray the rental for bugs and she do repairs at her own,
including plastering the holes in the rental
unit,. The Tenant stated that by end of January 2021 she finished
painting the rental unit by herself.

a result of a breach of a tenancy
agreement, the person entitled to claim the amount has a duty to take reasonable
steps to minimize the person's losses.
 
Analysis




 
23.   
For the following reasons,
I find, on a balance
of probabilities, that the
Landlord was in breach of section 20 of the Act because the unit was not in
a good state of repair on December 1, 2020, the date the Tenant was entitled to
occupy the rental unit .
 
24.   
There is no dispute that the previous tenant’s belongings that occupied much of the rental
unit until they were removed on December 7, 2020. It is also uncontested that
as of December 1, 2020 the unit was very dirty and required extensive repairs.
On November 30, 2020, the Tenant sent the
Landlord a repairs
list and that the Landlord
was fully aware of the repairs required in the
rental unit.
 
25.   
I do not accept
the Landlord’s excuse
of not doing the cleaning
and repairs on time.
The Landlord had an obligation to complete the repairs and cleaning by December
1, 2020.
 
26.   
There is no dispute
the Tenant incurred
$150.00 in out-of-pocket expenses to purchase cleaning and painting material.
The Landlord has reimbursed $150.00 to the Tenant.
 
27.   
The tenancy
effectively began on December 1, 2020. However,
the Tenant could not use the rental unit between December 1 and 7, 2020, because the
previous tenant’s belongings were occupying much of the rental unit. Therefore,
the Tenant is entitled to a 100% abatement of rent in the amount of $161.00 for
these seven days (monthly rent of
$700.00 and per diem compensation of $23.00 - $700.00 x 12 ÷ 365 x 7).
 
28.   
The Tenant’s use and
enjoyment of the rental unit during the period from December 8, 2020 to February 28, 2021 was significantly diminished because of the numerous items requiring repair in the living room, kitchen, bathroom
and hallway. More specifically, the burner missing on the stove, kitchen
floor tiles and bathroom faucet showerhead in the bathtub. The Tenant is
entitled to 40% abatement of rent in the amount of $763.60 for these 83 days
($700.00 x 12 ÷ 365 x 83).
 
29.   
I also accept that the Tenant spent a number of hours
cleaning and repairing
the unit in January and February because of the
Landlord’s failure to meet her obligations under section 20. I find that
$250.00 is a reasonable amount of compensation for this issue.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.    
The Landlord
shall pay to the Tenant
a rent abatement of $924.60.
 
2.    
The Landlord
shall pay to the
Tenant $250.00 for the time that the Tenant has spent in cleaning up the rental unit.
 
3.    
The Landlord
shall also pay the Tenant
$53.00 for the cost of filing the Tenant’s
application.
 
4.    
The Landlord
shall pay the Tenant the full amount
owing by January
24, 2022.




 
5.    
If the Landlord does
not pay the Tenant the full amount owing by January 24, 2022 the Landlord will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 25, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the outstanding
balance.
 
6.    
The Tenant
has the right,
at any time, to collect the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
