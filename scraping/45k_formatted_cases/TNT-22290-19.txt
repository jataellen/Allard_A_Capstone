Order under Section
135
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNT-22290-19
 
 
 
 
 
RK (the 'Tenant') applied for an order determining that NEN (the 'Landlord') has collected or retained
money illegally.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 21, 2021.
Only the Tenant attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant file a T1
Application on November 18, 2019, seeking the return of her last month’s rent
deposit in the amount of $500.00 and the return of her key deposit in the
amount of $200.00.
 
2.    
The rental unit is a
room in a house. The monthly rent is $500.00.
 
3.    
The Tenant moved into
the rental unit on June 1, 2019, and she moved out of the rental unit on July 31,
2019. At the request of the Landlord, the Tenant paid the Landlord a last
month’s rent deposit in the amount of $500.00 and a key deposit in the amount
of
$200.00. In addition, the Tenant paid to the Landlord rent for the
months of June and July.
 
4.    
The tenancy was
terminated on July 31, 2019, upon the Tenant vacating the rental unit due to an
insect infestation that became unhabitable for the Tenant. The Tenant testified that her room
became infested with bugs/roaches that were in plain sight
every single day and that created various health
issues for the Tenant resulting in her having to take time off work. The Tenant indicated she obtained rashes
as well as an eye infection, and that the roaches infested her bed and other
possessions. The Tenant tendered
pictures in support of her testimony that the roaches/bugs were prevalent
throughout her rental unit, and also produced a receipt for the rent deposit
and key deposit she paid the Landlord.




File Number: TNT-22290-19
 
5.    
Section 105 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”) provides that the only security
deposit that a landlord may collect is a rent deposit.
 
6.    
Neither the rent
deposit nor the key deposit has been returned to the Tenant. I find the key
deposit in the amount of $200 was collected contrary to section 105 of the Act.
Further, since the tenancy was terminated on July 31, 2019 and the Landlord was
paid July rent in addition to the last month’s rent deposit, I find that the
Landlord has illegally retained the last month’s rent deposit in the amount of
$500.00..
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord
shall pay to the Tenant
the sum of $700.00. This amount represents
$500.00 for the last month's rent deposit and $200.00 for the security
deposit.
 
2.    
The Landlord
shall also pay to the Tenant $50.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
3.    
The total amount the Landlord owes to the Tenant is $750.00.
 
4.    
If the Landlord does
not pay the Tenant the full amount owing by January 21, 2022, the Landlord will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January
22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the outstanding
balance.
 
5.    
The Tenant
has the right,
at any time, to collect
the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
