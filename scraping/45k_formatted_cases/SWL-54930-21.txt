Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-54930-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


46, 870 JALNA
BOULEVARD LONDON ON N6E3C7


 




Between:


M.F. Arnsby Property Management Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Rebecca
Needham


Tenant



 
 
 
M.F. Arnsby Property Management Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict Rebecca Needham (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 20, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, John Edlund
attended the hearing. As of 11:20 a.m., the Tenant
was not present or represented at the hearing although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from June 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective July 23,
2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant
is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $129.00.
 
4.     The Tenant paid $387.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord’s attempts
at negotiating a repayment agreement were unsuccessful.
 
6.    
The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $129.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent
deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021 to July 23,
2021.
 
8.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including
the impact of COVID-19 on the




 
parties and whether the
Landlord attempted to negotiate a
repayment agreement with the Tenant and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until January 31,
2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. Additional time given to the
Tenant to either secure alternative accommodation or pay the outstanding
amount.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the
Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before January 31, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$422.79*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January 7,
2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also
pay to the Landlord $4.24 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting January 8, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 31, 2022, the
Tenant will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from February 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022, then starting February
1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
February 1, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 31, 2022,
the Tenant pays the amount
of $702.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this
order for eviction will be void. This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after
February 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
