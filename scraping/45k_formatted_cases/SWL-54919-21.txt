Nancy Polinsky (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Shannon Benoit (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 20, 2021. Only the Landlord
attended the hearing. As of 11:03 a.m., the Tenant
was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.

the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from August
1, 2021 to October 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective August 30, 2021.

The Tenant
vacated the rental
unit on October
15, 2021. The Tenant was in possession
of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.

The lawful
monthly rent was
$1,400.00.
 
4.     
The Tenant
has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.     
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,400.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     
Interest on the rent
deposit is owing to the Tenant for
the period from March 22, 2020 to
August 30, 2021.

2.    
The Tenant shall pay to

3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 17, 2022, the
