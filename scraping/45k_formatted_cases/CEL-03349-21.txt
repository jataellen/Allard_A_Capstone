Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Sherise Evelyn Simpson Stephen Matthew Parsons


Tenants



 
 
Nundita Devi Seechurn and Tejwant Seechurn (the 'Landlords') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and
evict Stephen Matthew Parsons and Sherise Evelyn Simpson (the 'Tenants')
because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video
conference on February 7, 2022.
 
Only the Landlords attended the
hearing. As of 3:00 p.m. the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to October
31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective September 27, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on
October 31, 2021. The Tenants
were in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.
3.    
The lawful monthly rent was $1,750.00.
4.    
The Landlords are not holding a last month's rent
deposit.
5.    
The Tenants were credited
one month’s rent because the Landlords served
a Notice of Termination for Landlords' own use.
6.    
The Tenants paid $1,750.00
after the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of October
31, 2021, the date the Tenants gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlords.




File Number: CEL-03349-21
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $1,750.00*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to October 31, 2021.
 
3.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlords
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before February
25, 2021, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 26, 2021
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
