Order under
Subsection 74(11)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-16951-20-VO
 
 



In the matter
of:


UPPER UNIT,
39 AUSTIN TERRACE TORONTO ON M5R1Y2


 




Between:


Li Li


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Haiying Lin


Tenant



 
 
On October
25, 2021 the Board issued order TSL-16951-20 terminating the tenancy
and evicting Haiying Lin (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant failed to pay rent that the Tenant owes.
 
On December
15, 2021 the Tenant filed a motion to void order TSL-16951-20 because after the eviction order became enforceable, the Tenant paid Li
Li (the 'Landlord') the amount required
to void the order under subsection 74(11) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').
 
The motion
was heard by videoconference on February 3,
2022.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant attended
the hearing. The Landlord was represented by Michelle
Chen. The Tenant was represented by Rong Wei Yu.
 
Also in attendance was the Landlord’s daughter, Candace Tang, who assisted
her in translating between the Mandarin and English languages.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant filed an
affidavit swearing that the Tenant paid the full amount required to
void order TSL-16951-20 to the Landlord after the eviction
order became enforceable.
2.     The Tenant has not previously made a motion
under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside an eviction order during the
period of the Tenant’s tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
3.    
The order issued on October 25,
2021 required the Tenant to pay $35,156.00 on or before November 5, 2021 to
void the order. As of December 15, 2021, the date the Tenant filed her motion,
the rent for December 2021 came due bringing the amount due and owing to $38,156.00, since the
rent is $3,000.00 per month.
 
4.     The Tenant’s affidavit states payments were made to the Landlord
via cheque after the order’s enforceable date in the
following amounts: $38,156.00 on December 14, 2021 and $340.00 on December 14,
2021.

5.    
At the hearing, the Landlord confirmed the receipt of these payments
which included the
$318.00 fee charged by the Court Enforcement Office.
 
6.     The Tenant appears
to be in a credit
balance of $22.00.
 
7.     Based on the evidence before the Board, I find that
the Tenant has voided the order dated October 25, 2021
at the time she filed her motion to void and thus, the motion to
void the order must be granted.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The motion to void order
TSL-16951-20 is granted.
 
2.     Order TSL-16951-20 is void and cannot be enforced by the Landlord.
