Between:


Forough Azampanah


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Azadeh Gholami


Tenant



 
 
 
Forough Azampanah (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Azadeh Gholami
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 24, 2022. Only
the Landlord's Legal Representative, Bahman Roudgarnia, attended the hearing.
As of 1:55 p.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The application is amended
to reflect that the Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
 
2.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
September 15, 2021 to February 14,
2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective October 2, 2021.
 
3.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
November 14, 2021. The Tenant
was in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
4.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,100.00.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
November 14, 2021. The Tenant
was in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.




File Number: TNL-35160-21
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,200.00*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to November 14, 2021.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
11, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 12, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
