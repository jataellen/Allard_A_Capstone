1015, 3400 RIVERSPRAY CRESCENT MISSISSAUGA ON L4Y3M5


 




Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Patrick Palmer


Tenant



 
 
Westwood Management International
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Patrick
Palmer (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the Board on September 20, 2021 with respect to
application CEL-00223-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order: the Tenant
did not pay $640.00 on or before
November 25, 2021, nor did they pay the lawful rent for December on or before
December 1, 2021.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $4,027.00 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order CEL-00223-21. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $3,362.00 and that amount
is included in this order. As a result, the previous order CEL-00223-21 is
cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from November 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.
 
6.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,935.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.




File Number: CEL-04384-21
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from October 1, 2020 to
January 18, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The previous order CEL-00223-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 29, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
pay to the Landlord $3,159.07*. This amount represents the rent owing up to December 31, 2021 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $63.62 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
January 29, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
January 30, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 29, 2022, then starting
January 30, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 30, 2022.

The tenant has until January 28, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 28, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on July 30, 2022 if
the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
