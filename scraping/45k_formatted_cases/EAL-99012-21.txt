Marie Nyirambirukiye


Tenant



 
On November 16, 2021, Starlight Canadian
Residential Growth F (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict Marie
Nyirambirukiye (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant
owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order
issued by the Board on October 5, 2021 with respect to application EAL- 96259-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant
if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.       
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
3.       
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$2,517.59 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order EAL-96259-21. The amount that is still owing from that
order is $2,417.59 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order EAL-96259-21 is cancelled.
 
4.       
Since the date of the order,
the Tenant has also failed to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from
November 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
Order EAL-96259-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 18, 2022.

3.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $3,583.49*. This amount represents the rent owing up to November 30, 2021 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application.
 
4.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$38.33 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting December 1, 2021 to
the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
18, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January
19, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 19, 2022.

The tenant has until January 17, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 17, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on July 19, 2022 if the order has not been
filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that
has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
