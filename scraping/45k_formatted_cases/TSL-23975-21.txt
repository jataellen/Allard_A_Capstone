File Number: TSL-23975-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1808, 1501 WOODBINE AVENUE EAST YORK ON M4C4H1


 




Between:


Metcap Living Management Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Maureen
Ramnath


Tenant



 
 
Metcap Living Management Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict Maureen Ramnath (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021. The Landlord's Legal Representative, Sara
Mathew and the Tenant attended the
hearing.
 
Preliminary Issue:
 
The Tenant intended
to raise issues
pursuant to section
82 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (‘the Act’).
However, neither the Board nor the Landlord was informed prior to the hearing.
As the Landlord was not prepared to respond to the allegations and categorically denies any record of an
infestation in the unit, the issue was not considered. This does not prevent
the Tenant from filing their own application at a future date.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from August 1,
2021 to December 31, 2021. Because of
the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 25,
2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,306.47.
 
4.     
The Tenant
paid $3,000.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.     
The Tenant moved into
the two-bedroom unit in 2017 and conducts her childcare coaching business from
there. Due to an alleged infestation, the business was closed about two weeks
prior to the hearing and the Tenant currently works out of the unit making anywhere
from $980.00 to $1,200.00 a month. The Tenant intends to start a




File Number: TSL-23975-21
 
new higher job in
January 2022 and requested an opportunity to continue the tenancy by paying $309.86 each month
in addition to ongoing rent. I do not find the Tenant’s plan feasible as her
current income is less than the proposed payments.
 
6.     
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,306.47 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021
to August 25, 2021.
 
8.     
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the
Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant and find
that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 4, 2022
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. Additional time given to the Tenant
to either secure
alternative accommodation or pay the outstanding amount.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before February 4, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $2,736.54*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 11, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay
to the Landlord $42.95 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 12, 2022 to the date the
Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 4, 2022, the
Tenant will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from February 5, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 4, 2022, then starting February
5, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
February 5, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$5,024.82 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$6,331.29 if the payment
is made on or before
February 4, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the




File Number: TSL-23975-21
 
appropriate deadline,
then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after
February 5, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
