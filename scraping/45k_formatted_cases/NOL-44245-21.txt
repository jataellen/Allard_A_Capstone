Matthew Parr


Tenant



 
 
 
Skyline Living (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Matthew Parr (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that
the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed administration
charges related to NSF cheques.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 20, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Sandi Brooks, attended the
hearing. As of 3:30 p.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice
of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from July 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because of the
arrears, the Landlord served a Notice
of Termination effective September 2, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord
incurred charges of $100.00 for administration charges
related to cheques tendered by or on behalf of the
Tenant, which were returned NSF.
 
3.    
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on
December 31, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the
date the application was filed.
 
4.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,239.80.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,239.80 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 6, 2021 to September 2, 2021.




File Number: NOL-44245-21
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     The
tenancy is terminated as of December
31, 2021, the date the Tenant returned
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $3,721.30*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to December 31, 2021 and the total charges related to NSF cheques tendered
to the Landlord by or on behalf
of the Tenant, less the rent deposit
and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing* on
or before March 7, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 8, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
