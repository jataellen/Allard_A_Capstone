Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-41575-20
 
 



In the
  matter of:


318, 201 RAVENWOOD AVENUE THUNDER BAY ON P7B5N5


 




Between:


Tbdssab


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Carolyn Lyons


Tenant



 
 
 
Tbdssab (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Carolyn Lyons (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused undue
damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring
the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage; and because the Tenant,
another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the
residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord
or another tenant.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard on February
7, 2022. Only the Landlord’s representative Betty
McConkey-Kennelly attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant leaves items including shopping carts and a
television in the hallway. The Tenant has been told this is in violation
of the fire code but continues to leave items in the hallway. The Tenant left a bedbug infested mattress in the hallway which
the Landlord was required to dispose of on April 1, 2020.
 
2.     The Tenant changed
to lock on the door to the rental unit and would not provide
a replacement key to the Landlord for seven months.
 
3.     The Tenant has guests yelling
up to her unit to be let in and disturbing the other
residents.
 
4.     The Tenant ran the shower head outside
of the bathtub which cause a flood affecting the unit below. The cost to repair this was $3,011.00.




 
5.    
There have been complaints of a high volume of individuals going in and out of the
Tenant’s unit who are known to be involved with drugs and drug activity.
 
6.     I find the Tenant has wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the rental unit and the residential complex
by causing water damage and leaving a bedbug infested
mattress in the hallway.
 
7.     The Landlord has incurred costs of $3,083.00 to repair the damage.
 
8.     I also find the Tenant
or a person permitted in the residential complex by the Tenant has substantially interfered with the
Landlord's and the other tenants' reasonable enjoyment of the residential
complex.
 
9.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of February
25, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 25, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $3,083.00, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,032.02, which represents compensation for the use of the
unit from December 16, 2020 to February 14, 2022.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$4.77 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from February 15, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
February 25, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
7.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 25, 2022, then starting February
26, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 26, 2022.
