10543969 Canada
Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Mckenny Perrin (the 'Tenant')
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on December 21, 2021 at 1:34 PM. The Landlord’s agent, Roxanne
Lacroix, and the Tenant attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s L2 application is based on two N5
notices.
 
2.    
An N5 was served on the
Tenant on May 13, 2021, with a termination date of June 5, 2021 (the “first
N5”). It alleges that the Tenant, on the night of May 11, 2021, the tenant,
another occupant, or a guest
caused substantial noise at night
which interfered with other
tenants’ reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex.
 
3.    
The second,
non-voidable N5 (the “second N5”) was served on July 22, 2021 pursuant to section
68 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(Act). The second
N5 has a termination date
of August 7, 2021 and alleges that the Tenant, another occupant or a guest
played loud video games or action movies causing a buzzing sound to emanate
from the rental unit, these activities happening as late as 3:22 AM on June 25, 2021 and 1:20 AM on July 21, 2021, thereby substantially
interfering with another tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of the residential
complex.
 
4.    
It is the allegations
contained in the second N5 that I must consider in determining whether to
terminate the tenancy. For the reasons that follow below, I dismiss the
Landlord’s application as there is insufficient evidence
to prove that any interference with another tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of the residential
complex was substantial.




 
5.    
The Landlord
called no other tenant as witnesses, and evidence was introduced by its
administrative agent, Roxanne Lacroix, who does not work on-site at the
residential complex.
 
6.    
The crux of the Landlord’s case is that the Landlord
received complaints from other
tenants about
noise coming from the Tenant’s rental unit. These
events are denied by the Tenant. While
the Landlord alluded to other complaints beyond those in the N5, it is the events in the N5 that must be proven to sustain an eviction application. Other events are
material only if these events are proven, and I must consider whether to delay
or deny the eviction.
 
7.    
For the events of June 25, 2021 that form one of two events enumerated in the second N5, the extent of the Landlord’s
evidence was a redacted e-mail, purportedly from another tenant, which read as
follows:
 
C'est loin
d'être intéressant de se faire réveiller à 3:22 du matin par le bourdonnement du 409. Et ce n'est past la première fois que ca arrive durant la
nuit. Je prie pour qu'il y ait in
changement.
 
(Translation: It's far from interesting to be woken up at 3:22 am by the buzzing of
409. And it's not the first time this has happened during the night. I pray that there will be change.)
 
8.    
For the events of July
21, 2021 that form the other of two events enumerated in the second N5, the extent of the Landlord’s evidence
was a redacted e-mail, which read as follows:
 
Heure: 1:20 du matain
et je viens d'être revéillée par le bourdonnement du voisin #409. Assez déplaisant.
 
(Translation: Time: 1:20 am and I was just woken
up by the buzzing of neighbor #
409. Quite annoying.)
 
9.    
In both instances, the
e-mails submitted by the Landlord were redacted to obscure the identity of the
sender(s). There is therefore no
opportunity for the Tenant to know the identity of the other tenant(s), or have the ability to cross examine
them. The evidence
is ultimately hearsay.
 
10.  From an adjudicative standpoint, the
credibility or motives of the other tenant(s) cannot be assessed, and it is
also impossible for me to assess whether the Tenant’s actions in fact caused
a substantial interference with the other tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex. The complaint e-mails give little to
contextualize the events, other than to indicate that the neighbouring tenant
was awakened by noise. The volume,
duration, or extent of the noise is nowhere stated in the e-mails, nor are the
consequences to the Tenant. I can
give only minimal weight to the evidence.




 
11.  Simply put, the Landlord’s evidence
does not prove on a balance of probabilities that any
interference with another tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of the residential
complex was substantial.
 
12.  Ms. Lacroix indicated that the other
tenants were perhaps unwilling to testify as they feared reprisals, although
the Tenant expressed some surprise at this allegation. A tenant facing eviction is entitled to procedural fairness, and
the Landlord must prove its allegations on a balance of probabilities to
sustain an eviction. The lack of
corroborating testimony of other tenants purportedly impacted by the Tenant’s actions,
or other persons with personal knowledge of the
events, is in my view fatal to the Landlord’s application, particularly when
the complaint e-mails introduced as evidence are so brief and devoid
of particulars.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord's application is dismissed.
