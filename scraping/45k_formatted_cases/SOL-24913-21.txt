Order under Section 87(1)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24913-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1, 241 GIBSON
AVENUE HAMILTON ON L8L6K2


 




Between:


Todd Anderson


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Nikola Makulova


Tenant



 
 
 
Todd Anderson (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Nikola Makulova (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 11, 2022. The Landlord’s Legal Representative,
Kimberly Holleran, attended the hearing. The Tenant had signed into the
videoconference but was not present at the time the hearing was called. Miroslav
Balaz, who identified himself as the Tenant’s common law partner was present,
however, he had no documentation authorizing
him to act on the Tenant’s
behalf and as a result
was not allowed to
participate in the hearing.
 
Preliminary matter:
 
The Landlord sold the building after filing the application but prior
to the hearing taking place.
The new Landlord took possession of the rental complex on January 1, 2022. As a
result, the application will only address outstanding arrears to December
31, 2021 and not termination of the
tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
17, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,300.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.




File Number: SOL-24913-21
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent
deposit of $1,300.00. As part of the sale this deposit has been transferred to the new Landlord and will not be applied
against any amounts
owing here.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,200.00, which represents the amount of rent
owing up to December 31, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before January
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
