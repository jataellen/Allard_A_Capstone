In the matter
of:


2, 8 BOYCE AVENUE SCARBOROUGH ON M1J1K5


 




Between:


Niroja Arulananthan


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jewette
Josephine Hudson


Tenant



 
 
 
Niroja
Arulananthan (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Jewette Josephine Hudson (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owe.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on January 5, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Pran Ganesh, attended
the hearing. As of 2:08 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
April 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 17, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant
was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,500.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant
paid $1,300.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,500.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
April 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.
 
7.    
The only part of the application that proceeded was the claim for rent arrears. As a result, the order will be limited to rent
arrears and costs only, not eviction.
