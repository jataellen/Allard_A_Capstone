Tenants



 
 
 
Jason Dykstra (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Shawn Sivyer and Alanah Bugyra (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 17, 2022.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s legal representative, T. Schoenleber, and the Tenant,
A. Bugyra, attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2013 to May
31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination.
 
2.    
The Tenants moved out of the rental unit on May 9, 2021, and the tenancy terminated on that date.
 
3.     There is no last month’s
rent deposit.
 
4.     After moving out, the Tenants
commenced paying $300.00
each month towards
the outstanding arrears, and the amount of arrears owed to February 28,
2022, are
$9,966.31. The Tenants also owe the Landlord the $186.00 cost of filing this application, for a total of $10,152.31
owed.
 
5.     The parties agree that the Tenants shall
continue paying $300.00
each month towards the outstanding arrears (34
months).

6.    
The Landlord said that he would
not take further
steps to enforce
this order as long as the
Tenants continue paying $300.00 towards the arrears until they reach a zero
balance.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants terminated on May 9, 2021. The Tenants moved out of the rental unit
on or before May 9, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$9,966.31*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to May 9, 2021.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before August 31, 2024, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from September 1,
2024 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
