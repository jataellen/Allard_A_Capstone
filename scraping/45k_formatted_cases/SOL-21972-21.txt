RWC Management (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sarah Coplan (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 25, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Ibifiri
Fabian, attended the hearing. As of 10:07
a.m., the Tenant
was not present or represented at the hearing although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period
from March 1, 2021 to May 31, 2021. Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination effective April 12, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on January
18, 2022. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,100.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,100.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from August 1, 2020 to
April 12, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $3,000.00 after the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of January
18, 2022, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.




File Number: SOL-21972-21
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $6,194.16*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
18, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 11, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 12, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
