In the matter
of:


2484 REGATTA AVENUE OTTAWA ON K2J5V6


 




Between:


Pengshuai Ren


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Kim Roots Martin
Roots


Tenants



 
 
 
Pengshuai Ren (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kim Roots
and Martin Roots (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on December 20,
2021.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord's Legal Representative, Kathleen
Jin, and Kim Roots,
on behalf of the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Preliminary Issue
 
1.     The N4 notice of termination indicates: the amount of
rent charged from September 1, 2019 to July 31, 2020 as $19,000.00; the month rent as $2,000.00. When asked why the
monthly does not divide evenly
into the rent charged for that period,
the Landlord's Legal Representative explained that the
Tenants had paid $4,500.00 during the period which was subtracted from the
amount charged; $22,000.00 minus $4,500.00 equals
$17,500.00, which
is indicated on the notice.
Therefore, the amount
required to void the
notice was correct. The Tenant did not dispute the amount. Therefore, I found the N4 to be valid and the matter proceeded to
hearing.
 
Merits
 
2.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2019 to December
31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 21, 2020.
 
3.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,500.00
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.




 
4.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from November
1, 2019 to September 21, 2020.
 
5.     The Tenants paid $2,000.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.     The total amount
owing to December
31, 2021, including
the application filing fee, is
$47,500.00.
 
7.     The Landlord's Legal Representative submitted that the
Landlord has suffered severe prejudice du to the excessive amount owed by the
Tenants; it has been a struggle to keep the mortgage paid. The Landlord has not
seen any good faith effort for the arrears to be paid, nor does he believe the
Tenants can afford a repayment plan due to the amount owing. The amount
owing already exceeds
the Board’s monetary
jurisdiction, and any
repayment would be extremely prejudicial to the Landlord. Further, in Jayaraj
v. Metcap Living Management Inc., 2021 ONSC 1489 (CanLII) at para 12, the
Court considered it an abuse of process by the Tenant to request relief after
living rent free in excess of one-year.
 
8.    
The Tenants did
not dispute the amount owing, she requested relief from eviction in the form of
a repayment plan beginning February 2022, with rent on the 1st and arrears on the 15th: $1,500.00 paid to
arrears the first 6 months of the payment plan; and $2,000.00 paid to arrears the remainder of the repayment
plan. They need this long of a repayment
plan because she is on ODSP and he is just returning to work after a broken
back in 2019, plus their children moved out which left them without any help
towards anything.
 
9.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until
March 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. Although the arrears
are excessive, this allows time for the Tenants get things in order to vacate with out any further prejudice
to the Landlord as the rent deposit
would go towards the month of March. I find this
reasonable; although the Tenant did not elaborate on her disability, I accept
her testimony that her husband has only recently recovered to the extent that
he is physically able to work.
 
10.  Any monies paid by the Tenants from the hearing
sate to the issuance of this order shall
be deducted from the amounts indicated as owing below.
 
11.  This order contains
all the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 31, 2022.




 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $35,000.00*, which represents the amount of rent owing up to the Board’s monetary
jurisdiction and compensation up to February 18, 2022,
less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $65.75
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 19,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
5.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before March 31, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from April 1, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 31, 2022, then starting April 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 1, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenants
wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
 
i)               
$49,686.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022,
or
ii)             
$51,686.00 if the payment
is made on or before
March 31, 2022**.
 
If the Tenants
do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
The amount required to void
the order exceeds the monetary jurisdiction of the Board. This is an
amount that the Tenant can choose to pay if they choose not to vacate the rental unit. The Board is not ordering this amount to be paid. This amount
is optional and only required if the Tenants
elect to remain in the rental unit.
Therefore, the Board is not ordering this amount to be paid and is not
ordering an amount that exceeds the limit.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after
April 1, 2022 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
