Order under Section
77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-54985-21
 



In the matter
of:


96 MALAKOFF STREET ST. THOMAS ON N5P1M4


 




Between:


Wayne Ostrander


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jamie Hagerty


Tenant



 
 
Wayne Ostrander (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jamie Hagerty (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant entered
into an agreement to terminate the
tenancy.
 
The application was sent to a hearing
because the Tenant’s
signature was not dated.
This application was heard by video conference on December 8, 2021.
Only the Landlord’s legal representative, T. Mobberly, attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant
did not attend
the hearing scheduled for 9 a.m. I waited
until 9:25 a.m.,
and then I proceeded to hear the matter on an uncontested basis.
 
2.    
The Landlord applied to
the Board for an ex parte eviction order because the Landlord and the Tenant signed
an agreement to terminate the tenancy as of August
31, 2021 and the Tenant did not move out of the
rental unit by the termination date set out in the agreement.
 
3.    
The Landlord’s legal
representative said that the Tenant moved out on September 26, 2021, and the tenancy
terminated on that date. Consequently, this application is moot.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant terminated on September 26, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
 
 
January 6, 2022 Date Issued
Member, Landlord and Tenant Board
