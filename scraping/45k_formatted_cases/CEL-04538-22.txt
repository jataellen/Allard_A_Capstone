Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-04538-22
 
 



In the
  matter of:


LOWER LEVEL BASEMENT, 70 KINGSMERE CRESCENT
BRAMPTON ON L6X1Z4


 




Between:


Rafael Martinho
  Victor Martinho


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Donna Seedath
  Milan Krnjaic


Tenants



 
 
 
Rafael Martinho and Victor
Martinho (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Milan Krnjaic and Donna Seedath
(the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because
the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the
Board on December 13, 2021 with respect to application CEL-02258-21.
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlords could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants
have not met the following
conditions specified in the order:
The Tenants did not pay $1,100.00 arrears on or before December 25,
2021.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the
Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlords are entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $2,401.00 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order CEL-02258-21. The amount that is still owing from that
order is $1,301.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order CEL-02258-21 is cancelled.

It is ordered that:
 
 
1.     Order CEL-02258-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 28, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlords $3,015.79*. This amount represents the rent owing up to
February 17, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the previous
application.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $36.16
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 18,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before
February 28, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March
1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after March 1, 2022.

The tenant has until February 27, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by February 27, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.
