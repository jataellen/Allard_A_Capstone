Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24444-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


163 MILLIGAN ST FERGUS ON N1M3S4


 




Between:


Patrick Robinson Katherine Teekasingh Ryan Farnsworth


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Elizabeth Stefanic


Tenant



 
 
 
Patrick Robinson, Katherine Teekasingh and Ryan Farnsworth (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Elizabeth Stefanic (the 'Tenant') The Landlords
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after
the termination date.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on January 5, 2022.
The Landlord’s legal representative, T. Kelly, and the Tenant attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
At the hearing, the
Landlords requested the consent of the Board to withdraw their application.
 
2.     The Tenant requested costs for having to
appear at the hearing. The Landlord’s legal representative submitted
that he advised the Tenant before
the hearing that he was
going to withdraw, and she need not attend.
 
3.    
Pursuant to
Interpretation Guideline 3, in most cases, costs can be awarded in cases of
unreasonable conduct. Conduct
is unreasonable if it causes undue expense
or delay. I do
not find that the Landlords’ conduct was unreasonable. The Tenant’s request is
denied.
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.    The Landlords' application is withdrawn.
