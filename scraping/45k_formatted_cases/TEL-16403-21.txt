Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-16403-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


MAIN FLOOR,
255 BELLAMY ROAD
NORTH TORONTO ON M1J2M1


 




Between:


Natale A. Catalano


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Beverly Harvey
  Gordon Jilks


Tenants



 
 
 
Natale A. Catalano (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Beverly Harvey and Gordon Jilks (the
'Tenants') because the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for the
purpose of residential occupation.
Also, because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenants remained in the unit after
the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 9, 2021.
The Landlord and the Tenants attended the hearing.
At the hearing, the Landlord requested
the consent of the Board to withdraw
their L1 application dealing with non-payment of
rent. The Tenants were not opposed to the Landlord’s request.
 
 
Determinations:
 
L1
application
 
1.     In accordance with subsection 200(4) of the Act, I consent to the withdrawal of the L1 portion of the application.
 
L2 application
 
2.     On January 4, 2021 the Landlords served the Tenant
with an N12 notice pursuant to section 48 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).
The Termination Date in the notice is March 31, 2021. The N12 sets out that the Landlords
requires possession of the
rental unit for their child.

3.    
Section 48.1 of the Act requires
that a Landlord compensate a Tenant an amount equal to one month’s rent.
 
4.    
Section 55.1 of the Act requires
that the compensation be paid by no later than the termination date set out in the notice. In this case, that would be on or before
March 31, 2021.
 
5.     At the hearing,
the Landlord testified
that they did not pay the Tenants
compensation for the N12
notice because the Tenant was in substantial arrears of rent. Neither party would agree on a month to
apply compensation.
 
6.     I accept that a landlord may provide compensation by
waiving one month’s of rent or foregoing a
portion of arrears in the same amount. However, in order for it be
considered “compensating” the tenant within the meaning of s. 48.1, the
landlord must expressly notify the tenant that they are waiving or forgiving
one month’s rent for the purpose of providing
compensation. In my view, it cannot be said that a landlord
has compensated a tenant if they do not provide such
notification.
 
7.     The burden of proof regarding whether compensation
has been paid to the Tenants rests on the Landlord on this
type of application. In the circumstances, I cannot find that compensation has been paid in accordance with section 55.1 of the Act. In fact, as of the date of the hearing, the Landlord had
still not credited the Tenant with one month’s rent.
 
8.     I find that the Landlord
has not compensated the Tenants pursuant
to section 55.1 of the Act.
 
9.     For this reason,
I must dismiss the Landlord’s application.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's L1 application is withdrawn.
 
2.     The Landlord’s L2 application is dismissed.
 
 
January 19, 2022 Date Issued
 
Toronto East-RO
2275 Midland Avenue, Unit 2
Toronto ON M1P3E7
