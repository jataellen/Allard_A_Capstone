Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55832-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


102, 3015 SANDWICH STREET WINDSOR ON N9C1A5


 




Between:


Tri Sands
Apartments Ltd.


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Ashley Abbey


Tenant



 
Tri Sands Apartments Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Ashley Abbey (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 27, 2022. As
of 11:02 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this
hearing by the Board. The Landlord’s
Agent, Tim Currie attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period
from September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 24, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful monthly rent is $1,300.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant made no payments after the application was filed.
 
5.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 21, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$6,966.61*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 10, 2022.




File Number: SWL-55832-21
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$42.74 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 11, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 21, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 21, 2022, then starting February
22, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 22, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February
21, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $7,986.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit. If this payment is not made
in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act
to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection
on or after February 22, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period
of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
