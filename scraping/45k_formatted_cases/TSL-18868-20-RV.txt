Review Order
 
2-8 St. Thomas St. Holdings Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Neil Williamson (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved
by order TSL-18868-20 issued on August
25, 2021.
 
On October 12, 2021,
the Court Enforcement Office, (the Sheriff)
enforced the order issued on August 25, 2021.
 
On October 13, 2021 the Tenant
requested a review
of the order, and that the order
be stayed until the request
to review the order is resolved.
 
On October 14, 2021 interim order
TSL-18868-20 -IN was issued, staying
the order issued
on August 25, 2021.
 
On October 19, 2021, Justice
Corbitt of the Divisional Court, confirmed a stay on the portion of Interim Order
issued October 14, 2021, which directed the Landlord to restore the Tenancy. The remainder direction lifted the Stay of
Proceedings for the purpose of the Board to conduct an expedited Review
Hearing.
 
The Tenant alleges that he did not have the capacity
to self-represent nor to properly
consult duty Counsel at the
hearing on the merits.
 
The review was heard via videoconference on December 13, 2021.
 
The Landlords Legal
Representative Martin Zarnett, and Agents Janice Brown and Eadefemi Adejumo, and the Tenant attended the hearing. The tenant was assisted by he daughter
Jennifer Williamson.




 
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     At the outset, the Tenant requested an adjournment as
he had recently been released from hospital and would like time to retain and
instruct counsel. He indicates that
he and his family have been focusing on his health care and not in preparing
for this hearing. It was only once the Notice of hearing was issued that they
learned that Legal Aid would not represent them at
this hearing. They indicated that they had not made other efforts
to retain counsel.
 
2.     The Landlord objected
to this on basis that the Tenant
was represented by a lawyer when
the review was filed and that it would be prejudicial to the Landlord if
adjourned.
 
3.     The Tenant confirmed his desire to regain possession
of the rental unit. On this basis, I
denied the request to adjourn
so that the issue of Tenancy could be resolved.
I indicated that the health
issue might be grounds to adjourn, however as he is assisted by his daughter,
that was not necessary. The daughter
had been able to read all the documents, and could read anything to her father
if necessary for the purposes of this hearing.
 
4.     The Tenant described the circumstances that led to the
consent agreement order being issued. He had been in touch with ACTO (Legal
Aid clinic) the week prior to the hearing,
and after that was prepared to negotiate a consent agreement with the Landlord,
which he did. Subsequently, the Tenant
was injured, required
hospitalization and in fact was in
hospital and participated in the hearing from there.
 
5.    
The Tenant testified that he was happy with the settlement, and that he just wanted to get it over with as he believed he could
pay the rent and live up to his commitments.
 
6.    
The hearing recording from June 9, 2021 was played. In it the Tenant is heard actively participating in the hearing
process, asking questions and seeking confirmation of the side-deal the parties
had entered into when the consent agreement was negotiated.
 
7.     The Tenant can be heard confirming the terms of the
consent agreement, his understanding that if not paid he could be evicted.
He confirmed that he knew he was doing a consent deal.
 
8.     The Tenant confirmed that he did not have a capacity
assessment completed, that he is not represented by a Public Guardian, nor
anyone else to represent him to manage his affairs or property. Further
the Tenant confirmed
that he did not speak
with Duty Counsel on the hearing day, when afforded
that opportunity as he had “nothing” to discuss with them.
 
9.     Finally, the Tenant confirmed that he understood that
he had reached a consent arrangement with the Landlord prior to the day of the hearing
and that he had participated in the hearing to have it
presented to the Board.




 
10.  
Disability is defined as “mentally incapable within the meaning
of section
6 or 45 of
the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992 ( the ‘SDA’) in respect
of an issue in the proceeding,
whether the person has a guardian or not; Rules of Civil Procedure r 1.03(1).
 
11.  Section 2 and 3 of the SDA reads as follows:
 
2 (1) A person
who is eighteen years of age or more is presumed to be capable
of entering into a contract. 1992,
c. 30, s. 2 (1).
 
(2) 
A
person who is sixteen years of age or more is presumed
to be capable of giving
or refusing consent in connection with his or her own personal care. 1992, c. 30, s. 2 (2).
 
(3) 
A
person is entitled
to rely upon the presumption of capacity with respect to another
person unless he or she has reasonable grounds to believe that the other person
is incapable of entering
into the contract
or of giving or refusing
consent, as the case may be.
1992, c. 30, s. 2 (3).
 
12.  The issue before this hearing
is was the Tenant mentally
incapable in relation
to the issues before the Board
on June 9, 2021.
 
13.  Did the Tenant have
an inability to know or understand the minimum
choices or decisions required and to make them? The hearing recording and the Tenant’s
admissions indicate that the
Tenant understood the hearing, actively participated and was able to ask
questions to confirm the side deal.
 
14.  Did the Tenant appreciate the consequences and effects of his choices or decisions?
The Tenant confirmed and the hearing recording indicated that he understood that the
Landlord could file for eviction without notice under s.78 of the Act.
 
15.  Did the Tenant understand the nature of the
proceedings? The proceedings on June 9, 2021 related to residential tenancy, in
which as a tenant he understood that he had not been paying rent, for which he
could face eviction. These are not
complicated proceedings; the legislation is remedial in nature with a tenant
protection focus. The Tenant admitted
and the recording confirmed the Tenant
understood that the purpose of the hearing was to submit the terms of the consent agreement for the
Board to issue an order to avoid being evicted.
 
16.  Did the Tenant
have an inability to retain and instruct counsel.
The Tenant admitted
that the spoke with ACTO (Legal Aid) in the week prior to the June 9,
2021 hearing and that he entered into an agreement
notwithstanding their advice.
The Tenant admitted
that he did not speak with
Duty Counsel on the day of the hearing when offered the opportunity, as he
stated because he had nothing to discuss with them.
 
17.  I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the
Tenant was capable of giving the consent that he gave at the hearing
on June 9, 2020. The Tenant was capable of actively
participating in the hearing, confirming the side-deal and that he was aware of
the consequences. In addition, at no time did the Tenant indicate he was in
hospital, and heavily medicated, or have someone come on the call to assist
him, all indications that




 
might have triggered the Presiding Member to ask confirming questions
regarding any potential
incapacity. As a result, I am satisfied that the Tenant was reasonably able to participate in the June 9, 2021 hearing.
 
18.  On the basis of the submissions made in the request, I am not satisfied that there is a
serious error in the order or that a serious error occurred in the proceedings.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The request to review
order TSL-18868-20 issued
on August 25, 2021 is denied. The order is confirmed and remains
unchanged.
 
2.    
The interim order issued on October
14, 2021 is cancelled. The stay of order TSL-18868- 20 is lifted. The order to
reinstate the Tenant back into the unit is also cancelled.
