In the matter
of:


136 ST ANDREWS ROAD SCARBOROUGH ON M1P4C8


 




Between:


Akshay Sapra


Tenant




 


 
and


 




 


Erhan Sarigul


Landlord



 
 
 
Akshay Sapra (the 'Tenant') applied for an order determining that Erhan Sarigul
(the 'Landlord') has
collected or retained money illegally.
 
This application was heard via video conference on December 14, 2021.
The Tenant and the Landlord attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.     This application is about
an allegation that a rent deposit was given to a Landlord and then not returned as the
Tenant did not take possession of the rental unit.
 
2.     The Tenant met with the Landlord on November 7, 2019
regarding a furnished room the Landlord had available for rent in the amount of
$630.00 per month. This room was
available for rent immediately. After viewing the rental unit, the parties
verbally agreed upon the amount of the monthly rent. The Landlord collected a rent deposit from the Tenant in the amount of $200.00
on November 7th, 2019 but did not provide
a receipt or a lease agreement.
 
3.     The Tenant testified that he believed
that he had rented the unit from the Landlord
but for confirming the date
that he would be moving into the rental unit and beginning occupancy. No keys to the rental unit were exchanged
as the Tenant did not have the required funds on November 7, 2019. The Tenant stated that the Landlord was
going to provide the keys to the rental unit to the Tenant once the Tenant
provided the remainder of first month’s rent.
 
4.     The Tenant stated that he made it clear to the
Landlord on November 7, 2019 that he could not immediately move into the rental unit but that it
would be some time during the
following week, perhaps November 11 or 12 and that he would be in contact with
the Landlord to confirm the date.




 
 
 
5.    
On November
8, 2019, the Tenant texted the Landlord
and said that he would move into the rental unit on November 15, 2019
rather then the originally stated dates of either November 11 or 12th . The Landlord agreed
to the move in date but told the Tenant that rent had started on November
8, 2019 and that was when the tenancy began.
 
6.     On November 11, 2019, the Tenant stated that the Landlord repeated that the rental unit was
available immediately via a text message and asked the Tenant to come by, pay the remainder of the rent and retrieve the
keys.         The Tenant replied on November 11, 2019 offering to start rent on November 12, 2019
otherwise he would like his deposit
returned. The Landlord did not reply until November 13th, 2019.
 
7.    
On November 13, 2019,
the Landlord stated
that rent for the unit started on November 8th and that if
the Tenant was not going to
comply, he would advertise the unit for rent
again. The Tenant testified that he told the Landlord to advertise the
rental unit and asked the Landlord for his deposit back.
 
8.     The Tenant alleges
that he did not enter into a tenancy agreement with the Landlord as a
date for the beginning of the tenancy had not been agreed upon and no keys had
been provided by the Landlord.
 
9.     The Landlord has refused to return the deposit the Tenant paid.
 
10.  The Landlord testified that he vaguely discussed a
move-in date with the Tenant and thought that it would have been on a Monday
or Tuesday. The Landlord also does not dispute that the Tenant provided a
deposit in the amount of $200.00 on November 7, 2019.
 
11.  The Landlord stated
that the reason
why the Tenant
could not pick up the keys to the
rental unit was only because the Tenant was out of town.
 
12.  The Landlord testified that because of the Tenant
not moving into the rental
unit, he advertised the unit
for rent but was unable to rent it for three months and he should therefore be able to keep the
deposit. The Landlord also confirmed
that he did not respond to the Tenant’s communication of November 13, 2019 and
had no further conversations with the Tenant.
 
13.  
Section 107 of the Residential Tenancies Act , 2006, (the ‘Act’) provides:
 
“A Landlord
shall repay the amount received
as a rent deposit
in respect of a rental unit if vacant possession of the
rental unit is not given to the prospective tenant.”
 
14.  The decision of the Ontario
Court of Appeal
in Musilla v. Avcan
Management Inc., 2011 ONCA 502 provides the Board with guidance, starting at
paragraph 10:
 
When one
looks at the words of section 107(1), It is notable that the landlord is to
return the deposit if vacant possession is not given to the prospective tenant.
The words “not given” suggest that it is the refusal
or inability of the landlord
to provide




 
the premises that triggers the
obligation to return the deposit to the prospective tenant. In the present
case, however, it is the tenant’s action
in refusing to take the unit that prevented him from taking
possession, not any act of the landlord
 
However, with respect to a
landlord’s ability to retain a rent deposit, section 105(1) and 106(1) of the
Act provides that a landlord may only take a deposit as security against the payment of the last month’s rent. The landlord
may not take a deposit
to secure any other obligation. Thus, if a tenant breaches a tenancy
agreement and the landlord, in accordance with its obligations to mitigate its
damages, is able to re rent the premises without suffering any loss of rent,
the landlord is not entitled to retain the rent deposit. The landlord cannot
realise double payment by use of a deposit, nor can it apply the funds to any
other purpose.
 
15.  The Divisional Court, in Opara v. Cook, [2008],
O.J. No. 1934 (Ont.Div.Ct.), also deals with
the issue currently
before the Board. In simple
terms, the court held that a tenancy agreement is a contract and once
the parties have entered into a tenancy agreement, unless the Landlord agrees,
the Tenant cannot decide to break the agreement.
 
16.  Accordingly, the only real questions before the Board is whether the parties had entered a tenancy
agreement at the time that the Tenant informed the Landlord that he no longer
wished to rent the unit and requested the return of his deposit
and whether the Tenant is entitled to the return of the deposit
pursuant to section 107 of the Act
 
17.  In my view it is not clear, in this case, that there
was a “meeting of the minds” and a tenancy agreement was actually arrived
at between the Tenant and the Landlord
as there was no confirmed date
of when the tenancy would commence. The Tenant appears to have assumed that
there was no date mutually agreed upon while the Landlord assumes that the
tenancy began on the day the Tenant viewed the rental unit and paid a deposit.
It is clear based on the evidence
and submissions at the hearing that the parties had agreed to a monthly rent
but the essential elements had not been reached, particularly with the date the
tenancy was to have commenced, which I believe was not been solidified. A binding contract requires that there be a consensus
between the parties
on the essential terms.
Therefore, I am satisfied that the tenancy
agreement had not been
completed.
 
18.  
It seems that where a landlord has
collected a rent deposit before entering a tenancy agreement as permitted by
subsection 106(1) of the Act, and no tenancy agreement is entered into,
the phrase “vacant possession of the rental unit is not given” in subsection
107(1) of the Act may encompass
the situation where either party chooses
not to proceed with entering the tenancy agreement, thereby entitling
the prospective tenant to a refund of a paid rent deposit. By contrast, once a
tenancy agreement is made, whether
pursuant to the terms of a rental application (as in Musilla, supra) or in some other unspecified form (as in Opara v.
Cook, supra), neither
party may unilaterally repudiate the agreement, and a tenant who does so
is not entitled, under subsection 107(1)
of the Act, to the return of the rent deposit. Following the foregoing logic, since no tenancy agreement was made in this case, the Tenant would be
entitled, under subsection 107(1) of
the Act, to a refund of the rent deposit.




 
19.   The Landlord retained
the Tenant's last month's rent deposit contrary
to subsection 107(1) of the
Act. This is prohibited by the Act.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord shall pay to the Tenant
the sum of $200.00. This amount represents
$200.00 collected for a rent deposit.
 
2.     If the Landlord does not pay the Tenant the full
amount owing by January 30, 2022, the Landlord
will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January
31, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the outstanding
balance.
 
3.     The Tenant has the right,
at any time, to collect
the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
