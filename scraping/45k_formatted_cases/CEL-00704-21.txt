In the matter
of:


314, 174 HURONTARIO STREET COLLINGWOOD ON L9Y2M2


 




Between:


Chris Millsap


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Mike Miller


Tenant



 
 
 
Chris Millsap
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Mike Miller
(the 'Tenant') because the Landlord intends to demolish the rental unit. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on September 23, 2021. The Landlord attended and was represented by Ciara
MacMillan. The Tenant attended and
spoke with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The application is
based on a Notice to End the Tenancy (form ‘N13’) because the Landlord requires the rental
unit to be vacated in order to demolish it. The N13 was
issued pursuant to s. 50 (1)(a) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’).
 
2.    
I am satisfied that the Landlord
has obtained the necessary permits
for this work.
 
3.    
The Landlord
has delivered to the Tenant,
a compensation cheque
in the amount of
$2,228.28, equivalent to three months’
rent, as required
by s. 52 (1) of the Act.
 
4.    
There is no dispute
about the makeup
of the rental complex, it contains 31 residential
units and two commercial units. The
Tenant occupies unit 314.
 
5.    
There is also no dispute that the Landlord
purchased the building
in April, 2021 and has
undertaken to complete significant and extensive renovations to the interior of
the building. The renovations include
gutting the 31 residential units and replacing all flooring, plumbing,
electrical, fixtures, cabinetry and HVAC systems as set out in the Landlord’s
N13.




 
6.    
The Tenant has raised
the issue of whether or not the work constitutes a demolition (as specified in the Notice of
Termination) or a renovation.
 
7.    
The Landlord’s oral testimony is that the building cannot
be demolished in its entirety because it is a protected
heritage building, and it abuts/forms part of a neighbouring building.
 
8.    
The Landlord provided a
copy of the floor plan for the Tenant’s unit.
Under cross examination by the Tenant, the Landlord admitted that the
unit’s exterior walls would remain in place, the front door will remain in the same place, and the size and location
of amenities will not change.
 
9.    
Both the Landlord and Tenant submitted a copy of the Building
Permit. It is classified on the permit as a “Renovation.”
 
10. 
The difference between
a renovation and demolition is not defined in the Act. However, the key issue in the Landlord’s application to the
Board is whether the work constitutes a renovation or a demolition for the
purposes of s. 50(1) of the Act.
 
11. 
Under s. 50(3) of the
Act, the Tenant may exercise a right of first refusal on a renovated unit
and return to the unit at the same rent. It
is the Tenant’s evidence that he wants to stay in his unit because there is a
lack of affordable housing in the area, and he would lose his rent subsidy
should he move.
 
12. 
In the situation where
the rental unit continues to exist, albeit greatly improved, it is possible for
the Tenant to exercise a right of first refusal, because the rental unit is
still there. The Tenant may move back
and continue the tenancy. Where the
rental unit is gone, it is not possible for the Tenant to move back because it
no longer exists. The fact that the
Act distinguishes between renovations and demolitions by the Tenant’s right of
first refusal shows the intention of theses sections of the Act is to preserve
the tenancies where it is possible to do so.
 
13. 
 Accordingly,
a project will be defined as a renovation under the Act in a case where it is
possible for the Tenant to move back into the unit, and a project will defined
as a demotion where it is not possible for the Tenant to move back into the
unit.
 
14. 
This project is a
renovation of the existing unit, not a demolition, and the Landlord’s
application must be dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.    
The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall return/pay to the Landlord
$2,228.28, the compensation the Landlord paid to
the Tenant.




 
 
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before
January 16, 2022, the Tenant will
start to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
