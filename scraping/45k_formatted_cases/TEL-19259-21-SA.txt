Order under Section
78(11)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19259-21-SA
 
 



In the matter
of:


A, 42 BRIDGE
STREET EAST BANCROFT ON
  K0L1C0


 




Between:


Thrmiga Sathiyamoorthy


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Michelle
Greening Robert Carter


Tenants



 
 
 
Thrmiga
Sathiyamoorthy (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Sharon Fraiser, Michelle
Greening, Dave Philmore
and Robert Carter (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
failed to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the Board on August 10, 2021 with respect to application
TEL-14440-21.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved
by order TEL-19259-21, issued on September 15, 2021. The Tenants
filed a motion to set aside order TEL-19259-21.
 
This motion was heard by video conference on December 8, 2021.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s legal representative, D. Saunders, and the Tenants
M. Greening and R. Carter,
attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.    
The correct Tenants are
M. Greening and R. Carter. They had
been removed from the order TEL-14440-21, issued
on August 10, 2021. In fact, it is S. Fraiser and D. Philmore that should have been removed
from that order. This order has been amended to name
the correct Tenants.
 
2.    
The Tenants
said that they moved out of the rental unit on November
26, 2021, and the
tenancy terminated on that date. Consequently,
the Tenants’ set aside motion is moot.
