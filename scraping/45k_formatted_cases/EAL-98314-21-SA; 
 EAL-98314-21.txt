In the matter
of:


5 BARTHOLOMEW STREET BROCKVILLE ON K6V2R2


 




Between:


Frankware Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Nicholas Beaudin


Tenant



 
 
 
Frankware Inc.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Nicholas Beaudin (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have
the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because
the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the mediated settlement
issued by the Board on October 12, 2021 with respect to application
EAL-97059-21.
 
The Landlord's
application was resolved by order EAL-98314-21, issued on November 24, 2021.
The Tenant filed a motion to set aside order EAL-98314-21.
 
This motion
was heard by video conference on January 28, 2022. The Landlord’s Agent,
F. Akujobi, and the Tenant
attended the hearing. The Tenant spoke with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
Order EAL-97059-21 provided that the Landlord
could apply to the Board under section
78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and
evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain conditions specified in the
order.
 
2.     The Landlord filed the application under section 78 of the Act, alleging
that the Tenant
failed to pay $1,000.00, portion of the rent, on October 1, 2021; $300.00,
balance of the rent, on October 15, 2021; and $350.00 arrears
on October 15, 2021 contrary to the order. This resulted in ex parte eviction
order EAL-98314-21 terminating the tenancy.
 
3.    
In support of the motion to set aside the order, the Tenant testified that someone broke into
his car and stole his wallet, hence he was unable to make the payments.
 
4.    
The Tenant has made a total
payment of $3,900.00 since the issuance
of order EAL-97059- 21 and while the arrears in
that order was $2,486.00, it is $3,786.00 for the period ending January 31,
2022.




File Number: EAL-98314-21-SA
 
5.     The Tenant requested a termination date of February
28, 2022, stating that there is a
last month's rent deposit that can be applied to the month of February 2022.
 
6.     The Landlord opposed the Tenant’s motion and testified
that there is no last month's rent deposit. Since the Tenant asserted
that he paid a last month's rent deposit, he was ordered to send a copy of the tenancy agreement as well as evidence of payment of the deposit
to the Board by January 31,
2022. As of the date of this order, the Tenant has failed to send any evidence
to substantiate his claim.
 
7.     Based on all the evidence, there is no dispute that
the Tenant breached the order to pay the rent
arrears in addition to ongoing rent. The Tenant
proposed no plan for the payment
of the outstanding arrears which has since increased to $3,786.00 for the
period ending January 31, 2022.
 
8.    
I
have considered all the disclosed
circumstances in accordance
with subsection 78(11)
(b) of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair
to grant the Tenant’s motion. Late
and missed payments are an ongoing pattern which the Tenant is unable to
address.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The motion to set aside Order EAL-98314-21, issued on
November 24, 2021, is denied. The order is unchanged
 
2.    
The stay of order EAL-98314-21 is lifted on February 15, 2022.
