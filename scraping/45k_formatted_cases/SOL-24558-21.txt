Guelph Non-Profit Housing Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for
an order to terminate the tenancy and evict David Khayipangi, Vanessa Khayipangi and Ngalula Mubalamata (the 'Tenants')

This application was heard by video conference on December 14, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord’s Agent, Sylvia Maloney
and the Landlord's Legal Representative,

paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from April

of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August
25, 2021.
