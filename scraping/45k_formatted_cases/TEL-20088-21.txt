Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: TEL-20088-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


303, 1850
VALLEY FARM ROAD PICKERING ON L1V3W4


 




Between:


Capreit Limited Partnership


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


John Crews


Tenant



 
 
Capreit Limited Partnership (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict John Crews (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque
charges and related administration charges.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on February 2, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative,
Jason Paine, attended the hearing. As
of 10:37 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice
of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
July 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective September
30, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,476.16
as of January 1, 2022.
 
4.    
The Landlord incurred charges
of $20.00 for cheques tendered
by or on behalf of the
Tenant, which were returned NSF and $80.00 for related administration charges.
 
5.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,458.67 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord. Interest on the rent
deposit has been paid to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2020 to
December 31, 2020.
 
6.    
The Tenant paid $5,983.67
after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the




File Number: TEL-20088-21
 
Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 6, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,084.72*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
23, 2022 and the total charges related
to NSF cheques tendered to the
Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $48.53
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 24, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before March 6, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 7, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 6, 2022, then starting
March 7, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 7, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)    
$3,089.33 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022,
or
ii)     $4,565.49 if the payment is made on or
before March 6, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after March
7, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
