Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-99830-17
 



 


 


 



 
GEL
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict TC(N)
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because she has been persistently late in paying the rent.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on January 18, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, SK, and the Tenant attended the
hearing.
 
 Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent she was required to pay for the period from
November 1, 2017 to January 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination.
.
2.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,536.91 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
3.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from November 1,
2017. 
 
4.      At
the hearing the parties agreed that a standard order with a voiding date of
February 9, 2018 would issue with respect to the arrears of rent.
 
5.      The
Tenant has been persistently late in paying the rent. She explained that she
has had financial challenges over the past 2 years because her husband was
deported in October 2015 and she has spent considerable amounts of money
seeking his return to Canada. Her husband returned to Canada in May 2017, and
was able to secure a job in August 2017. He still works at the same job. The
Tenant gave assurance that she is willing and able to repay the arrears and
February rent by February 9, 2018 and to pay the rent in full and on time
beginning March 2018.
 
6.      The
Landlord’s representative objected to granting the Tenant a prompt payment plan
in the event she pays all the arrears and February rent by February 9, 2018.
The Landlord has obtained Board orders relating to arrears of rent on the
following dates in relation to this tenancy: July 14, 2014, August 14, 2015,
March 30, 2017, June 9, 2017, August 25, 2017, November 6, 2017. In each case the
Tenant either paid the arrears before the hearing date or paid the arrears
within the voiding period set out in the order. The amount at issue in the
applications was typically one month of rent arrears, although in one instance
2 months were in arrears. The Landlord has not brought a previous application
for termination of the tenancy for persistent lateness.
 
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction on the
persistent late payment portion of the application subject to the condition(s)
set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
The factors I took into consideration were the length of the tenancy (over
6years), the relatively small amount of arrears in each of the prior
applications brought by the Landlord and the fact that the Tenant voided the
orders within the allocated time. Despite significant financial expense and
hardship brought about by her husband’s deportation, the Tenant has continued
to pay rent, albeit late. I am satisfied that the Tenant is willing and able to
pay rent in full and on time in future.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before February 9, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,536.16*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to January 31, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $50.53 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 1, 2018 to the date she moves out of the
unit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
February 9, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from February 10, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 9, 2018, then starting February 10,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 10,
2018.
 
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, she must pay to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
 
i)        $3,270.73
if the payment is made on or before January 31, 2018, or
ii)       $4,807.64 if the payment is made after January 31, 2018 but on or
before February 9, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 10, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
10.   If
the Tenant voids the eviction portion of this order as permitted by paragraphs
8 or 9, then the following provisions will apply:
 
a)    From
March 2018 to and including February 2019 the Tenant shall pay the monthly rent
to the Landlord on or before the first business day of the month for which it
becomes due.
b)    If
the Tenant fails to make any one of the payments in accordance with paragraph
10a) of this order, the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to
the Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the
tenancy and evicting the Tenant.
