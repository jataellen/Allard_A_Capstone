  matter of:


105D, 30 SAINT LAWRENCE STREET TORONTO ON M5A3N1


 




Between:

Tenant



 
 
 
Phil Nazar (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Carmen Damiano (the
'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes
because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the Board on
August 11, 2021 with respect to application TSL-19225-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following condition
specified in the order: On or
about November 12, 2021 and November 16, 2021 the Tenant interfered with the
reasonable enjoyable of the unit for other Tenants by playing loud music.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 18, 2022.
 
2.     The Landlord is authorized to offset the following
amounts from the amount the Landlord owes the Tenant:
$12.82 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
January 8, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit;
 
3.     The Landlord or the Tenant
shall pay to the other
any sum of money that is owed as a
result of this order.

4.     If the unit is not vacated on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January
19, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
5.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 19, 2022.
