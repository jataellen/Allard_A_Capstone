Alma Agot


 



 
 
Executive
Properties Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict David Agot and Alma Agot (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on September 14,
2021 with respect to application SOL-22162- 21.
 
The Landlord's
application was resolved by order SOL-25611-21, issued on November 26, 2021.
The Tenants filed a motion to set aside order SOL-25611-21.
 
This motion
was heard by video conference on January 31, 2022. The Landlord's Legal
Representative, C. Aylwin and the Tenant, Alma Agot attended the hearing.
 
Having moved
out of the rental
unit in 2021, David Agot is
removed as a party to the application.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     Order SOL-22162-21 provided
that the Landlord
could apply to the Board
under section 78 of
the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain conditions specified in the order.
 
2.     The Landlord filed the application under section 78 of the Act, alleging
that the Tenant
failed to pay the utility bills on or
before October 15, 2021, contrary to the order. This resulted in ex parte eviction order SOL-25611-21 terminating
the tenancy.
 
3.     In support of the motion
to set aside the order,
the Tenant testified
that she has paid all the
outstanding utility bills except for the January 2022 bill which the Landlord
concedes was only recently sent to the Tenant.
 
4.     However, the Landlord
was accurate that the Tenant
failed to pay the utility
bill on October 15, 2021. The payment was made on October 21, 2021 in breach of order SOL-22162-21.

5.    
Although the Tenant breached the
order, section 78(11)(b) of the Act provides that the Board shall set aside the
eviction order if the Board is satisfied, having regard to all the
circumstances, that it would not be unfair to do so.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The motion to set aside Order SOL-25611-21, issued on
November 26, 2021, is granted. The order cannot be enforced by the Landlord.
 
2.     The order issued by the Board on September 14, 2021
with respect to application SOL- 22162-21, is cancelled and replaced with this
order.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay the utility
bill for the month of January 2022 on
January 31, 2022 as stated at the hearing.
 
4.    
For a one-year
period starting February 2022 and continuing to January 2023, on receipt of the utility bill from the Landlord, the Tenant shall pay the utility bills on or before the 15th day of each month.
 
5.    
If the Tenant
fails to meet any of the conditions set out in paragraph 3, the Landlord may
apply under section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and
evicting the Tenant. The Landlord
must make the application within 30 days of a breach of a condition.
