Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-21096-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


3105 DUNDAS STREET BURLINGTON ON L7M0W3


 




Between:


Hardip Singatwal Manjinder Singh Atwall


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Kimberley Hall Rob
Henderson


Tenants



 
 
 
Hardip Singatwal and Manjinder
Singh Atwall (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kimberley Hall and Rob Henderson (the 'Tenants') and for an order
to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the
Board on August 26, 2021 with respect to application HOL-10842-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlords could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants
have not met the following
condition specified in the order: The
Tenants failed to pay $700.00 towards the arrear, on or before November 15,
2021.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order
required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlords are entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $7,000.00 for rent arrears
in Order HOL-10842-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $5,342.50 and
that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order
HOL-10842-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,400.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from June 1, 2014 to
January 7, 2022.

It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order HOL-10842-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 18, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $5,493.61*.
This amount represents the rent owing up to January 7, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlords $46.03
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 8, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before
January 18, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
January 19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January
19, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after January 19, 2022.

The tenant has until January 17, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 17, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
