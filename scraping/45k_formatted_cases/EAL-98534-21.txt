Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number:
EAL-98534-21
 



In the matter
of:


610, 981 GULF PLACE OTTAWA ON K1K3X9


 




Between:


981 Gulf Place Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jeffery Moodie
  Jordan Powell


Tenants



 
 
981 Gulf Place Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jeffery Moodie and Jordan Powell (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 15, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Sabrina Sciulli, attended the hearing. As
of 2:28 p.m., the Tenants were not 
 
present or represented at
the hearing although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the
period from October 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective October 19, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     As of February
1, 2022, the monthly rent for the unit increased to $1,616.70.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,585.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from June 1, 2021 to
October 19, 2021.
 
7.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.

It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 7, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $5,445.77*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
24, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$53.15 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 25, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before March
7, 2022, the Tenants will
start to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from March 8,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 7, 2022, then starting
March 8, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so

Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 8, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenants
wish to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$7,392.70 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022,
or
ii)             
$9,009.40 if the payment
is made on or
before March 7, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not
make full payment in
accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may
make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay
the amount required under that subsection on or after March 8, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once
during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
