Taras K. Demerson


Tenant



 
2-8 St. Thomas Street
LP c/o BentallGreenAak (Canada) LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict Taras K. Demerson (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent.
The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
This application was heard via
video/teleconference on October
12, 2021.
The Landlord’s Agent Adefemi
Adejumo, the Landlord's Legal Representative
Martin Zarnett, the Tenant and the Tenant's Legal
Representative Samuel Mason attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The issue in the application filed is the Tenant has a
history of failing to pay the rent either in full and/or on the date it was due, and therefore on June 30, 2021, the Landlord
sent the Tenant an N8 Notice to end the tenancy asserting the Tenant has been
persistently late with all the rent payments payable to the Landlord.
 
2.    
The Tenant's Legal Representative
raised a preliminary issue that a rent arrears application TSL-18869-20 had
been heard on June 9, 2021 and was resolved by a consent order dated August
25, 2021, and on September
17, 2021 the Tenant requested a review of that order and that
the order be stayed until the request to review the order was resolved. In
turn, the Tenant's Legal Representative requested that until that review was
resolved that this application be adjourned.
 
3.    
The Landlord's Legal
Representative acknowledged that there was a previous order issued by the Board but cited the Landlord’s right to file this L2 application for a separate cause of action and behaviour.
4.    
Based on the testimony and
submissions made by both the representatives for the Landlord and the Tenant,
I denied the adjournment request
and I was satisfied that this
application does not meet the elements of res judicata to preclude the hearing
of the merits of the Landlord’s application.




 
5.    
The N8 notice given was
issued pursuant to paragraph 58(1)(a)
of the Act which says:
58 (1) A landlord
may give a tenant notice
of termination of their tenancy
on any of the following grounds:
1.
The tenant has persistently failed
to pay rent on the date it becomes due and payable.
 
6.     It was undisputed that the month
lawful rent is $1,502.67.
 
7.     A copy of the original
tenancy agreement entered
into March 1, 2014 was submitted that states
Paragraph 3 –
 
The Tenant covenants to pay to the Landlord
during the Term without deduction... Base Rent and
Additional Rent on the first day of each and every month… Tenant shall provide
in advance 12 post-dated cheques….
 
8.    
The Tenant
disputes that rent is due on the 1st day of the month. He purports that the due date was ‘verbally’ amended to the 7th day of each month and that at a hearing
held on June 9, 2021 it was clearly affirmed.
 
9.     Prior to making a final determination
in this application, I reviewed the
hearing recording and the review order issued December
29, 2021. In both references it was clear that the Tenant was well aware that the
Landlord required him to pay the rent by the first day of the month as
he is obliged to do under his
lease agreement. No definitive
evidence was submitted in support
that the rent due date was officially changed from the first to the seventh.
 
10.  In fact, the Member that dealt with the Tenant’s
Request to Review was very direct in her
determinations – “the Tenant is masterful at self-justification, and he acts as
though he can impose his own tenancy rules”.
 
11.  I am
satisfied that the Tenant was required to pay the rent by the first day of the month as
he is obliged to do under the original lease agreement.
 
12.  The Landlord’s Representative submitted a rent payment
ledger documenting that the Tenant had not paid the monthly rent in any amount on any date dating back to
January 2020.
 
13.  The Tenant did not dispute
that rent was not paid in full and on time. The Tenant testified that payments were not
paid for a variety of reasons. It is noted that the Tenant had not filed a
Tenant application in support of those variety of reasons.
 
14.  The rent payment ledger submitted by the Landlord
clearly documented that the Tenant had not paid the monthly rent in any amount dating
back to January 2020. The Tenant’s extended period of non-payment
of monthly rent is incontestable evidence that the Tenant has been persistently
late with all the monthly rent payments payable to the Landlord.




 
 
15.  The board issued
a Review Order TSL-18869-20, on August 25, 2021. The Board
cancelled and replaced that order with a new conditional order.
16.  After having considered all of the disclosed circumstances I am satisfied that the Tenant has persistently failed to pay the
rent on the date it was due, and I find it would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction subject to the add-on condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
17.  The order contains
all the reasons for the decision within
the order. No other reasons
will be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Commencing immediately and for
the duration of the tenancy between the Tenant and the Landlord, the Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord the lawful monthly rent for the rental unit, currently in the amount of $1,502.67 in full and on time, on or before
the 1st day of each month.
 
2.    
If the Tenant fails to make any
one of the payments in paragraph 1 above, in full and on time, the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Act, without
notice to the Tenant
for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord must
make this application no later than 30 days after the Tenant fails to make a
payment.
