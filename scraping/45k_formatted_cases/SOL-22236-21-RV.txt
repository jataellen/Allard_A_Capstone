Review Order
 
2019813 Ontario Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Ahmed Mandil (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved
by order SOL-22236-21 issued on September
14, 2021.
 
On October 13, 2021, the
Landlord requested a review of the order because they allege, they were not reasonably able to
participate in the scheduled hearing of August 31, 2021.
 
The request was heard by way of
video conference on January 7, 2022. The Landlord, Chris Skeba (owner), the
Landlord’s Legal Representative, Dale Skvereckas, the Tenant, and the Tenant’s Agent,
Ghada Mandil. Ghada Mandil
is the Tenant’s sister
and the Tenant authorized her to represent him during the hearing. The Tenant declined
to speak to Tenant Duty Counsel
prior to the commencement of the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
Review Request
 
1.       
The Landlord’s Representative submitted that she and the Landlord
had every intention of participating in the hearing
scheduled on August 31, 2021. The
Landlord’s Representative submitted that when she diarized the date in her
files, she did so incorrectly.
 
2.       
The Landlord’s Representative that on August
25, 2021, she served the Tenant with the
L1/L9 update sheet with a repayment proposal.
She also sent this to the Board. The
Landlord’s Representative submitted that this supports her claim that she and
the Landlord had every intention of participating in the hearing.




 
3.       
The Tenant’s Agent submitted that
the she and the Tenant received the Landlord’s Representative’s email of August
25, 2021. The email indicated the
hearing was scheduled for August 31, 2021. The
Tenant’s Agent submits that the Landlord’s Representative knew the hearing
date. The Tenant’s
Agent entered in evidence a copy of the email date August 25, 2021.
 
4.       
The Landlord’s Representative submitted that the email of August 25, 2021 supports her position that she had every intention
of participating in the hearing. The Landlord’s Representative submitted that
she and the Landlord should not be penalized for human error.
 
Findings
 
5.       
The case law from the Divisional
Court generally instructs that the meaning
of the phrase “not reasonably able to participate” should be interpreted broadly to ensure
natural justice and, where
a party shows that they genuinely
intended to participate in a hearing but was
prevented from so doing, then they should be entitled to a hearing through the
review process. However, this genuine intent to participate must be borne out
by the evidence, such as actions and conduct by the party, which clearly
demonstrate the party’s intent to participate in the hearing.
 
6.       
In Kathryn King-Winton v.
Doverhold Investments 2008 CanLII 60708 (ON SCDC), the Divisional Court
stated: “Being reasonably able to participate in the proceeding must be
interpreted broadly, natural justice requires no less.” In King-Winton there
was evidence to suggest that the tenant missed her hearing because of her honest but mistaken belief in an incorrect hearing date. In that case, the tenant
mistakenly attended at the Board
on the wrong date to hear the Landlord’s application.
 
7.       
Here, the Landlord’s
Representative states that she made a human error which resulted in the Landlord not being able to reasonably participate in the hearing. In keeping with the
guidance of the Division Courts, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities
that the Landlord genuinely wanted to participate in the hearing of August 31,
2021. I am also satisfied that the Landlord did not attend the scheduled
hearing because of an honest diarizing mistake on the part of the Landlord’s
Representative.
 
8.       
The Landlord’s request to review the order is granted.
 
New Hearing of Landlord’s L1 Application
 
Preliminary Issues
 
1.       
The Tenant filed section 82 issues
to be raised at the hearing. In review of the Tenant’s section 82 issues, I
note the Tenant did not request any remedies, except for wanting a copy of the
tenancy agreement. All other issued raised had no remedies requested for which the Board could order. I advised the Tenant that the only section 82 issue he could
raise during the hearing was the issue of not having received a proper tenancy




 
agreement. I also informed
the Tenant that if he would like his other section 82 issues addressed by the Board, he
could file his own tenant application.
 
L1 Application
 
2.       
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period from
February 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective March 4,
2021.
 
3.       
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
4.       
The monthly rent is $1,200.00.
 
5.       
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,200.00 from the Tenant and
this deposit is still being held by
the Landlord.
 
6.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenant for the period from August 1, 2020 to March 4, 2021.
 
7.       
The Tenant paid $2,400.00 after the application was filed.
 
8.       
The parties agreed that the amount the Tenant owes to the Landlord
is $12,186.00, which is
inclusive of arrears of rent ($12,000.00) and the cost ($186.00) for filing
the application.
 
9.       
The Tenant testified that he did
not pay the rent owed to the Landlord because of his section 82 issues, namely
the fact that he has not received a proper tenancy
agreement.
 
Relief from Eviction
 
10.   
The Tenant testified that he would
like to stay in the rental unit. He offered to repay the arrears of rent to
the Landlord by way of a payment plan. The
Tenant testified that he could afford to pay the Landlord $1,200.00 every three
to four months. Based on this
proposed payment plan,
it would take the Tenant more than 2 years to repay the arrears of rent.
 
11.    The Tenant testified
that if the tenancy was terminated, he would need 2 months
to move out of the rental
unit.
 
12.    The Landlord’s Representative submitted that the
Tenant’s repayment plan is not reasonable as it would too long for the Landlord
to recoup the monies owed. The
Landlord’s Representative further
submitted that the Tenant has not paid rent in two
years and that the Landlord would like to terminate the tenancy.
 
13.   
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act. In making this finding, I considered the
significant arrears of rent owed to the Landlord and that postponing eviction
may further prejudice the Landlord as arrears of rent would most likely
continue




 
to accumulate. I further
find the Tenants
proposed repayment plan to be unreasonable
as it would take the Landlord 2 years to recoup the monies owed.
 
Section 82 Issues
 
14.   
The Tenant testified that the Landlord
provided him with a copy of the lease agreement on February 17, 2021, being 5
months after the date the tenancy started.
 
15.   
The Tenant testified that the copy of the lease agreement
he was provided contains the incorrect start and end date.
 
16.    The Landlord’s Representative agreed that the lease agreement contains the incorrect dates and agreed to amend the
agreement.
 
17.    The parties agreed that the start date on the lease agreement should be September
1, 2020 and the end date should be August 31, 2021.
 
18.    The Landlord’s Representative agreed to provide
the Tenant with the amended
lease agreement n later than January 13, 2022.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.       
Order SOL-22236-21 issued on September 14, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the
following:
 
Section 82 Issue
 
2.       
On or before January 13, 2022, the Landlord shall provide
the Tenant with an amended copy of the lease agreement reflecting the start date as September
1, 2020 and the end date as August 31, 2021.
 
L1 Application
 
3.       
Unless the Tenant voids the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 29, 2022.
 
4.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $10,381.10*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January
18, 2022, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit.
 
5.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$39.45 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 19, 2022 to
the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
6.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.




 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 29, 2022, then starting January
30, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 30, 2022.
 
9.       
If, on or before January 29, 2022,
the Tenant pays the amount of $12,186.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that
the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on
time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
10.   
The Tenant may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after January 30, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make
this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
