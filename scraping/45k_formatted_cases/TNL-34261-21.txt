Dora Alicia Guzman
De Molina Dora Molina


Tenants



 
 
 
Artisan
Charitable Foundation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Dora Alicia
Guzman De Molina
and Dora Molina
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe and have been persistently late in paying
their rent.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021.
 
Only Daniel
Abraham, the agent for the Landlord’s representative, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants
have persistently failed
to pay the rent on the date it was due.
Since August of 2020 the Tenants have
never paid rent on time and in full. Because of the Tenants’ persistent late payment, the Landlord served a
notice of termination effective September 30, 2021.
 
2.    
In addition,
the Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from April 1, 2021 to
December 31, 2021.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is
$1,406.00.
 
4.    
The Tenants
paid $5,000.00 after
the application was filed.
As a result, the arrears
of rent owing for the period
ending December 31, 2020 total $4,120.65.
 
5.    
The Landlord
incurred costs of $201.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
 
6.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant




 
relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1)
of the Act. I say this for the following
reasons.
 
7.    
The Landlord has
attempted to work with the Tenants to negotiate a repayment plan. It sent a
letter to the Tenants on April 20, 2021 inviting them to engage in negotiations.
It provided information to them about financial resources available to help
them maintain the tenancy and made a
number of follow up phone calls. The Tenants failed to respond in any way
except to go into the site office in October of 2021 to pick up a copy of the
Landlord’s ledger. The Tenants’
behaviour suggests the Tenants are not interested in saving their tenancy. That
being said, I have also considered the fact that the Tenants have lived in the unit since 2012, and I am cognizant of the difficulties moving at this time
of the year and the reality of the current worldwide pandemic.
 
8.    
Given all of the above, the Board’s standard
eleven-day eviction order shall issue but the issuance of the order shall be
delayed until the new year.
 
9.    
The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,406.00 from the Tenants and this deposit shall be applied to the rent due for the last month of the tenancy
pursuant to s. 106(10) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the ‘Act’).
 
10. 
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
1, 2021 to September 30, 2021.
The interest owing totals $1.06. This amount shall be offset
against the rent and daily compensation owing.
 
11. 
This order contains all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
terminated effective September
30, 2021 pursuant to the Landlord’s N8 notice of termination for
persistent late payment of rent.
 
2.    
The Tenants
must move out of the rental unit on or before January
16, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$2,713.59, which represents the rent arrears
and daily compensation owing up to December 31, 2021, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $46.22
per day for compensation for the use of the unit from January 1, 2022 to
the date they move out of the unit.
 
5.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before January 16, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 17,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.




 
7.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January
17, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 17, 2022.
