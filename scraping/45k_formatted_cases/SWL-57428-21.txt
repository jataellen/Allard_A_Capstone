Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57428-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


1, 420 OXFORD
STREET E LONDON ON N5Y3H4


 




Between:


Kory Mackinnon Yellow House Rentals


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Martin Spencer


Tenant



 
 
 
Kory Mackinnon and Yellow
House Rentals (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Martin Spencer (the 'Tenant') and for an order to
have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet
a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on December 2, 2021 with
respect to application SWL-54044-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlords could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following condition
specified in the order: the Tenant did not pay $200.00 on or before
December 3, 2021.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the
Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlords are entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$5,432.80 for rent arrears in Order
SWL-54044-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $5,432.80 and that amount
is included in this
order. As a result, the portion of previous order related to rent arrears
SWL-54044-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
The Tenancy was terminated by the order
SWL-54044-21 issued December
2, 2021 and remains in full force and effect.
 
It is ordered that:




File Number: SWL-57428-21
 
 
 
1.     The previous order SWL-54044-21 paragraph 5 is cancelled. The remainder of the order remains in effect.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords
$5,432.80*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to November 30, 2021.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords
$28.77 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting December 1, 2021
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlords the full amount
owing* on or before January
25, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.

The tenant has until January 24, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 24, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on July 26, 2022 if
the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
