  matter of:


2007, 28 HARRISON GARDEN
BOULEVARD TORONTO ON M2N7B5




Between:


Angela Sardo

and




 


Zahra Haji-abutorab



 
 
Angela Sardo and Danny Tieu (the 'Tenants') applied
for an order determining that Zahra Haji- abutorab (the 'Landlord') has
collected or retained money illegally.
 
This application was heard by way of videoconference on December 9, 2021. The Tenant Danny Tieu and his legal representative
Daniel McIntyre attended the hearing. Along with the Landlord and her spouse,
Kaveh Zahedi.
 
It is determined that:
 
1.   
The Tenants
withdrew the claim
related to an illegal charge
as it was outside the one
year limitation period set out in subsection
135(4) of the Residential
Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’)
 
Uncontested Facts
 
2.   
The Landlord
and Tenants entered
into a fixed term lease which expired
on February 28, 2019.
 
3.   
In November 2018 the Tenants
agreed to a rent increase from $1,650.00 to $1,800.00 effective February
1, 2019, not knowing that this was an increase
in excess of the amount allowed by the Act. The Landlord did not serve the Tenant with a Notice of Rent Increase
before increasing the rent.
 
4.    The Landlord collected
$1,800.00 in rent each month from February
1, 2019 until March 1, 2020.
 
5.    The Landlord did not contest
this increase occurred,
nor that that this money
was collected in excess of
the amount permitted by the Act.




 
 
 
6.    The Tenants moved out at the end of March 2020, and the last month’s rent deposit was applied to the rent due for March
2020.
 
Rent increases – Law and
analysis
 
7.    The relevant provisions of the Act are:
 
110 No landlord shall increase the rent charged
to a tenant for a rental unit, except
in accordance with this Part.
 
111 (1) No landlord
shall charge rent for a rental unit in an amount that is greater than the lawful rent permitted
under this Part.
 
116 (1) A landlord
shall not increase
the rent charged
to a tenant for a rental unit without first giving the tenant at
least 90 days written notice of the landlord’s intention to do so.
 
(2) 
Subsection (1) applies even if the rent charged
is increased in accordance with an order under section 126.
 
(3) 
The notice shall be in a form approved
by the Board and shall set out the
landlord’s intention to increase the rent and the amount of the new rent.
 
(4) 
An increase in rent is void if the landlord has not given the notice required by this
section, and the landlord must give a new notice before the landlord can take
the increase.
 
119  (1) A landlord who is lawfully
entitled to increase
the rent charged
to a tenant for a rental unit may do so only if at least 12 months
have elapsed,
 
(a)  
since the day of the last rent increase
for that tenant
in that rental unit, if there
has been a previous increase; or
 
(b)  
since the day the rental unit was first rented to that tenant,
if clause (a) does not apply.
 
Exception
 
(2) An increase in rent under
section 123 shall be deemed not to be an increase
in rent for the purposes of this section
 
120  (1) No landlord may increase the rent charged
to a tenant, or to an assignee under section 95, during the term of their tenancy by more than the
guideline, except in accordance with section 126 or 127 or an agreement under section 121 or 123.




 
135.  (1) A tenant or former tenant of a rental
unit may apply to the Board for an order that the landlord, superintendent or agent of the landlord
pay to the tenant any money the person collected or
retained in contravention of this Act or the Tenant Protection
Act, 1997.
Time limitation
 
(4) No order
shall be made under this section with respect to an application filed more than one year after the person collected
or retained money in contravention of this Act or the Tenant Protection Act, 1997.
135.1 
(1) An increase
in rent that would otherwise be void under subsection 116
(4) is deemed not to be void if the tenant has paid the increased
rent in respect of each rental
period for at least 12 consecutive months.
136 (1) Rent charged
one or more years earlier
shall be deemed
to be lawful rent unless an
application has been made within one year after the date that amount was first
charged and the lawfulness of the rent charged is in issue in the application.
8.    The annual guideline rent increase for 2018 was
1.8%.
 
9.    The increase in the rent from $1,650.00 to $1,800.00
effective February 1, 2019 was contrary to sections
110 and 111 of the Act because
the Landlord failed
to serve a notice
of rent increase at least 90 days in advance
as required by section 116, and because
the rent increase of $150.00 was greater than the 2018 rent increase
guideline of 1.8% (s.120).
 
10. The increase in rent was not made in accordance with section 126 or 127 or an agreement under section 121 or 123 of the Act.
 
11. Although the Landlord did not provide notice of
increased rent in a form approved by the Board, but rather advised the Tenant
of the increased rent via e-mail, in contravention of section 116 of the Act,
section 135.1 (1) provides that an increase in rent that would otherwise be void under subsection 116 (4) is deemed not to be void if the tenant
has paid the increased rent
in respect of each rental period for at least 12 consecutive months.
 
12. However, the Tenants
filed this application challenging the lawfulness of the rent increase
on January 29, 2020, which is within the one year period of the illegal rent
first being charged and the lawfulness of the rent charged is in issue in this
application.
 
13. Therefore, the rent increase was illegal at the time it was imposed, and sections 135.1 and
section 136 do not apply here to cause the increase to be deemed not void.
 
14. Accordingly, a total of $1,950.00 in illegal rent was collected between from February
1, 2019 until February 1, 2020.




 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
15. The Landlord shall pay to the Tenants
the sum of $1,950.00. This amount represents
$1,950.00 in excess rent due for the period
of February 1, 2019 to February 1, 2020.
 
16. The Landlord shall also pay to the Tenant $53.00
for the cost of filing
the application
 
17. The total amount
the Landlord owes to the Tenant is
$2,003.00.
 
18. If the Landlord does not pay the Tenants the full
amount owing by February 21, 2022, the Landlord will owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February
22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the outstanding
balance.
 
19. The Tenants have the right, at any time, to collect the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
