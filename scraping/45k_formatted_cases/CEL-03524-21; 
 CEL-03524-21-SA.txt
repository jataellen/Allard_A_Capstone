Order under Section
78(11)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-03524-21-SA
 
 



In the matter
of:


LOWER, 43 ADELAIDE STREET BARRIE ON L4N3T4


 




Between:


Dom Petta


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Earling
Trudeau


Tenant



 
 
 
Dom Petta (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Earling Trudeau (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant
owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on July
19, 2021 with respect to application CEL-97801-21.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved by order CEL-03524-21,
issued on July 19, 2021. The Tenant filed a motion to set aside order
CEL-03524-21.
 
This motion was heard by video conference on January 12, 2022.
 
The Landlord's Legal Representative, C. De Palma and the Tenant
attended the hearing. The Tenant spoke with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     Order CEL-97801-21 provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain conditions
specified in the order.
 
2.    
The Landlord filed the
application under section 78 of the Act, alleging that the Tenant failed to pay
the monthly rent on October 1, 2021, and arrears of $1,977.75 on October 20,
2021, contrary to order CEL-97801-21.
This resulted in the issuance of ex parte order CEL-03524-21 terminating the
tenancy.
 
3.     In support of the motion to set aside the
order, the Tenant testified that he failed to make the payments because his
hours at work were reduced due to the pandemic and he subsequently lost his job
in December 2021. The Tenant has resided in the rental unit since July 2019 and
expects to receive employment insurance benefits of $900.00 every two weeks
commencing a week or two after the hearing.

4.    
The
Tenant, who resides with his wife and three
children and receives $1,100.00 child tax benefit, requested an opportunity to continue the tenancy by making a payment of
$500.00 on
January 20, 2022, $1,000.00 on February 20, 2022 etc. towards the arrears and
the payment of the monthly rent on the first day of each month.
 
5.    
The Tenant’s evidence
at the hearing is at odds with his motion filed on November 19, 2021 where he
stated that he had secured another job after his hours were reduced and was
‘working 44 hours so I am able to start getting caught up’. Although the Tenant stated that he could not pay the rent
because he had to get food for his family, he had additional income from the
child tax benefit.
 
6.    
Based on all the
evidence, there is no dispute that the Tenant breached the order to pay the
rent on the first day of the month and arrears of $1,977.75 on October 20,
2021. In addition, the Tenant has
failed to pay any rent from November 2021 to January 2022. While the amount
owed initially was $7,911.00, as of the date of the hearing, that amount has
increased to $8,277.75.
 
7.    
I have considered all the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 78(11)
(b) of the Act and find that it would be unfair to grant the
Tenant’s motion. Although the Tenant
proposed a plan to make the outstanding payments to the Landlord, having failed
to pay ongoing rent and arrears after September 20, 2021, I am not satisfied
that the Tenant will comply if his payment plan is granted.
 
It
is ordered that:
 
1.    
The motion to set aside
Order CEL-03524-21, issued on July 19, 2021, is denied. The order is confirmed
and remains unchanged.
 
2.    
The stay of order
CEL-03524-21 is lifted on January
31, 2021.
