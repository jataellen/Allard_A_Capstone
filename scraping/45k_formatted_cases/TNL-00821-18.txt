Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-00821-18



 


 


 



 
EGL
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict JA
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes
(‘L1 application’), and because the Tenant has been persistently
late in paying his rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date (‘L2 application’).
 
This
combined application was heard in Toronto on January 19, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s legal representative, BR, and the Tenant attended
the hearing.
 
 Determinations:
 
1.     The
Tenant has not paid the total rent he was required to pay for the period from
December 1, 2017 to January 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination.  Neither the existence nor the amount of the
arrears is disputed by the Tenant. The arrears to the end of
January, 2018 currently total $1,159.32, which is the rent for the month of
January.
2.     The
evidence discloses that this is a monthly tenancy, and rent is due on the first
day of each month.  The evidence before me reveals that the Tenant has not paid
the full rent when due in 11 of the 12 months during the period from January,
2017 to November, 2017.  I am satisfied that the Tenant has been persistently
late in the payment of rent, and this is not disputed by the Tenant.
3.     As
I indicated at the hearing, I am satisfied that, in the circumstances of this
case, the payment plan proposed by the Tenant is reasonable and fair.  While
many N4 notices were served in 2017, the Tenant has not previously been subject
to an order requiring him to pay the rent in full and on time.  The Tenant’s
undisputed testimony is that he has lived in the unit for two years, and that
there were no problems with the tenancy until the Tenant experienced problems
with his income in 2017 as a result of inconsistent available work. 
Furthermore, although he has frequently paid his rent late over the past year,
he has shown good faith by paying the rent, often within the month it became
due, and has not allowed large arrears to accumulate.  He states that his
anticipated income from self-employment will increase because of positive
developments in the kind of work available to him.  He offered to arrange for
pre-authorized debit payment of his rent starting in March.  The payment plan
proposed will see the arrears repaid quickly and, if complied with, will see
the Tenant back on track with regular and timely rent payments by March, 2018. 
He should be given a final opportunity to preserve the tenancy, but only if he
complies with the conditions set out in this order.
4.     In
order to balance the interests of the Landlord, section 78 of the Act will
apply so that, if the Tenant fails to make any of the payments set out below,
the Landlord will be entitled to apply to the Board, within 30 days of default
and without further notice to the Tenant, to terminate the tenancy and evict
the Tenant.
5.     I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the
conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of
the Act.
6.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,138.83 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
7.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from December 1, 2017
to January 22, 2018.
 
8.      The
Tenant paid $1,138.83 after the application was filed.
It is ordered that:
 
L1 application
 
1.     Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before January 31, 2018.
2.     As
of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation
the Landlord is entitled to by $303.29*.
3.     However,
the Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the
Landlord owes the Tenant:
$38.11 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 23,
2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit, and
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
4.     The
Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as
a result of this order.
5.     If
the unit is not vacated on or before January 31, 2018, then starting February
1, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
6.     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 1,
2018.
7.     If,
on or before January 31, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $1,349.32** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit, subject to the conditions set out below. If this payment is not
made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.     The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 1, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
L2 application
 
9.      If
the Tenant voids the Order for termination as set out in paragraph 7 above, the
tenancy shall continue provided the Tenant:
 
(a)  pays
to the Landlord the full monthly rent for the month of February, 2018 on or
before February 15, 2018; and 
 
(b)  pays
the full monthly rent to the Landlord on or before the first business day of
each month for the period from March, 2018 to February, 2019, both inclusive.
 
10.   If the
Tenant fails to make any of the payments under paragraph 9, above, the Landlord
may apply under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’), within 30 days of the breach, without notice to the Tenant, for an
order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant.
