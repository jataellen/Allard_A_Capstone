pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
3.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before March 1, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 2, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 1, 2022, then starting
March 2, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
