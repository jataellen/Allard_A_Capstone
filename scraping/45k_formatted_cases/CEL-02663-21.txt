and


 




 


Jeremy Schultz Meghan Schultz


Tenants



 
 
Diana Downs and Chris Downs (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Jeremy Schultz and Meghan
Schultz (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021. Only the Landlords’ Legal Representative, Melissa Dirubbo,
attended the hearing. As of 12:37 p.m., the Tenants were not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to December
31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective August 18, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
vacated the rental
unit on November 30, 2021. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,400.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of November
30, 2021, the date the Tenants returned vacant possession of the rental
unit to the Landlords.
