Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Andre
Denomme Brandy Cort Carrie Pink


Tenants



 
 
 
786 Hamdani Ltd
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Brandy
Cort, Andre Denomme and Carrie Pink (the 'Tenants') because they or another
occupant of the rental unit have committed an illegal act or have carried out, or permitted
someone to carry out an illegal trade, business or occupation
in the rental unit or the residential complex involving the production of an
illegal drug, the trafficking in an illegal drug or the possession of an
illegal drug for the purposes of trafficking.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 1, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s agent, J. Corrigan,
and the Tenant,
C. Pink, attended
the hearing. The Tenant
spoke to TDC M. Obasekii prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord served
the Tenants an N6 notice of termination alleging that the Tenants, or another occupant of the rental unit
committed an illegal act, or permitted someone to carry out an illegal trade, business or occupation in the rental
unit or the residential complex involving the production, trafficking or
possession for the purposes of trafficking, of an illegal drug.
 
2.    
The allegations in the N6 notice of termination did not allege
trafficking nor the production
of illegal drugs for the purposes
of trafficking. Consequently, I found that the N6 notice
of termination was defective, and therefore the application will be dismissed.




File Number: SOL-23685-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord's application is dismissed.
