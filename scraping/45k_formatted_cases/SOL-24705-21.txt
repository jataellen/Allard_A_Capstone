Tenant



 
 
Sean Van Aman (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict James Peschke (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay
the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 14, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Carmen Dawdy,
attended the hearing.
As of 2:59 p.m. the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from June 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective August 1,
2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant
vacated the rental
unit on November
24, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,900.00.
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,900.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent
deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 21, 2020 to December 31,
2020.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy is
terminated as of November 24, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant possession
of the rental unit to the Landlord.




File Number: SOL-24705-21
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $9,120.76*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to November 24, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 3, 2022, the
Tenant will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from February 4, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
