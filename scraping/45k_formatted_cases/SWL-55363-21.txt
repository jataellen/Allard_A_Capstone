Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55363-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


407, 396 QUEENS AVENUE LONDON ON N6B1X8


 




Between:


Hazelview Property Services Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Brenda Trigger Emily Jane Brown


Tenants



 
 
 
Hazelview Property Services Inc.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Brenda Trigger
and Emily Jane Brown (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 13, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Representative, John
Edlund, attended the hearing. As of 2:03 p.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from March 15, 2021 to January 14, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective August 30, 2021.
 
2.     The monthly rent is $1,415.00.
 
3.     The only amount outstanding
is $40.00 in rent arrears and the Landlord's cost of filing the application. As a result, the order will be limited
to arrears and costs only and not eviction.
 
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlord $40.00, which represents the amount of rent owing up to January 31, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.




File Number: SWL-55363-21
 
3.    
If the Tenants do not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing on or before February 1, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 2,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
