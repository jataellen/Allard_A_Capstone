54 LORNA DRIVE
SAULT STE MARIE ON P6A6H5


 




Between:

Group


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Amy Jones Charlene Jones


Tenants



 
 
 
Grandview Gardens C/o The Silver
Group (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Amy Jones
and Charlene Jones (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard
via videoconference on August 19, 2021 at 9:00 a.m.
 
Only the Landlord, represented by Mark Silver, an employee, attended
the hearing. As at 10:07
a.m. neither of the Tenants,
Amy Jones and Charlene Jones,
were present or represented at the
hearing though being properly served with the Notice of Hearing by the Board.
The hearing proceeded without the Tenants
at 10:07 a.m.
 
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.    
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from February 1, 2021 to August
31, 2021. Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
March 19, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
were in possession of the rental
unit when the application
was filed.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is
$943.79
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $908.99 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from December
18, 2018 to March 19, 2021.




 
 
 
6.    
The Tenants
paid $1,150.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.    
As of the hearing
date, the Tenant owed the Landlord, $4,773.86
including arrears of rent
to August 31, 2021 of $4,587.86 and the application fee of $186.00. Since the
hearing, another five rental periods have begun, and five more month’s rent
have become due. Therefore, the amount in this order includes September 2021,
October 2021, November 2021, December 2021 and January 2022’s rent. If the
Tenant has paid the Landlord September 2021, October 2021, November 2021,
December 2021 and January 2022’s rent, and /or made any payments to the
Landlord since the hearing, the Landlord shall deduct those payments from the
amount owing in this order.
 
8.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenants did not attend the hearing
to present evidence or submissions in support
of granting relief from eviction and no circumstances were disclosed at
the hearing or appeared in the Board file.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 17, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$7,660.83*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 6, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $31.03
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 7, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
17, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 18,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January
18, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 18, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 17, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $9,492.81** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the




 
tenancy would
not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that
the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after January
18, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
