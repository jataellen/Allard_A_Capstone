In the matter of:      1199 RIVER ROAD

Between:                  Alison Lynch                                    Landlord
 
 
and
 




John Bell Mariah Calder


Tenants




 
 
 
Alison Lynch (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Mariah Calder and John Bell (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on April 21, 2021 and October 29, 2021.
 
The Landlord and the Tenants
attended the hearing on April 21, 2021. The Tenants spoke with Duty Counsel
prior to the start of the hearing.
The hearing was adjourned as additional time was
required to complete the hearing.
 
At the return of the matter
on October 29, 2021, the Landlord and the Tenants
attended. The Tenants spoke
with Duty Counsel prior to the start of the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay
for the period from October 1, 2020 to
October 31, 2021. Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
October 17, 2020.
 
2.       
The parties agree the Tenants vacated
the rental unit on December
13, 2020. The parties
also agree the Landlord gave the
Tenants $1,850.00 in cash on December 13, 2020. The Tenants were in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
 
Disputed Settlement Agreement
 
3.       
The Tenants allege that after the
within application was filed, the Landlord agreed if the Tenants moved out they would receive
$1,850.00, all arrears
would be waived,
and there would be no legal
proceedings.




 
4.       
The Landlord agreed that on
December 8, 2020, she offered not to
pursue legal action if the
Tenants left by December 11, 2022. However,
she also asserted
what was ultimately agreed to was to pay the
Tenants $1,850.00 if they found a place to live. The Landlord contends there
was no agreement to waive arrears or to not pursue legal proceedings tied to
the Tenants vacating on December 13, 2020.
 
5.       
The Tenants do not dispute they
were originally to vacate on December 11, 2020, but assert they reached an oral
agreement to accommodate them leaving on December 13, 2020 and that this agreement still involved the parties walking
away from the outstanding
issues.
 
6.       
There was extensive evidence
heard over two days. I have considered this evidence and focused my reasons below on that
which is most relevant.
 
Email Communications
 
7.       
The parties both rely on email
communications they exchanged. Two email chains are central to my determination regarding what agreement
was reached. I have reproduced what I consider the most
relevant excerpts from these chains below.
 
8.       
The first chain of emails includes
the following: Landlord -
December 8, 2020, at 7:25 p.m:
As I said, here is my final offer:
 
I will waive the rent monies
currently owed to me – currently $5,550.00 and I will provide you with $500.00 cash to be out of my house by Friday,
December 11th, at 6:00pm.
 
If you do not vacate the home of 1199
River Road, Lindsay as I mentioned
to you, I will be continuing with the eviction process and pursuing
legal action to have all monies owed to me paid. This will be detailed in
court.
 
Tenants - December 9, 2020 at 6:02 pm:
 
I thought ur last offer was ur final offer.??I’d like to counter
your offer as such ;
$2500 cash money and
documentation stating all monies owed are paid and no further civil legal action will be pursued in relation to use living
at 1199 River Rd….
 
Landlord - December 9, 2020, at 7:16 pm:
 
I will not be accepting your counter offer.
 
The offer I have made is more than fair
and beneficial for you. After Friday the 11th
of December I have advised my lawyer to proceed with the LTB as well as small
claims court. …




 
 
 
Tenants - December 9, 2020, at 7:58 pm:
 
…We have determined that $2,490 would be sufficient amount of money
for us to vacate by Friday, …my offer still stands.
 
Landlord - December 10, 2020, at 8:57 am:
 
…
 
I will return
your last months rent of $1850.00 and waive all damage fees for any minor deficiencies done to the home, seeing as you have never granted me access
to 1199 River Road, Lindsay for inspection.
 
I will do a walk though
inspection of the house on Friday, December
11 at 6:00pm prior to releasing the money.
…
 
Landlord - December 10, 2020, at 10:46 am:
 
This is a written
agreement between Mariah,
yourself and I there is no
reason why I would not follow through.
 
As stated I will pay you $1,850 on Friday, December
11 at 6:00pm after inspection of the empty house with both
yourself and Mariah present.
 
Please return all keys, and the garage door opener at that time.
 
9.       
A further
chain of emails
on December 13, 2020, includes
the following: Tenants -
December 13, 2020 at 8:37 am:
Hello allison
we will require that money before we move anything. One we have it
we are able to leave
. And we will be gone a couple hours after receiving money Landlord - December 13,
2020, at 8:41 am:
Currently you guys owe me $5,500.00. I’m not willing
to give you any more money
until I have walked through an empty house and see your items being put on the
uhaul truck.
 
I will give you the money once you are out. I have walked through
to check damages and I have
the keys and garage door opener in my hand.
 
Tenants - December 13, 2020 at 8:44 am:




 
We are not leaving
then. We will need the money as we are loading the truck. we can’t leave with out the money and not
going to start without it. The truck will go back to uhaul I don’t we need the
money before house is empty.
 
Landlord - December 13, 2020 at 8:46 am:
 
If you require a deposit to get the uhaul, I will provide
that. That’s it.
 
All of this is in writing,
as I have said before it is a written
agreement. I will follow
through, as I always have.
 
Analysis
 
10.    Overall, I found the details of the Tenants’ oral
evidence unreliable. However, what was consistent was their understanding there was an agreement that permitted them to leave on December 13, 2020, with a waiver
of all arrears and no legal proceedings.
 
11.    In order to clarify whether such an agreement existed,
I have relied on the Landlord’s oral testimony regarding her
interpretation of events and the email communications themselves.
 
12.    The Landlord testified
there was an earlier agreement that if the Tenants left on the 11th she
would not go forward with any legal action to pursue the arrears. The
Landlord’s position was that because the Tenants did not leave at 6:00 pm on
December 11 they now owe all arrears.
 
13.   
As a result,
I understand the written agreement in the first email chain to be that if the Tenants left on December 11 at 6:00
pm, the Landlord would provide them with
$1,850.00, and waive all arrears with no legal
proceedings.
 
14.    The Landlord testified there was no new agreement. The Landlord testified
she gave the Tenants $1,850.00 on December 13,
2020, to vacate as they would not leave without it, to minimize the stress to
her family, and because the police told her that they would not attend with her
at the rental unit going forward. The Landlord also testified that on December
13, 2020, the Tenants would have known the agreement was for them to vacate on
December 11, 2020.
 
15.    The Landlord’s testimony
there was no new agreement
is in contrast to what she wrote on December 13, 2020.
 
16.    The Landlord’s December
13, 2020, email at 8:46 am clearly
states there is an
agreement in writing and that this has been stated before.
 
17.   
The only other email I was provided where
there is reference
an agreement in writing is the Landlord’s December
10 email at 8:46 am. This email is in the agreement
that if the Tenants vacated on December 11 at 6:00pm they would receive
a waiver of arrears, there would be no legal proceedings, and they would
receive $1,850.00.




 
18.   
Additionally, the Landlord’s December
13, 2020 email
at 8:41 am says, “I will give you the money once you are out….” The amount
given to the Tenants on December 13, 2020 was $1,850.00. This is the same
amount agreed to in the earlier communications.
 
19.    The Landlord’s emails support the interpretation there
was an agreement with the same terms as before
but with a new vacation date of December 13, 2020. As the emails were drafted by the Landlord, any ambiguity is to be interpreted in favour of the Tenants.
If the Landlord did not
intend for there to be a waiver of arrears and legal proceedings, this should
have been clearly articulated and is not something which the Landlord can now
assert was known to the Tenants.
 
20.    On the balance of probabilities
I find the evidence supports the Tenants’ interpretation there was an agreement
the Landlord would provide the Tenants with $1,850.00 when they vacated on December 13, 2020,
that all arrears would be waived, and that there would be no legal proceedings.
 
21.    As a result,
the Landlord’s application is dismissed.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.       
The tenancy is terminated as of December
13, 2020, the date the Tenants gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.       
The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
