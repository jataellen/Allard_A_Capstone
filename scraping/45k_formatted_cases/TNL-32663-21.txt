Order under Section

Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-32663-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


3, 63 GARTHDALE COURT COURT TORONTO
  ON M3H5P7


 




Between:


Ruvini Gomez


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Nandrani
Sukhdeo


Tenant



 
 
 
Ruvini Gomez (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Diana Deo-
Maraj, Nandrani Sukhdeo
and Brandon Deo-Maraj
(the 'Tenants') because
the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for
the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application
was heard on January 6, 2022. The
Landlord, represented by Bavithra Vigneswararajah, and the Tenant,
represented by Sobini Tharmalingam, attended
the hearing.
 
Diana Deeo-Maraf and Brandon Deo-Maraj
have been removed
as named tenants
as they are the children of the Tenant.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s son is a student who has been living near the university. Due to the pandemic, he is now living at home.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s son testified he intends to live in the upstairs
three-bedroom unit with two
other friends. He is currently living
in one of his mother’s rooms. There
are now three people living in his mother’s home.
 
3.    
The Tenant’s
representative points to a request
from the Landlord
to increase the rent as a sign of bad faith.
 
4.    
The Landlord testified
that she did not increase the rent for seven years since 2009 and that after
the Tenant’s divorce she was attempting to help the Tenant by continuing the
tenancy. However, her son is now 21 years of age and wants to have a place of his own.
 
5.    
The Tenant’s
representative argues that the rental
unit is on the upper floor and that the Landlord’s son had knee surgery and
would have problems with the stairs.




 
6.    
The surgery was in
August 2020. The Tenant’s son
testified that his knee is better now, and the stairs
are not an issue. I find it unlikely, after
this much time has passed,
that the knee surgery would be
an issue accessing the upper floor.
 
7.    
I find the Landlord
in good faith
requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
8.    
The Landlord
paid the Tenant compensation equal
to one month's rent.
 
9.    
The Tenant requested a
delay in the termination of the tenancy. I
have considered the following factors. The
notice was served by the Landlord on May 27, 2021 with a termination date of
July 31, 2021, more than six months prior to this hearing; the fact the
Tenant’s representative submits the Tenant did not find alternative
accommodations because the Tenant was going to challenge the Landlord’s
application, despite later stating that the Tenant had been looking
for another place to live; and the fact the Tenant
has resided in the unit since 2009. I
find it is fair to delay the termination of the tenancy as requested. Under the circumstance the delay will be
until April 30, 2022 to provide additional time for the Tenant to locate
alternative accommodations for her and the child who now lives with her.
 
10.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until April 30, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated, as of April 30, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the
rental unit on or before April 30, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before April 30, 2022, then starting May 1, 2022,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after May 1, 2022.
