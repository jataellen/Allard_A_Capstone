File Number: TNL-35043-21
 
 



In the
matter of:


1614, 2801 JANE STREET NORTH YORK ON M3N2H8


 




Between:


Starlight Canadian Residential Growth Fund


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Cosmo Petgrave


Tenant



 
Starlight Canadian Residential
Growth Fund (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Cosmo
Petgrave (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
24, 2022. The Landlord's Legal Representative, Sean Beard, and the
Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
June 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective September
29, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,197.66
as of January 1, 2022
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,175.48 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit has been paid to the Tenant
for the period
from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020.
 
6.    
The Tenant paid $3,000.00
after the application was filed.
 
7.     The $20.00
NSF cheque charge was not substantiated, therefore the charge was denied.
 
8.    
I have considered
all of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find
that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the
conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of
the Act.




 
9.    
The Tenant states that he sent
payment to the Landlord in the amount of $2,000.00, however the Landlord has not received
this payment yet. This amount
has not been taken
into account in the calculations of the amount owing under this order, but it
does constitute the payment due on January 28, 2022 in the payment plan below.
 
10.  The amount outstanding to January 31, 2022,
inclusive of rent arrears ($5,295.30) and costs ($186.00), is $5,481.30.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$5,481.30, which represents the arrears of rent
($5,295.30) and costs ($186.00) outstanding for the period ending January 31,
2022.
 
2.     The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant
is denied on the condition
that:
 
(a)  
The Tenant shall make the following
payments to the Landlord in respect of the
monies owing under paragraph 1 of this order:

the first day of each
corresponding month.

If the Tenant fails
to make any of the payments in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates required, then:
 
(a)  
The Landlord may apply
under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for
an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, and for the payment
of any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not already ordered under paragraph
1 of this order. The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a
breach of a condition set out in paragraph 2 of this order.
 
(b)  
The balance owing under paragraph 1 of this order shall become payable
on the day following
the date of default. The monies owing
shall bear interest
at the post- judgment interest rate determined under subsection 207(7)
of the Act.
