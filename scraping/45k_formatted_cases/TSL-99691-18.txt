Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-99691-18










 

J.L
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict R.C
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. (L1
application)
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evicting the
Tenant because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's
rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date. (L2 application)
 
This
combined application was heard in Toronto on November 20, 2018. Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
 
I was satisfied that the parties were properly served with the
Notice of Hearing and that the Tenant was aware of the hearing as scheduled.
 
The Tenant had requested that another matter (TST-98042-19) be
rescheduled to be combined with this matter at this hearing.  However, that
request was denied by the Board.
 
Although there is an email from the Landlord consenting to
combining the two applications to be heard at another date, there is no
evidence of a further request by the Tenant to adjourn this matter.
 
As such, I am satisfied that the parties ought to be aware of this
hearing and be ready to proceed as scheduled.
 
This matter was scheduled for a hearing at 9:30 AM.  I waited
until 10:37 AM and proceeded with the hearing without the Tenant in attendance.
 
The Landlord’s application is amended to reflect that the last
month rent deposit was collected by on September 1, 2018.
 
Determinations:
 
            L1 application
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from August 1, 2018 to November 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 25, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant is in possession of
the rental unit. 
3.      The monthly rent as of the date of the hearing is $1,800.00.
4.      The
Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
5.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,800.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
6.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 1,
2017 to September 25, 2018.
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
L2
application
8.      On
September 11, 2018, the Landlord served the Tenant a Notice to Terminate at End
of the Term for persistent late payment of rent (the ‘N8 notice’) with a
termination date of November 30, 2018. 
9.      The
Landlord had stated in the Notice that the Tenant was late in paying his rent
for June 2018, by paying the Landlord in two installments on May 1 and May 3,
2018.
10.   If the
Tenant had paid the rent for June 2018 in May 2018, then the Tenant could not
have been late for that month.
11.   At the
hearing, the Landlord admitted that this was a mistake.  As such, I am satisfied
that the N8 notice is defective and as a result the Landlord’s L2 application
shall be dismissed.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Due
to the Canada Post strike, the Landlord, upon receipt of this order must give a
copy of this order to the Tenant by a method set out in subsection 191(1) of
the Act, other than by sending it by mail or courier to the last known address
where the Tenant resides or carries on business.
2.      The
L2 application is dismissed.
3.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before December 4, 2018.
4.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4,936.44*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to November 23, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
5.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $59.18 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting November 24, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
6.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
7.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
December 4, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from December 5, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
8.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before December 4, 2018, then starting December
5, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after December 5,
2018.
10.   If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $7,390.00 if the payment is made on or before November 30, 2018, or
ii)       $9,190.00 if the payment is made on or before December 4, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
11.   The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after December 5, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
