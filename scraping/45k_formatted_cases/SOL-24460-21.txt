and


 




 


Jessica Nichol-Ayles


Tenant



 
 
 
Skyline Living
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jessica
Nichol- Ayles (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant,
another occupant of the rental
unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential
complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant.
 
This
application was heard via videoconference on January 5, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s legal representative, R. Hussein, and the Landlord’s witness, T.
Timbers, attended the hearing. As of 9:58 a.m., the Tenant was not present or
represented although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord served an
N5 notice on the Tenant on August 23, 2021.
 
2.    
The conduct alleged in the N5 pertain to: excessive noise
in the form of yelling
and arguing from the Tenant’s
unit; the Tenant’s guests loitering, smoking, littering and
harassing/intimidating other tenants
in the common areas; the Tenant used a blowtorch
on the baseboards of her unit to draw out pests; and the Tenant threw
items off her balcony.
T. Timbers,
the Landlord’s Residential Manager, testified to having received complaints
from other tenants regarding these events. He stated he
received a number of complaints regarding the Tenant and
her guests and continues to get complaints to date.
 
3.     T. Timbers testified that on August 28, 2021, he
attended the Tenant’s unit after she complained about pests. On this date, he
saw new burn marks on the floor and the fire department was contacted to
inspect the Tenant’s unit.




 
4.    
Subsection 64 (1) of the Act states:
 
A landlord
may give a tenant notice
of termination of the tenancy
if the conduct of the tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the tenant is
such that it substantially interferes with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex for all usual purposes
by the landlord or another tenant or substantially interferes
with another lawful right, privilege or interest of the landlord or another
tenant. 2006, c. 17, s. 64 (1).
 
5.    
Subsection 64(3) states that the
notice of termination under subsection (1) is void if the tenant, within
seven days after
receiving the notice,
stops the conduct
or activity or corrects
the omission.
 
6.    
Based on the uncontested evidence
of T. Timbers, I find that the Tenant, her occupants and/or her guests substantially interfered with other tenants’ and the Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment. The conduct
described appears to be significant, persistent and ongoing. I am
also satisfied that the Tenant did not void the notice as the Tenant was found
to have continued burning parts of the unit within seven days after the notice
was served.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
8.     The Tenant did not attend to testify to her
circumstances for me to consider delaying or denying eviction. The Landlord was
not aware of any of the Tenant’s circumstances. The Landlord submitted that
after the notice, the tenant made no effort to improve her behaviour. She had
left her dog unleashed in the residential complex, her dog attacked another
dog, she did not clean up after her dog, and a gun was thrown off her patio
from the unit. In consideration of the foregoing, relief will not be granted.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated, as of February 5, 2022. The Tenant must move out
of the rental unit on or before February 5, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing on or before February 5, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 6, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 5, 2022, then starting
February 6, 2022,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction
may be enforced.
 
5.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after February 6, 2022.
