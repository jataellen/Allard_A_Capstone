Order under Sections 30 and 31
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOT-36155-19
 
 
TD (the 'Tenant') applied for an
order determining that RVPI, JD and HJ (the 'Landlords') failed to meet the
Landlords' maintenance obligations under the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), that the Landlords
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or
residential complex by them and that the Landlords withheld or deliberately interfered
with the reasonable supply of a vital service that the Landlords are obligated
to supply under the tenancy agreement.
 
This application was heard on June17,
2021 in VC75 and on July 22, 2021
in Passcode 215 965 491 VC 75. Only the Tenant and the Tenant’s
representative, (‘AB-S’), attended the hearing
on June 17, 2021 and only the Tenant’s
representative, AB-S, attended
the hearing on July 22, 2021.
 
This application is one of 16
related tenant applications against the Landlords concerning the effective shut down of a mobile
home park (the ‘Park’)
and certain maintenance and repair issues leading up to the time of the
effective shut down.
 
Refer to order NOT-33990-18-HR (the ‘Base Order’)
issued February 1, 2022, concurrently with this and the other 14 related individual Tenant
applications. That order sets out my
determinations on the liability of the Landlords pertaining to events
leading up to the Park’s closure and the availability of
remedies related to the closure itself.
 
The application under file number NOT-33990-18 was a multi-tenant T2 application brought on behalf
of fifteen tenants
identified in Schedule
1 to that order (‘Park
Tenants’), seeking relief
for the discontinuance of power to the Park. A separate T6 application and/or T2 application was brought by
each of the fifteen Park Tenants, seeking relief for the Landlords’ actions and
inactions pertaining to the Park’s water supply, the Park’s sewage system and
the effective closure of the Park. This application under file NOT-36155-19 is
one of those applications.




 
The hearing of issues common to
all of the applications, meaning common to the application under file number NOT-33990-18 and the fifteen
individual applications, proceeded to completion on July 22, 2022 in Passcode 215 965 491 VC 75
following a number of earlier appearances.
The hearing of the Tenant’s individual issues under file number NOT-36155-19 proceeded on June
17, 2019. The procedural history is set out in the Base Order.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
As set out in the Base Order, I find that that:
 
a)    
The Landlords withheld or interfered with the provision
of electricity, a vital service;
 
b)     The Landlords failed
to repair or maintain the Park’s sewage
system, allowing problems
with sewage discharges and significant odours over a period that extends back
prior to one year prior to the Tenant’s application filing in April 2019;
 
c)      The Landlords failed
to repair or maintain the Park’s water
system such that the supply of potable water was compromised
for roughly two weeks at the beginning of
March 2018 and throughout the period June through October 2018;
 
d)     The Landlords’ failures
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the units and the Park by the Tenants,
both prior to and after October 2018; and
 
e)    
The above failures, combined with
the Landlords’ decision to cease providing all services at the Park as of October, 2018, attract various
remedies, some pertaining to events leading up to the October 2018 effective closure and
pertaining to events following that effective closure.
 
2.    The Tenant claims for two classes of remedies: first,
those attributable to the wrongdoing
of the Landlords prior to the Park’s effective closure in October 2018; and
second; those attributable to the closure.
 
3.   
I
find the following
facts on the basis of the uncontroverted testimony of the Tenant;
 
a)     The Tenant had lived at the Park for about 20 years before he vacated near the end of
2018 further to the effective closure of the Park
 
b)     The Tenant paid rent of $300.00 per month at the Park up
to and including July 2018;
 
c)     
The Tenant lived in the lower
section of the Park, proximate to the lower pumphouse and septic
system. The smell
from the system
was continuously bad. He often
had to walk around feces from
the road, as the raw sewage from the system would run across the road and into
the river. The smell became particularly bad after the Landlords stopped
pumping the system in the spring of 2018;
 
d)     The reason that the water
was continually shut off in the Park was that only one of the two wells at the Park was
operational. That well, on the upper
portion of the Park,




 
was not designed to supply water to the whole Park,
so it had to be continually shut down to recharge. The water pressure
was very low – often no more than a trickle. Toilets did not work;
 
e)     The Tenant understood, from the repeated assurances he
received from the Landlords leading up to the July 2018 notice, that the
Landlords were taking the appropriate steps to ensure that the regulators were
satisfied and that the Park remained open. The Tenant felt that the Park Tenants
were “duped” by the Landlords into continuing to pay rent;
 
f)      
After the power was shut down in
the Park at the end of October 2018, the Tenant went back and forth between his father’s camp and the Park, in an attempt
to salvage his furniture and
other items such as a washer and dryer and to try to deter vandals He had a
small fireplace which he used at the Park during these visits. He was anxious about the several letters
and notices from Algoma Public Health because of
the Landlords’ failure to address the sewage system;
and
 
g)     The Tenant suffered
a loss of roughly $15,000.00 in the value of his trailer.
 
 
First Type of Remedies - for the Period
Prior to October 30 2018
 
4.   
For the first type of remedies, I have considered compensation for events
occurring between April 23, 2018, being
one year prior
to when this application was filed, and October 31, 2019;
 
5.   
I
find that the Tenant is entitled
to a
rebate of $48.75,
being 5% of the
$300.00 monthly rent at the Park for
the 3 ¼ month period from the last week in April 2018 through July 2018, when
the Tenant stopped paying rent.
 
6.    I find that the impact on the Tenant of the sewage
issues was particularly strong because of his unit’s
proximity to major components of the sewage system. I find that he is entitled
to a rebate of $243.75, being 25% of the $300.00 monthly rent for the 3 ¼ month
period from the last week in April 2018 through
July 2018, when the Tenant stopped
paying rent, for the Landlords’ failure to maintain the sewage system.
 
Second Type of Remedies - Pursuant to the Park Closure
 
7.   
For the second type of remedies, as set out in
the Base Order, I find the following:
 
a)    
The Tenant
is not entitled to compensation for the loss of value of the value of the
mobile home;
 
b)    
The Tenant is entitled
to compensation for out
of pocket costs
attributable to the Park’s
effective closure; and
 
c)     
The Tenant may be entitled to damages for interference with reasonable enjoyment.




 
 
 
8.   
The Tenant’s application sets out various
costs incurred by the Tenant
for staying at his
father’s camp following his departure from the Park. The Tenant provided no oral or
documentary evidence
regarding those costs. I note, also, that the amounts
set out in the application
would amount to monthly expenditures which were lower than the rent which the
Tenant had paid at the Park. I find,
accordingly, that the Tenant cannot be awarded compensation for those costs.
 
9.   
I
find that the Tenant is entitled to damages for interference with reasonable enjoyment. I note that after the Park closed the Tenant made considerable
efforts to salvage his belongings and protect the trailer as best he could
following the Park’s closure. I find
it likely that the situation would have been difficult for him and find that a
damages award of
$1,000.00 is appropriate in the circumstances.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlords shall pay to the Tenant a total of $1,292.50, representing payment for the following:
 
a)    
rent abatement of $292.50
for the impacts of the problems with the water and
sewage systems; and
 
b)     $1,000.00 for damages.
 
2.    
The Landlords shall pay the Tenant the full amount owing by March 31, 2022.
 
3.    
If the Landlords do not pay the
Tenant the full amount owing by March 31, 2022 the Landlords will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from April 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
