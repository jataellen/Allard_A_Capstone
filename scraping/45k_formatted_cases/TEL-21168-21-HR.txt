Order under Section 77(8)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-21168-21-HR
 



In the matter
of:


519 WARDEN AVENUE TORONTO ON M1L3Z2


 




Between:


Parimal Debnath
  Paul Kalidas


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Abdul Raheem Hassan Sala Mohammed Abdul
Karem Ahmed Omar Abdul
  Karim Ahmed Yaqob Ahmed


Tenants



 
 
Parimal
Debnath and Paul Kalidas (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Omar Abdul Karim Ahmed, Yaqob Ahmed, Abdul Raheem Hassan
Sala and Mohammed Abdul Karem Ahmed (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants entered into an agreement to terminate the
tenancy.
 
The
application was heard by video conference on January 28, 2022. The Landlord,
Parimal Debnath attended the hearing. As of 1:34 p.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlords and the Tenants
purportedly signed an Agreement to End the Tenancy with a termination date of December 30,
2021.
2.    
Section 43 (1) (a) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 states that where this Act permits a landlord or tenant to give a
notice of termination, the notice shall, amongst other things, identify the
rental unit for which the notice is given.
3.    
In this case, the notice does not contain
the address of the unit.
As a result, I find the notice defective and the Board will not
issue an order terminating the tenancy without a valid notice of termination.
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
