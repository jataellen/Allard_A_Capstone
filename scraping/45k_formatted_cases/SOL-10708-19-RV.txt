Between:

Judith Ann Blackie Peter James Leonard


Tenants



 
 
Review Order
 
Peter Wolff (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Peter James Leonard and Judith Ann
Blackie (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay compensation for damage they owe because
the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the Board on October 31, 2019 with respect to
application SOL-07541-19.
 
This application was resolved by order SOL-10708-19 issued on November 26, 2019.
On December 27, 2019, the Tenants requested a review of the order.
On January 7, 2020 interim order SOL-07541-19-RV-IN was issued, staying
the order SOL- 10708-19 issued on November 26, 2019,
as the two order were linked.
 
The request was heard via video
conference on October
19, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord’s legal representative, Ilan Shingait attended
the hearing. At 1:51 p.m. the
Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.     Since the Tenants
did not attend the hearing
to support his application, I find that this
application has been abandoned.
 
2.     The Landlord seeks costs for the hearing of the
review. The Landlord’s legal representative seeks cost to the Landlord in the amount
of $150.00, which represents a portion of the legal representative’s
fee.

3.    
The Board has published Interpretation Guideline #3 entitled “Costs”
to assist the parties
to understand how the Board normally approaches issues of costs.
 
“A Member has the discretion to require a party to pay, as costs, any representation
or preparation expenses of another party where the conduct of the party was unreasonable.”
 
4.     I do not have sufficient evidence that the Tenants’ conduct
was unreasonable or caused
delay. Therefore, the Landlord’s request for costs is denied.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The request to review order
SOL-10708-19 issued on November 26, 2019 is denied. The order is confirmed and remains
unchanged.
 
2.     The interim order issued on January 7, 2020 is cancelled. The stay of order SOL-10708- 19 is lifted.
