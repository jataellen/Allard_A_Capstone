In the matter
of:


MAIN FLOOR,
21 CARTIER CRESCENT N RICHMOND HILL ON L4C2M9


 




Between:


Maryam Rashidian


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Peyman Khodadadinejad


Tenant



 
 
Maryam Rashidian (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Peyman Khodadadinejad (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was first heard by videoconference on February 17, 2021 and resolved by order
TNL-29867-20 issued on February 22, 2021.
 
The Tenant
requested a review
of this decision
on March 7, 2021 and this matter
was directed to a review hearing
on the issue of whether
the Tenant was not reasonably able to participate in the February 17,
2021 proceedings.
 
The review
hearing was held on April 21, 2021
by videoconference. The request to review
was granted by order TNL-29867-20-RV-IN issued
April 23, 2021 but the hearing
de novo could not be
heard.
 
The hearing
de novo was
heard by videoconference on December 10,
2021.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s agent
Amir Geran and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Reasons:
 
Rent Arrears
 
1.    
Although there are many facts in dispute between
the parties, the parties agreed that the Tenant returned the keys to the
Landlord and vacated the rental unit on March 1, 2021. The parties also agreed
that the lawful monthly rent was $1,950.00 at all material times.
 
2.     The parties disagreed
about the Tenant’s
payment history and the total amount of rent
outstanding for the period October 1, 2020 to March 1, 2021.




 
3.    
To understand the parties’
disagreement it is helpful to understand the background of this
tenancy. The April 20, 2018 tenancy agreement confirms that the Landlord
collected the
first month’s rent, two last month’s
rent deposits totalling $3,800.00 and a $1,900.00 damage deposit.
 
4.    
The Landlord’s N4 Notice
of Termination asserts
that the Tenant
failed to pay $2,000.00
of the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period October 1, 2020
to November 30, 2020. The N4 asserts a single payment of $1,900.00 in October
2020.
 
5.     The Landlord’s L1 Application, which
was filed on December 29, 2020, asserts
that the Tenant failed to pay
$3,950.00 of the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
October 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. The L1 asserts a single payment of
$1,900.00 in October 2020. The Landlord’s
L1 Application asserts that the Landlord is holding a rent deposit
of $1,900.00 collected
on April 20, 2018 and that no interest has been paid on this deposit.
 
6.    
The dispute between the parties is about how the Landlord
used the various
deposits.
 
7.     The Landlord’s agent and property manager testified
that the Landlord applied the security deposit to June 2020’s rent and that the
Landlord applied both rent deposits to October 2020’s rent (leaving a balance
of $50.00) and November 2020’s rent (leaving a balance of $50.00). In support
of this testimony, the Landlord’s agent introduced a November 1, 2021 e-mail
exchange between himself and the Tenant in which the Landlord acknowledges that
that the Tenant owes $50.00 for October 2020’s rent and where the Tenant replies
asking the Landlord
to apply “my deposit money”
to the rent for November
2020. As expressed by the Landlord’s agent, the Landlord’s ultimate position
was that the Tenant remains responsible for the $100.00 outstanding from
October and November of 2020 and the full rent for the period December 1, 2020
to March 1, 2021 and that he Landlord is no longer holding a rent deposit
because all deposits have been applied.
 
8.    
The Tenant did not disagree that
two of the $1,900.00 deposits were applied to the rent for October
2020 and November
2020. The Tenant’s
dispute is with the Landlord’s claim that one of the deposits was applied to June 2020’s rent.
On this issue, the Tenant
testified that he paid June
2020’s rent to the Landlord’s agent in cash that he borrowed from his sister,
that the Landlord did not provide a receipt and that it was not the Landlord’s practice
to provide rent receipts. The Landlord’s agent
did not cross-examine the Tenant on this
testimony.
 
9.     The Tenant’s sister Parisa Khodadadinejad testified
that she gave her brother $2,000.00 in cash to provide to the Landlord for June
2020’s rent, that she observed her brother hand money to the Landlord’s agent
in June 2020 and that she did not witness the Landlord’s agent provide her
brother with a receipt. On cross-examination, Ms. Khodadadinejad testified that
she came to Canada in February 2020, that she brought money with her and that her husband also sent her money. She admitted that she did not
have a specific receipt to document obtaining $2,000.00 from Iran.




 
10.  I should note that both parties appeared to be under
the impression that they were entitled to make agreements that are contrary
to the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). However, subsection 3(1)
of the Act is clear that the Act applies despite any agreement or waiver to the
contrary and subsection 4(1) is clear that a provision in a tenancy agreement
that is inconsistent with the Act or its regulations is void. On the facts of
this case, these provisions mean the following.
 
11.  The Landlord was only entitled to collect one last
month’s rent deposit and the second deposit was contrary to subsection 106(2)
of the Act and illegal. The Landlord’s damage deposit was contrary to
subsection 105(1) of the Act and illegal. Although the parties were entitled
to agree to apply the illegal deposits to rent as it came due, subsection
106(1) of the Act required the Landlord to apply the rent deposit to the
payment of the rent for the last rent period before the tenancy terminates.
This means that the Landlord is still
holding a last month’s rent deposit despite
any agreement or waiver to the contrary.
 
12.  The remaining question
is whether the Landlord has proven that the
Landlord applied one of the deposits to June 2020’s rent.
If I accept the Landlord’s evidence, two illegal deposits were applied to the
rent for June 2020 and October 2020, the agreement to apply a deposit to
November 2020’s rent is void, the Tenant owes rent for the period November 1,
2020 to March 1, 2021 and the Landlord is still holding the last month’s rent
deposit. If I accept the Tenant’s evidence that he paid June 2020’s rent, two
illegal deposits were applied
to the rent for October
2020 and November
2020, the Tenant
owes rent for the period December 1, 2020 to March 1, 2021 and the
Landlord is still holding
the last month’s rent deposit.
 
13.  In resolving this issue, I am guided by the Divisional Court’s
decision in Mauti v. Gibbs,
2019 ONSC 3355 (CanLII) at para. 27, in part:
 
. . . Legally speaking, an
allegation of arrears is an allegation of breach of the lease or breach of
contract. It is axiomatic that the party who alleges a breach of contract bears
the burden to prove that the counterparty
committed the breach alleged. As it is difficult to prove a negative
(i.e. non-payment of rent), normally someone with appropriate knowledge on
behalf of the landlord will simply testify that no money was received. They
will usually produce copies of contemporaneous books of account that show no
receipts were recorded for specific dates when rent was due as some support for
the oral evidence. While the ultimate persuasive burden never shifts, once a landlord denies receiving funds, the
tenant will have an evidentiary burden or a chance to advance some evidence to
positively prove that he or she paid rent. As only the tenant can prove payment
as a positive fact, this is likely
what Dilks J. meant when he referred to a burden on the tenant to prove payment
of rent. But it is an
evidentiary burden or opportunity to respond. The legal burden of proof is
always on the landlord to prove her case. If the tenant does not adduce
evidence to counter or overcome the landlord's evidence, the landlord may or
may not be found to have met her burden to prove the arrears on a balance
of probabilities. It is
only where neither side is able to convince the presiding board member that the
balance favours one or the other that the burden of proof will be used to
decide the case against the party who bears the burden.




 
14.  The Landlord did not prove on the balance of probabilities that the Landlord
applied one of the illegal
deposits to the rent for June 2020 for the following reasons.
 
15.  First, there was a material inconsistency between the
testimony of the Landlord’s agent and the Landlord. The Landlord’s agent
testified that the Landlord applied the security deposit to June 2020’s rent
and the rent deposits to October 2020 and November 2020’s rent. In contrast, the Landlord testified
that she applied
a rent deposit to June 2020’s rent. If there was an agreement between
the parties to apply one of the deposits to the rent for June 2020 I would have
expected the Landlord and the Landlord’s agent to provide consistent testimony
on the details of the agreement.
 
16.  Second, the Landlord’s evidence was also inconsistent in that the Landlord’s agent testified that the Tenant
did not pay the rent for December
2020, January 2021 and
February 2021 but that the police report of December 12, 2020 introduced by the
Landlord provides as follows, in part:
 
RASHIDIAN stated that she wanted her January rent.
She was upset
and stated that not having
had her rent was a financial burden on herself, and her family.
RASHIDIAN did say that rent was currently up to date for December, and that usually the
rent was due on the 1st of
each month.
 
17.  The Landlord introduced this document to rebut the
Tenant’s claim of harassment, discussed in greater detail below. In so doing,
the Landlord asked me to accept the observations of the author as true. If I do
so, and where both parties agreed that the Tenant’s only payments after October
2020 were applications of deposits, it is difficult to understand why the
Landlord told the police that the Tenant’s rent was up to date for December 2020 unless it is also the case that the Landlord attempted
to apply one of
the deposits to the rent for December 2020. In circumstances where the
Landlord collected three deposits and where the Landlord had already attempted
to apply two deposits to
the rent for October
2020 and November
2020, the Landlord’s reporting to the police only makes sense if no deposit was
applied to June 2020’s rent.
 
18.  Third, the Landlord did not present a ledger,
statement of account, receipt book or any other documentary evidence to support the Landlord’s claim that the Landlord applied
a
deposit to the rent for June 2020.
Contrary to the example of the parties
e-mail exchange of November
1, 2020 discussed above, the Landlord did not introduce documentary evidence of
any communications between the parties in which the application of the security
deposit to June 2020’s rent was discussed. When the Tenant asked the Landlord’s
agent on cross-examination why he could not produce any documentary evidence to
support this claim the answer provided was not responsive to the question:
the Landlord’s agent asserted
that the Tenant asked to use the last two months and that
the Tenant promised to pay.
 
19.  Fourth, at the hearing the Landlord asserted that a
rent deposit was applied to November 2020’s rent and that the Tenant owed
$50.00 for this month. The Landlord relied on a November 1, 2020 e-mail to
prove this point. However, the Landlord’s L1 dated December 29, 2020 asserts
that the Tenant paid nil rent in November 2020 and that the Landlord is still holding
the rent deposit.
Bearing in mind that the Landlord had knowledge




 
of the November 1, 2020 e-mail
when the L1 Application was filed, the inconsistent positions advanced
by the Landlord caused me to doubt the accuracy
of the Landlord’s records.
 
20.  Finally, neither the Landlord’s agent nor the Landlord cross-examined the Tenant on his
testimony to the effect that June 2020’s rent was paid in cash with money from
the
Tenant’s sister. In circumstances where the Landlord
was not in the habit of providing rent receipts, the Tenant’s
inability to provide such a receipt does not undermine his
testimony. In circumstances where the Tenant’s
sister testified that she arrived
in Canada in February 2020
with money, the Tenant’s sister’s inability to produce a receipt for a transfer
of $2,000.00 does not undermine her testimony.
 
21.  For all of the above reasons my finding is that the
Landlord did not prove on the balance of probabilities that the Tenant applied
one of the rent deposits to the rent for June 2020. As the remainder of the
evidence was essentially undisputed, this leads me to find that the Landlord
collected three deposits of $1,900.00 from the Tenant. One of the deposits was
applied to October 2020’s rent of $1,950.00, leaving a balance of $50.00. One of the deposits was applied to November 2020’s
rent of $1,950.00, leaving a balance of $50.00.
The Tenant paid nil rent for the period December 1, 2020 to March 1, 2021.
 
22.  The remaining deposit
of $1,900.00 is a last month rent’s
deposit and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord. Interest on the rent deposit is owing for the
period April 20, 2019 to November
22, 2020, the termination date specified on the Landlord’s N4 Notice of
Termination.
 
Tenant’s Issues
 
23.  Pursuant to section
82 of the Act the Tenant asserted
that the Landlord
engaged in harassment
contrary to section 23 of the Act, which provides:
 
23. A landlord shall
not harass, obstruct,
coerce, threaten or interfere with a tenant.
 
24.  Although the term harassment is not defined
in the Act, Board Interpretation Guideline 6, Tenant
Rights, summarizes the Board’s jurisprudence and notes that the Board often
applies the following definition: “engaging in a course of vexatious comment or
conduct that is known or ought reasonably to be known to be unwelcome.”
 
25.  In this case the parties
had vastly different perspectives on whether
the Landlord’s conduct
breached section 23 of the Act.
 
26.  In short summary, the Tenant’s position is that the
Landlord’s actions in attending the rental unit and communicating with him
repeatedly, interfering with the electricity in the rental unit and keying
his car constitutes harassment within the meaning of the Act. The
Landlord’s position was that the Tenant was harassing the Landlord by not
paying the rent, that the Landlord’s communications were culturally
appropriate, that Canada is a free country that permits free speech and that there
were no limits
on what the Landlord
could say to the Tenant provided that the speech itself was not illegal and
that the Landlord did not interfere with the electricity or key the Tenant’s
car.




 
Evidentiary Issue
 
27.  Before addressing the substance of the Tenant’s claim,
I should note that both parties introduced copies of text messages
and police reports
to support their
narrative of events. Some of the text messages are in
English, some are in Farsi/Persian and some are in a combination of both. The
police redacted personal information of the Landlord in reports obtained by the
Tenant and vice versa.
 
28.  I had no trouble reviewing the evidence provided in
English. The Tenant provided translations of text messages exchanged between
the parties. These messages were translated
by Arezou Cheri
and accompanied by a affidavit
to the effect that the translator
is “fluent in English and Persian/Farsi languages” and that the translations
provided are “a true and correct translation from Persian/Farsi into English”.
The Landlord objected to these translations because Arezou Cheri is not a
member of the Association of
Translators and Interpreters of
Ontario (ATIO). The Landlord introduced an “official” translation of some but not all of the messages
translated by the Tenant. The Landlord’s
translator is Valiallah Ebrahimi, who is certified by ATIO.
 
29.  I reject the Landlord’s submission to the effect
that Tenant’s translations are inadmissible or
entitled to less weight simply because the Tenant’s translator is not certified
by ATIO. There is no requirement that translations be certified. Additionally,
the Landlord did not provide a “certified” translation for each of the translations proffered by the Tenant,
which made it impossible to compare whether there were any meaningful differences. Although the Landlord’s
agent also argued that I should assume that the Tenant’s translator is a
friend of the Tenant’s because
the Tenant testified that he paid the translator but did not provide a receipt, I reject this submission because
the Tenant denied
a friendship with the
translator on cross-examination and because there was no evidence to support
the Landlord’s speculative inference.
 
30.  One issue that I do have with the translations
proffered by the Tenant is that they infrequently include commentary or notes of explanation. For example, the Tenant’s
translation of the November 21,
2020 text message has the Landlord saying: “Until you pay the rent, I will come
bug you every single day to get my brother’s rent”. However, the translator adds the following in brackets: “As she claims,
this property is her brother’s and she is his representative”. Likewise, the Tenant’s
translation of a November 23, 2020 message includes the following in brackets:
“referring to the Police presence the day
before due to my complaint for
her harassment”. The December 15, 2020 translation adds the following explanation to the word “oghdei”: “very
insulting word that indicates
that person is suffering from personality issues and mentally is challenged”.
That the
Tenant’s translator added commentary and notes of explanation calls into question
the accuracy of the translations.
 
31.  That being said, where I was able to compare the
competing translations – text messages exchanged between December 15, 2020 and
December 17, 2020 – the differences in translation do not reveal
any meaningful differences in the substance of the message conveyed. For example, in the Landlord’s translation of the December 15, 2020
text exchange, the Landlord calls the Tenant “nasty” and a “rascal”, questions
whether
the Tenant has “guts” and calls the Tenant’s
sister “faceless”. In the Tenant’s
translation




 
of the same message, the Landlord
calls the Tenant “filth” and calls the Tenant and his sister “worthless”. In the Landlord’s translation of the December 16, 2020 text exchange,
the Landlord calls the Tenant a “moft khor”, which is translated as “moocher”.
However, the Landlord’s translation of the December
17, 2020 text exchange adds punctuation not found in the original and translates
the same word “moft khor” as meaning “sponger”: “Pay my rent; you sponger!”
Further, at the hearing, the Landlord’s agent testified that “moft khor” is a
term that captures the concept of someone who wants to live on other people’s shoulders. In other words, the Landlord’s translation and in-hearing explanation of these messages confirms
that the Landlord is insulting the Tenant because he is behind in the rent.
 
32.  In circumstances where the Landlord did not provide
counter translations for each of the text exchanges discussed
below and where
the Landlord did not bring
to my attention any
particular objections to the contents of any of the Tenant’s text messages for
which no counter translation was provided, my view is that the Tenant’s translations
are the best evidence before me except where the Landlord has provided a
counter translation. That being said, I will ignore any commentary or notes of
explanation.
 
33.  As for the police reports, it appeared to me that both
parties sought to introduce police reports to prove that the other party
engaged in harassment. While the calling of the police is certainly not irrelevant, and while the police reports
are useful in understanding
what one party told to the police in and around the time the reports were
written, it is worth emphasizing that the reports themselves are hearsay and do
not in and of themselves prove that the conduct each party is complaining about
occurred as described in their complaint.
 
Evidence and Analysis
 
34.  The Tenant did not prove on the balance of probabilities that the Landlord
or an agent of the Landlord
keyed his car or interfered with his electricity for the following reasons.
 
35.  There was no direct evidence
that the Landlord
keyed the Tenant’s
car. Although the evidence clearly established that
there was a marked deterioration in the parties’ relationship, the existence of
this dispute was insufficient to prove on the balance of probabilities that the
Landlord damaged the Tenant’s car.
 
36.  With respect to the assertion that the Landlord interfered with the supply
of electricity to the Tenant’s unit, the Tenant admitted
that he did not directly observe the Landlord do
this. The Tenant’s witness
Mr. Mohammad Ghanbarian testified that he used to live in the
basement of the rental unit and that he observed the Landlord knock on the door
to the residential complex, go to the basement and cut the electricity to the
Tenant’s unit. That being said, Mr. Ghanbarian could provide specific details
of when this incident allegedly occurred apart from testifying
that it occurred in December 2020. In circumstances
where the Landlord denied interfering with the Tenant’s electricity and where
the Tenant’s witness could not accurately describe
when he allegedly observed the Landlord engaging in this conduct my conclusion is
that the Tenant did not prove this allegation on the balance of probabilities.




 
37.  The result is that neither
of the above-discussed incidents will factor in my analysis
of whether the Landlord’s conduct amounts to a breach of section 23 of
the Act.
 
38.  The Tenant did prove on the balance of probabilities
that the Landlord’s repeated attendances at
the rental unit and repeated communications to the Tenant
respecting the rent constitute a course of vexatious and bullying conduct
and comment that the Landlord knew or ought to have known was
unwelcome by the Tenant. This conduct constitutes a breach of section 23 of the
Act and the Tenant is entitled to a remedy.
 
39.  A short summary of the Tenant’s testimony was that
there were no difficulties between the parties for the first several years of
the tenancy, but that the Landlord started a campaign of harassment once the Tenant fell behind
in the rent. The Tenant testified that the
Landlord attended at the rental
unit and communicated with him about the rent nearly incessantly from November 20,
2020 onwards. The Tenant estimated that the Landlord attended the rental unit
twenty times and called him names when she did so. There are several reasons
why I find that the Tenant proved the allegation of harassment on the balance
of probabilities.
 
40.  First, the Tenant’s claim is amply supported by the
evidence provided by both parties. This includes messages the Landlord sent to
the Tenant, including her message of November
21, 2020 stating
that she will come bug the Tenant
every single day and her message of November 22, 2020 stating
that she will text the Tenant every day for her money. This will be discussed
in greater detail below.
 
41.  Second, a great
deal of the Landlord’s evidence
was of limited relevance to the
issue at hand. To the extent
that evidence about the unpaid water bill, the Landlord’s mother’s illness in Iran and the Landlord’s unpaid property taxes could provide
an explanation for why it was important for the Landlord
to receive the rent or for why the Landlord was
frustrated with the Tenant, this
evidence did not refute the Tenant’s evidence about the Landlord’s behaviour.
While evidence about properties the Tenant owns elsewhere could at best provide
an explanation for why the Landlord believed the Tenant could afford the rent,
this evidence also did not refute the Tenant’s evidence about the Landlord’s
behaviour. Bearing in mind that the Tenant is entitled to take roommates without
the Landlord’s permission, evidence
confirming that the Tenant’s sister
lived in the rental unit, which the Tenant admitted, was also
irrelevant.
 
42.  Third, the Landlord did not introduce expert evidence
on the issue of whether the Landlord’s communications to the Tenant were culturally appropriate. In the absence of such evidence, I cannot accept this
position.
 
43.  Fourth, although the Landlord attended the hearing and
testified, the Landlord testimony was first that she did not want to comment
and next that she did not accept what the Tenant was saying. Despite apparently
disagreeing with the Tenant’s evidence, the Landlord ultimately blamed the Tenant’s failure
to pay the rent for the “situation”, admitted that the attended the rental unit once to twice weekly
and admitted to sending the Tenant “lots” of text messages using “bad words”.
In other words, despite initially denying the
Tenant’s allegations the Landlord
in substance admitted
the conduct which the Tenant asserts amounts to harassment.




 
44.  The following is an example of the Landlord’s
communications to the Tenant. These communications clearly demonstrate that the Landlord
engaged in a course of vexatious
comment and conduct that the Landlord knew or ought to have known to be unwelcome,
not least because the Tenant told the Landlord the conduct was unwelcome.
 
45.  On November 21, 2020 the Landlord asked the Tenant to
pay the rent by text message. However, the Landlord
also indicated that she would come bug the Tenant
every day until he paid the rent and that
this was how it was going to be, or
worse than this, until the rent was paid. The Landlord
told the Tenant to stop being a freeloader and be a man.
 
46.  On November 22, 2020 the Landlord tells the Tenant
that he is responsible for the hospitalization of the Landlord’s husband,
explaining that the Landlord and her husband had an argument about the Tenant.
The Landlord describes
the Tenant as ignoble and as
a miscreant and tells the Tenant that he should not be calling himself a man. The
Landlord tells the Tenant that he does not deserve to have a family and that
this is why
the Tenant’s wife abandoned
him.
 
47.  Although the Tenant asked the Landlord to stop texting
him on November 22, 2020, the Landlord’s reply of the same day is that she will text the Tenant
every day for her money. She calls the Tenant a cheat, a crook and a loser
and asserts that anything that happens to her family is the Tenant’s
fault.
 
48.  On November 23, 2020 the Landlord writes that she
prays to god and wishes that the Tenant and his family will get some sort of
non-curable disease because the Tenant is not paying the rent. The Landlord
writes that her mother, who is in hospital, is also cursing the Tenant. The Landlord calls
the Tenant shameful, a freeloader and writes that the Tenant should give her the rent
and get the hell out of her house. The Landlord’s reply to the Tenant asking
her for a second time to stop texting him is for the Tenant to “stop not paying
the rent” and that she wants her rent as soon as possible.
 
49.  On November 24, 2020 the Landlord asks the Tenant
when she can come get the rent. She then writes that she respects
her husband as a real man and that she hopes the Tenant will keep his promise
to pay the rent on December 15, 2020 as a man.
 
50.  On December 12, 2020 the Tenant called the police to complain
about what he perceived
as harassment. The author notes
that the Landlord
was standing a few feet back from the
rental unit, that slightly raised voices were observed, but that there was no
loud yelling or physical gesticulating and no concerns regarding the potential
for an assault. The author reports the Landlord as stating that she wanted her
January rent and that rent was up to date for December.
 
51.  On December 14, 2020 the Landlord’s agent asserts that
the Tenant Is illegally renting the unit to persons not specified in the tenancy
agreement, asserts that the Tenant
wants to live out of the Landlord’s pocket and concludes: “Shame on
you.” As noted above, the Tenant was entitled to have a roommate.




 
52.  As noted above, the Landlord’s translation of the text messages
between December 15- 17, 2020 confirm that the Landlord
called the Tenant nasty, a rascal, a moocher and a sponger.
 
53.  On December 22, 2020 the Landlord writes
that the Tenant’s
sister is not her Tenant
and asks the Tenant to ask his sister to leave. The Landlord writes that
the Tenant’s sister is using the property
illegally and that she has hired a private investigator. As noted above, the
Tenant was entitled to have a roommate.
 
54.  On December 25, 2020 the Landlord asks if the rent is ready and states that she is on the way to pick up the rent. The Landlord
calls the Tenant a “moft khor” (i.e. moocher or sponger) and tells the Tenant
to ask his sister to leave the Landlord’s home. As noted above, the Tenant was
entitled to have a roommate.
 
55.  On December 31, 2020 the Landlord’s agent reminds the
Tenant that the rent is due the next day. However,
several hours later,
the Landlord’s agent asks the Tenant how it feels to live in other people’s property
for free and calls the Tenant a “moft khor” (i.e. moocher or sponger).
 
56.  On February 17, 2021 the Landlord’s agent asserts that the Tenant
has illegal occupants in the rental unit. As noted
above, the Tenant is entitled to have a roommate.
 
57.  A On February
25, 2021 the Landlord calls
the Tenant a piece of garbage without
shame, queries what kind of animal the Tenant is, asserts that the Tenant and his sister must cough up every
single penny they have received from the government and concludes by calling
the Tenant a piece of shit, a fraud, a cheater, a loser and a beggar.
 
58.  In my view, the Tenant’s testimony to the effect that
the Landlord harassed him by frequently contacting him and attending the rental
unit was entirely consistent with the Landlord’s stated intention to do so. On
November 21, 2020 the Landlord stated she would come bug the Tenant every day until he paid the rent, or worse. On
November 22, 2020 the Landlord
stated she would
text the Tenant
every day for her money.
Despite the Tenant’s protest,
the Landlord continued to contact the Tenant and attend the unit frequently
until the end of February 2021.
 
59.  The Tenant’s testimony was also consistent with the
police reports filed by both parties. Ignoring the question of whether the conduct
complained of by the parties occurred as described to the police, the November
23, 2020 police report confirms that the author of the report was able to
confirm that the Tenant received 11 text messages from the Landlord since
November 21, 2020, plus 11 texts on WhatsApp and 5 phone calls. The December
28, 2020 police report confirms that the Landlord told police that she will
continue to go to the rental unit once a week until she receives her rent
money. A December 29, 2020 police report confirms that the Landlord reported
that she attended the rental unit to collect rent money and was turned away. A
February 23, 2021 police report filed by the Landlord confirms that the
Landlord attended the rental unit. Even the evidence of the Landlord’s witness, Ms. Mahrafza
Gholipouri, confirmed that the Landlord attended the rental unit in
January 2021 and that the Tenant told the Landlord that her attendance was
unwelcome.




 
60.  The Landlord’s agent argued that Canada is a free
country and that the Landlord was entitled to speak
to the Tenant any way she pleased
provided her speech
was not illegal. This position is inconsistent
with the Act, which expressly forbids harassment, and the Board’s
jurisprudence, which generally upholds the principle that Landlord’s are in
business and expected to behave in a professional manner. (See, for example:
TET- 99706-19 (Re), 2020 CanLII 61283 (ON LTB) at para. 31; TET-89788-18 (Re), 2018 CanLII 113779 (ON LTB) at
para. 48; TEL-73754-16 (Re), 2016 CanLII 88390 (ON LTB)
at paras. 30-31; TST-51071-14 (Re), 2014 CanLII
71685 (ON LTB) at para.
62). Although it was perfectly
understandable for the Landlord to be upset about the Tenant’s non- payment of
the rent, this upset can never justify the campaign of harassment the Landlord
embarked upon. It goes without saying that a reasonable landlord does not act
in this manner. Personal, ad hominem remarks are not professional and a
reasonable landlord ought to know they will be unwelcome. The appropriate
course was to use the Board’s process by issuing an N4 and subsequently filing
an L1 Application.
 
61.  In my view, a reasonable abatement for the Landlord’s
campaign of harassment is 30% from November 21, 2020 to March 1, 2021. I reach this conclusion because
the Landlord both harassed
the Tenant in her communications and by attending the unit personally, making the harassment impossible to ignore. The personal
nature and cruelty
of some of the Landlord’s communications are
especially abhorrent, including the Landlord’s questioning of the Tenant’s
gender and the Landlord’s assertion about the Tenant’s entitlement to have a
family. The total abatement awarded will be $1,923.29, calculated as follows:
$1950.00 per month x 12 months / 365 days x 30% x 100 days.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TNL-29867-20 issued on February
22, 2021 is cancelled
and replaced with the
following.
 
2.     The tenancy is terminated as of March
1, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$1,983.05*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to March 1, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit and less the rent
abatement the Landlord
owes the Tenant.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before March 1, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 2, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
