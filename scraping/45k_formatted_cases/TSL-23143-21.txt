Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-23143-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


211, 7 CRESCENT PLACE TORONTO ON M4C5L7


 




Between:


Pinedale Properties Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Alden
Knight Jamie Knight


Tenants



 
 
 
Pinedale Properties Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Jamie Knight and Alden Knight (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 27, 2021.
The Landlord’s Legal Representative, Gail Kukor Lang,
and one of the Tenants,
Jamie Knight, attended
the hearing.
 
 
The Tenant sought an adjournment to seek counsel. To date, no
counsel had been retained although the Notice of Hearing was mailed by the
Board on August 20, 2021. The Tenant
was unable to explain why no counsel was retained and provided vague testimony
about having talked to counsel in an effort
to retain one just a few days before. The Tenant was informed of the
availability of using duty counsel on the day of the hearing but declined. Adjourning the hearing would have been prejudicial to the Landlord
in the face or accruing arrears, the availability of duty
counsel that the Tenant declined and given that the Tenant took no steps to
retain counsel to date. Upon
communicating this to the Tenant, the tenant became disruptive and the matter
had to be stood down several times. Part way through proceeding with the matter,
the Tenant elected to hang up the phone and refused
to participate in the proceeding. Under the circumstances, I found that
proceeding with the hearing was just, fair and expeditious.




File Number: TSL-23143-21
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required
to pay for the period from April 1, 2020 to October 31,
2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 19, 2021.
2.    
The Tenants are in
possession of the rental
unit.
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,649.00.
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,649.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from March 1, 2021 to
July 19, 2021.
6.    
The Tenants
paid $1,149.00 after
the application was filed.
7.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the parties and whether
the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 16, 2022.
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$19,294.95*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 5, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $54.21 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 6, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
5.     If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing*
on or before January 16,
2022, the Tenants will start
to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at 2.00% annually
on the balance outstanding.
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January
17, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 17, 2022.




File Number: TSL-23143-21
 
 
8.    
If, on
or before January 16, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $22,427.82** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
9.    
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if
they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after January 17, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
