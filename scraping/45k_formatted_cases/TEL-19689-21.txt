Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19689-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1707, 50 BRIAN
HARRISON WAY TORONTO ON
  M1P5J4


 




Between:


Wen C. Lin


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Harry, Haoran Zhang Tianzang Liao


Tenants



 
 
 
Wen C. Lin (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Harry,
Haoran Zhang and Tianzang Liao (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did
not pay the rent that the Tenants owe. The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque
charges and related administration charges.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
5, 2022. Only the Landlord
attended the hearing. As of
2:32 p.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from November 1, 2020 to January
31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 22, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $2,150.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Landlord incurred
charges of $180.00
for cheques tendered
by or on behalf of the Tenants, which were returned NSF and
$120.00 for related administration charges.
 
6.    
The Tenants paid $4,000.00
after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the




File Number: TEL-19689-21
 
Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 6, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$12,660.75*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 26, 2022 and the total charges related to
NSF cheques tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenants.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $70.68 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 27, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or
before February 6, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 7,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 6, 2022, then starting
February 7, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 7, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$13,136.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$15,286.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 6, 2022**.
If the Tenants
do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 7, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
