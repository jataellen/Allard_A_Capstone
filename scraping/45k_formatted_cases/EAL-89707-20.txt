Ryan Roettger


Tenant



 
 
Osgoode Properties (the 'Landlord') applied for an order requiring Ryan Roettger (the 'Tenant')
who was employed as a superintendent to pay compensation for the money
the Tenant should have paid to the Landlord, because
they remained at the superintendent’s premises after the Tenant’s employment
had ended. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on June 30, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord’s Legal
Representative, Anne Skelly, attended the hearing. As of 11 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing,
although properly served with notice
of this hearing by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant was still in possession of the rental
unit as of the date the application was filed.
 
2.     The monthly rent for the rental unit where the Tenant resided
is $1,440.00.
 
3.     The Tenant was terminated from his position as
Superintendent by the Landlord on February 20, 2020. The Tenant
has not vacated
the superintendent's premises
and more than one week has
passed since their employment was terminated
 
4.     Section 93 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006,
S.O., 2006, c.17, (the “Act”)
states:
 
93(1) If a
landlord has entered into a tenancy agreement with respect to a
superintendent’s premises, unless
otherwise agreed, the tenancy terminates on the day on which
the employment of the tenant is terminated.




 
(2)  A tenant shall vacate a superintendent’s premises
within one week after his or
her tenancy is terminated.
(3)  A
landlord shall not charge a tenant rent or compensation or receive rent or
compensation from a tenant with respect to the one-week period mentioned in
subsection (2).
 
 
5.     Section 94 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006,
S.O., 2006, c.17, (the “Act”)
states:
“The landlord may apply to the
Board for an order terminating the tenancy of a tenant of superintendent’s premises
and evicting the tenant
if the tenant does not vacate the rental
unit within one week of the termination of his or her employment.”
 
6.     Based on the totality of the uncontested evidence
presented I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Tenant was employed by the Landlord as a
superintendent and that his unit was
the “superintendent’s premises”. Pursuant to subsection 93(2) of the Act, a tenant shall vacate a superintendent’s premises
within one week after his or her tenancy is terminated. As at the date of the
hearing, the Tenant had vacated the unit
on March 31, 2020.
 
7.     On the balance
of probabilities, I am persuaded
that the tenancy
should have been terminated on February 27, 2020, because the Tenants’
employment as superintendent ended on
February 20, 2020.
 
8.    I find the Tenant is responsible to pay the Landlord daily compensation from February 20, 2020 (7 days after terminated as superintendent) up to and including
March 31, 2020, the date the Tenant gave the Landlord vacant possession.
The amount owed would be offset by rent paid to the Landlord during the
time period
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
February 27, 2020, 7 days after the
Tenant’s employment was terminated.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$1,534.70, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from February 28,
2020 to March 31, 2020, the day that the Tenant vacated the unit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does
not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February
25, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 26, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
