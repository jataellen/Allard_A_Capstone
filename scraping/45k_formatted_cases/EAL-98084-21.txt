Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-98084-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


307, 339 AMHERST DRIVE KINGSTON ON K7N1V8


 




Between:


Torbill Holdings Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Alexis Sager


Tenant



 
 
 
Torbill Holdings Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Alexis Sager (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 18, 2022. Only
the Landlord's employee, Tania Wannamaker attended the hearing. As of 10:35 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the total
rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from April 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective April 28, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     
As of January 1, 2022, the monthly rent for the unit is $1,113.20.
 
4.     
The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,100.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period from December
2, 2020 to January 1, 2022.
 
7.     
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact
of COVID-19 on the parties and
whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment




 
agreement with the Tenant
and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 13, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $5,706.70*, which represents the
amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
2, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$36.60 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 3, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 13, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 14, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 13, 2022, then starting February
14, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 14, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before February 13,
2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $8,012.40** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated; and
the Tenant could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 14, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
