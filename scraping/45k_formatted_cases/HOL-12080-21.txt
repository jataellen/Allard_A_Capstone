Amit Sahi and Mandeep
Sahi (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Amanda - Lee Desousa (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 11, 2022.
Only one of the Landlords, Mandeep Sahi, attended the
hearing. As of 11:20 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
March 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective May 10,
2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
January 7, 2022. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date the
application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $900.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $900.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still being held by the Landlords.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period from December
22, 2020 to May 10, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of January
7, 2022, the date the Tenant returned
vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlords.




File Number: HOL-12080-21
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $8,356.32*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 7, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlords
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount
owing* on or before January
30, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 31, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January
19, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
