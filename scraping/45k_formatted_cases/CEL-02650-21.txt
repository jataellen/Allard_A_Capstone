Randolph Cooper (the 'Landlord') applied

was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.

to pay for the period
from July 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective July 16, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on
September 11, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the

monthly rent was $850.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
is not holding a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.

is terminated as of September 11, 2021, the date the Tenant returned vacant possession of the rental
unit to the Landlord.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$2,040.27*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to September 11, 2021.

the application.

If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
