Review Order
 
Minto Properties Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Melissa Heroux (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved
by order SWL-46248-20 issued on November
23, 2021.
 
On November 29, 2021, the Board initiated a review of the order.
The order issued on November 23, 2021 required the Tenant to make various
payments on various
dates between April
12, 2021 to October 1, 2021,
failing which the Landlord was permitted to file an application to terminate
that tenancy pursuant to section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’) (an L4 application). Because of the Board’s delay in issuing the
order it may have frustrated the Landlord’s remedial opportunity under section
78.
 
On November 29, 2021,
the Board issued interim order SWL-46248-20-RV-IN directing
the matter to a review hearing for determination.
 
The request was heard by way of video
conference on February
3, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, John
Edlund attended the hearing. As of 2:04 pm, the Tenant was not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served notice of this hearing by
the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
Board Initiated Review
 
1.       
The hearing of the Landlord’s L1
application was held on April 8, 2021. On
consent of the parties, the Tenant was granted relief from eviction by way of a
payment plan. The order required the
Tenant to make various payments on various dates between April 12, 2021 to October 1, 2021, failing
which the Landlord
was permitted to file an application to




 
terminate that tenancy pursuant
to section 78 of the Act. The Landlord had to apply for the eviction
pursuant to section
78 of the Act within
30 days of the Tenant
breaching one of the specified
payments. Because the Board
issued the order more than 30 days after
the final payment date expired, the Landlord was denied the opportunity to
apply for eviction when the Tenant breached the specified payments set out in
the order.
 
2.       
On a balance of probabilities, I
am satisfied that a serious error occurred in the Board’s proceedings because
of the delay in issuing the order. The
delay resulted in the Landlord’s inability to apply to the Board to terminate
the tenancy when the Tenant breached one or more of the payments
set out in the order that were subject to section 78 of the Act.
 
3.       
The review is granted.
 
New Hearing
of the Landlord’s L1 Application
 
4.       
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the
Tenant was required to pay for the period from
May 1, 2020 to February
28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective June 25,
2020.
 
5.       
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
6.       
As of February 1, 2022, the new lawful
monthly rent is $1,256.63.
 
7.       
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,215.00 from the Tenant and
this deposit is still being held by
the Landlord.
 
8.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2020 to June 25, 2020.
 
9.       
The Tenant paid $14,521.01 after the application was filed.
 
10.   
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act'), and whether the Landlord
attempted to negotiate repayment of the arrears
of rent due to the impact of COVID-19, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The review is granted.
 
2.       
Order SWL-46248-20 issued on November 23, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the
following:
 
3.       
Unless the Tenant voids the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.




 
4.       
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $8,463.91*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
17, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
5.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$40.82 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 18, 2022 to
the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
6.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
9.       
If, on or before February 28,
2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $9,974.86** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
10.    The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this
order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after March 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make
this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
