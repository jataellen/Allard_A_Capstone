Barrie Housing (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Paul Barnes (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 24, 2022. The Landlord’s Agents, Melissa Scott and Angeleka Daley,
and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective October 3, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent is $961.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant paid all arrears for the period ending January
31, 2022 after the application was filed.

outstanding is the Landlord's cost of filing the application. As a result, the order will be limited to costs
only and not eviction.
