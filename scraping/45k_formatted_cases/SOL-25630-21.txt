#3
BACK, 30 SIXTH
STREET WELLAND ON L3B5A6

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jeffery Vanderloos


Tenant



 
 
 
2506790 Ontario
Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Jeffery Vanderloos (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 15, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, John McNall,
attended the hearing. As of 10:53 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period
from September 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective October 23, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly rent is
$809.60.
 
4.     The
Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $800.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period from May 8, 2019 to
October 23, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $2,350.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the parties and whether
the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




File Number: SOL-25630-21
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 7, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $1,497.32*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
24, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $26.30
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 25, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before March 7, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 8, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 7, 2022, then starting
March 8, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 8, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$2,645.60 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022,
or
ii)             
$3,455.20 if the payment
is made on or
before March 7, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph
and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after March
8, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
