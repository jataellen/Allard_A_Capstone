In the matter
of:


34, 220 GORDON
STREET GUELPH ON N1G1K3


 




Between:


Timbri Property
  Management


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Ali Zaki


Tenant



 
 
 
Timbri Property
Management (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ali Zaki (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by teleconference on December 13, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s representative J. Scanlon,
the Landlord’s legal representative K. Houchen, and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
It is determined
that:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
April 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination.
 
2.    
At the hearing the
Tenant disputed the amount of arrears claimed by the Landlord. However, the
Landlord had filed a ledger and the Tenant gave no evidence that would modify or contradict the information in the Landlord’s ledger. The ledger
indicates that the Tenant owes $10,594.40 in arrears to
December 31, 2021.
 
3.    
Based on the Landlord’s uncontested evidence, I find, on a balance
of probabilities, that the Tenant owes $10,594.40 in
arrears to December 31, 2021.
 
4.     At the hearing
the Landlord’s legal representative waived
the Landlord’s claim to $170.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.    
This matter was a de
novo hearing held pursuant to an order of the Divisional Court. The
original hearing was held on December 4, 2020. The Tenant did not attend.
An order was




 
issued on
December 29, 2020. The Tenant appealed that order and in a decision released on
October 1, 2021, the Court set aside the Board order dated December 29, 2020
and remitted the application to a new hearing. The Court also ordered that the
Landlord pay costs to the Tenant in the amount of $1,500.00. The parties agree that the Landlord has not paid these costs to
the Tenant.
 
6.     Deducting
the costs ordered
by the Divisional court, the total amount owed by the Tenant is $9,094.40.
 
7.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’)), including the impact of COVID-19
on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find
that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the
conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of
the Act.
 
8.    
The Tenant has lived in
the unit for approximately 14 years. He has disabilities and receives a very
limited income from social assistance. The Tenant testified that he had
additional transportation costs for his medical appointments due to the
pandemic. His medical travel costs are ordinarily paid for by social assistance
but they only compensate for the least expensive form of travel which is a
public bus. Understandably the Tenant is afraid to travel from Guelph to Toronto and back on the bus during the pandemic. Further, the Tenant could not pay rent for
some of the months in arrears because of extraordinary costs associated with
the Divisional Court proceedings. The Tenant incurred costs for a camera and a
printer because he needed to make/copy and electronically file documents for
the appeal. These expenditures were more than would be incurred by a legal
representative with experience in court but are understandable in the Tenant’s
situation. The Tenant testified that the costs he incurred
for the lawyer
who assisted him were
more than the $1,500.00 awarded by the Court. This makes sense, even if
the lawyer did not produce or file the documents for the appeal.
 
9.    
The Landlord
is a property management company.
The owner of the building
is a corporation with
properties in several Ontario cities/towns.
 
10.  Considering all of the circumstances above,
I find that it would not be unfair to deny eviction on condition that the Tenant pay the arrears and the monthly
rent that comes
due on a payment plan that commences on January 1, 2022. I am aware that
it will take approximately 5 years for the Tenant to pay off the arrears on
this plan.
 
11.  At the hearing
I told the parties my decision and I warned
the Tenant that this order may
not be released by January 1, 2022 but that his first arrears payment and his
rent for January 2022 are still due by that date and that if the Tenant
breaches either of these payments he will face the same consequence as if the
order had been issued before January 1, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant
shall pay the Landlord
$9,094.40 in arrears of rent to December
31, 2021.




 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord the amount set out in paragraph 1 as follows: commencing January 1, 2022, on or before the first day of
each month the Tenant shall pay $150.00 to the Landlord
towards the arrears.
These payments will continue until the
arrears are paid in full.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
new rent on time and in full as it comes due and owing until the arrears are paid
in full.
 
4.    
If the Tenant fails to
make any one of the payments in accordance with this order, the outstanding
balance of any arrears to be paid by the Tenant to the Landlord pursuant to
paragraph 1 of this order shall become immediately due and owing and the
Landlord may, without notice to
the Tenant, apply to the Board pursuant
to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and
evicting the Tenant and requiring that the Tenant pay any new arrears, NSF fees
and related charges that became owing after December 31, 2021.
