Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006

In the matter
of:


LOWER UNIT,
97A WELLINGTON STREET
E BARRIE ON L4M2C6


 




Between:


Jie
  Fu


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Josh Wolf Justin
  Wolf


Tenants



 
 
 
Jie Fu (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Josh Wolf and Justin Wolf (the 'Tenants') because they,
another occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the
residential complex have wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the
premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenants to
compensate the Landlord for the damage; because they, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another
tenant; and because
they have been persistently late in paying their
rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 15, 2021. Only the Landlord
attended the hearing. The Tenants were not present or represented
although properly served with the notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on September 30, 2021. The issue of whether this tenancy should be terminated is
therefore moot.
 
2.     The only issue for the Board to determine in this
application is whether the Tenants wilfully or negligently caused undue damage
to the rental unit and if so, what is the reasonable cost of repairing
or replacing damaged
property the Tenants
should pay to the Landlord.
 
3.    
Section 89 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, S.O. 2006, c.17 (‘Act’,) states the
following:
A landlord may apply to the
Board for an order requiring a tenant to pay reasonable costs that the landlord
has incurred or will incur for the repair of or, where repairing is




 
not reasonable, the replacement
of damaged property, if the tenant, another occupant of the rental
unit or a person whom the tenant
permits in the residential
complex wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to the rental unit or the
residential complex and the tenant is in possession of the rental unit.
4.    
The Landlord alleged that the Tenants
caused the following undue damages to the rental unit or residential complex:
 
a.   
Broken door to the laundry
room;
b.   
Damaged carpets;
c.   
Broken glass in the entry door;
d.   
At least 10 large
4-5-inch holes in drywall throughout the unit; and
e.   
Broken bathroom door.
5.    
The Landlord claimed $1,500.00
in costs to repair or replace
and repair the damaged items in
the rental unit.
 
6.     While the Landlord
did not provide
any photographs or invoices in support of his claims,
I found his testimony to be credible and reliable. He was consistent and
forthcoming and provided detailed answers when questioned. Based on his
uncontested testimony I find that it is more likely than not that the Tenants
willfully or negligently caused the damage as listed above and that this damage
is undue.
 
7.     The Landlord testified
about the anticipated costs of repairs
based on his experience and on his conversations with repairmen.
On the uncontested evidence before the Board, I find that the Landlord has
incurred costs and will incur future costs of at least $1,500.00 to repair the
damage to the rental unit.
 
8.     The Landlord has incurred the cost of $186.00 for filing
the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$1,500.00, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage and/or
replacing the damaged property.
 
2.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
3.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before January 28, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 29, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
