In the matter
of:


UPPER, 461 EDISON
AVENUE S PETERBOROUGH ON
  K9J4G4


 




Between:


Kelly Mahoney


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Brittney Beaumont


Tenant



 
 
 
Kelly Mahoney
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Brittney Beaumont (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires possession of
the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 11, 2022.
 
The Landlord,
Kelly Mahoney, and the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Crystal Francey,
attended the hearing. As of 11:30
a.m., the Tenant was not present nor represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     For the reasons that follow, I find that the Landlord,
in good faith, requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of
residential occupation. The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant will be
terminated as of February 13, 2022.
 
2.     The Landlord and Tenant entered into a tenancy
agreement in September 2019 with a monthly rent of $1200.00. A deposit for last
month’s rent was received on September 1, 2019.
 
3.     On August 31, 2021, the Landlord served the Tenant
with an N12 Notice of Termination (‘N12 notice’). The N12 notice stated that
the Landlord required the rental unit for residential occupation for her child.
The N12 notice sought possession of the rental unit for October 31, 2021.




 
The Landlord’s “good faith”
intention
 
4.    
The N12 notice was served pursuant
to section 48 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, S.O. 2006, c.17 (the
Act). The issue to be determined by
the Board is whether the Landlords have satisfied the “good faith” requirement
set out in subsection 48(1):
 
A landlord
may, by notice, terminate a tenancy if the landlord in good faith requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation for a period of at least one
year by,
 
(a)  
the landlord;
 
5.     The onus is on the Landlord to establish that the
Landlord, in good faith, has a genuine intention to occupy the premises. In Feeney v. Noble, 1994 CanLII 10538 (ON
SC), the Court held that the test of good faith is genuine intention to occupy
the premises and not the reasonableness of the Landlord’s proposal.
 
6.    
In Salter v. Beljinac, 2001 CanLII
40231, the Divisional Court reaffirmed the decision in Feeney, noting that the
Landlord’s motives are ‘largely irrelevant’. In Fava v. Harrison, 2014 ONSC 3352 (Div. Ct.) the Court held that while the motives
of the landlord are, per Salter, “largely irrelevant”, the
Board can consider the conduct and motives of the Landlord to draw inferences as to whether
the Landlord desires,
in good faith,
to occupy the property.
 
7.     The Landlord submitted a Declaration signed by her
daughter, Alana Mahoney, which stated that, in good faith, she requires the
rental unit for her own personal use for a period
of at least one year.
 
8.     The Landlord, in her uncontested testimony, stated
that her daughter is currently attending Trent University in Peterborough and
requires a place to reside while she continues her studies. She further testified that because the
Tenant did not vacate the rental unit by October 31, 2022, her daughter has
been staying with friends and “couch surfing”.
This living arrangement has been very disruptive to her daughter’s
university studies and has caused her undue stress.
 
9.    
I have considered
all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenant did
not attend the hearing, and thus I did not have the opportunity to hear any
evidence or submission from them relevant to my consideration under s. 83.
Compensation
 
10.  Section 48.1 of the Act requires a landlord seeking a
“personal use” eviction to provide compensation to their tenant
in an amount equal to one month’s
rent. Section 55.1 of the Act requires that the compensation be
paid by the landlord’s proposed termination date.




 
11.  The Landlord testified that the Tenant is in arrears
of rent and was served an N4 Notice of
Termination on October 5, 2021. She
further testified that it was clearly
communicated to the Tenant that the rent arrears for October were waived and
served as the required compensation. I
accept the Landlord’s undisputed evidence on this point.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated, as of February 13, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before February 13, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,252.53, which
represents compensation for the use of the unit from November 1, 2021 to
February 2, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $39.45 per day for
compensation for the use of the unit
from February 3, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing on or before February 13, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 14, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit
is not vacated on or before February 13, 2022, then starting February 14, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord on or after February 14, 2022.
