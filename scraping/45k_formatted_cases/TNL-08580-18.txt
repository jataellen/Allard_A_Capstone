            Order under Section 69
 
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-08580-18
 



 


 


 



 
RMP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict SK and GK (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay
the rent that the Tenants owe.  The Landlord also applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants because they have been persistently
late in paying their rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Newmarket on November
19, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord’s representative
MZ, attended the hearing.
 
 Determinations:
 
1.      The Tenants did not attend the hearing.  I was
satisfied that the Tenants had received notice of the hearing, so I proceeded
to hear the matter uncontested.
 
2.     
The Tenants have
persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
3.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent they were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2018 to
November 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination.
 
4.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,735.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
 
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2018 to December 12,
2018.
 
6.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.  The Tenants have
persistently failed to pay the rent on time for a full year, and it is
prejudicial to the Landlord to have the rent paid late every single month.
It is ordered that:
L1 application
 
1.     
Unless the Tenants void the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before January
2, 2019.
 
2.     
As of the date of this
order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the Landlord is
entitled to by $1,768.82*.
 
3.     
However, the Landlord is
authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the Landlord owes
the Tenants:
$58.40 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting December 13,
2018 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit, and
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     
The Landlord or the Tenants
shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
 
5.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 2, 2019, then starting January 3, 2019, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 3, 2019.
 
7.     
If the Tenants wish to void
this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust:
i)        $1,962.20 if the payment is made on or before December 31, 2018, or
ii)       $3,738.60 if the payment is made on or before January 2, 2019**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after January 3,
2019 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
 
 
.L2 application
9.     
If the Tenants void the
eviction order pursuant to paragraphs 7 or 8 of the order, then for the
12-month period commencing on February 1, 2019, and ending on January 1, 2020,
the Tenants shall pay the rent on or before the first day of each of those
months, respectively.
 
10.  
Section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 applies to paragraph9 of this order. If the Tenants
fail to make any payment, the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenants,
apply to the Board for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants.
The Landlord must make this application no later than 30 days after the Tenant
fails to make a payment.
