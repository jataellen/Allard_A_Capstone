Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19101-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


BASEMENT, 11 NAPIERMEWS DRIVE AJAX ON L1T0E1


 




Between:


Eric Verbalovas Shahrzad Verbalovas


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Ryan Roszak


Tenant



 
 
 
Eric Verbalovas and Shahrzad
Verbalovas (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ryan Roszak (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's
rent.
 
This application was heard in
Passcode: 956 0593 7653# on January 18, 2022.
Only the Landlords attended the hearing. The Tenant had signed in before the hearings began at 9:00am and met with Duty Counsel. The Tenant left the hearings
and did not return when this matter
was heard at 2:04pm.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has persistently failed
to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
2.    
The Landlords have attempted
to work with the Tenant
entering into agreements that the Tenant has
not complied with. The late payments
have been more consistent and frequent over time.
 
3.     The Landlords requested
that the Board delay the termination date to provide
the Tenant until February 24,
2022 to make arrangements to vacate the rental unit.
 
4.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until February 24, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated, as of February
24. The Tenant must move out
of the rental unit on or before February 24, 2022.




File Number: TEL-19101-21
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlords the full amount
owing on or before February
24, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 25, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 24, 2022,
then starting February
25, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
5.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after February 7, 2022.
