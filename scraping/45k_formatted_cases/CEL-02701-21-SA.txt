and


 




 


Alistair
Riddoch


Tenant



 
 
 
Mario Lampert
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Alistair Riddoch (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant
owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on July
26, 2021 with respect to application CEL-99297-21.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved
by order CEL-02701-21, issued on September
24, 2021. The Tenant filed a
motion to set aside order CEL-02701-21.
 
This motion was heard by video conference on December 21, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s legal representative, E. Bregu, and the Tenant attended the hearing. The Tenant
spoke to Tenant Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord
alleged that the Tenant had failed to pay the full rent for September, 2021, on or before the first day of that month, and thereby
breached order CEL-99297-21, issued on July 26, 2021. The Tenant admits that he breached the order.
 
2.    
The Tenant said that he
agreed, at the hearing held on July 12, 2021, to pay $600.00 towards the arrears of $3,986.00 each month because
his daughter and her boyfriend were supposed to live with him
and contribute $600.00 towards the rent. He said that shortly after the hearing, they broke
up, and they both moved out.
 
3.    
The Tenant said that he go fired in September, 2021, and was therefore unable to pay the rent in full that month.
 
4.    
The Tenant
said that he did not pay the rent on time for October, 2021,
because although he was hired
at a company on a temporary basis in September, 2021, he did not receive a
paycheque in time to pay the rent. He
said that he paid three months rent in




 
November, 2021,
in order to catch up on rent payments. He said that he paid two months worth of rent in December, 2021.
 
5.    
The Tenant
said that he is currently
working full time, and he has opportunities to carry out extra shifts,
for a total of about $2,500-2,700.00 per month. He said that he has no
other major expenses. However, he
proposed that he can continue to make arrears payments of no greater than
$600.00 per month.
 
6.    
The Tenant
said that he has lived in the rental unit for over 5 years,
and he can now walk to work. He said that he has opportunities where he is currently working
to get better employment, earning more.
 
7.    
The Tenant said that he has attempted to get help from Simcoe housing retention, but they will not help unless he has an eviction order.
 
8.    
The Tenant submits that he would be homeless
if evicted, and that would threaten his ability to continue to work. He said that he is able to continue with
a payment plan of
$600.00 per month towards
the arrears.
 
9.    
The Landlord submits
that the Tenant agreed to a payment plan in July, 2021, and the Landlord
accommodated the Tenant’s own proposal. However,
they submit that the Tenant breached after only two payments, and the Tenant
did not inform the Landlord about his financial
situation. The Landlord
submits that it is prejudicial to the Landlord
for the tenancy to continue.
 
10.   It is true that
the Tenant breached the payment plan that he himself proposed, a number of
times. He has also provided no
documentation to the Board or the Landlord about his employment status or
income. However, I find that the
Tenant’s payment history of the last two months
supports his testimony that he is currently employed, and that he, in good faith, is trying to reimburse the
Landlord for the missed rent payments in order to restore his tenancy to good
standing.
 
11.  The Tenant said that he would like to
continue the tenancy, and he wants to pay the arrears owed. He has also proposed a reasonable and
realistic payment plan based on his current, and anticipated income.
He is no longer counting
on third parties to help him pay the rent or arrears.
 
12.  Having considered all the circumstances
above in accordance with subsection 78(11) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’), I find that it would not be unfair to give the
Tenant another chance to maintain his tenancy and pay back the arrears he still
owes to the Landlord. He now owes
$2,786.00 in arrears and costs to the Landlord.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order CEL-02701-21, issued on September 24, 2021, is set aside.




 
2.    
The Landlord's application under section
78 of the Act is dismissed.
 
3.    
Order CEL-99297-21, issued on July 26, 2021, is cancelled and replaced by the following order.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall pay the Landlord $2,7860.00 arrears and costs as follows:
 
(a)   Commencing February, 2022, and continuing each month up to and including
May, 2022, $600.00 on or before the 15th day of each of those months, respectively,
(b)  
The balance
of $386.00 on or before
June 15, 2022.
 
5.    
Commencing January,
2022, and continuing each month, up to, and including, June, 2022, the Tenant shall
pay the full monthly rent no later
than the first day of each of those
months, respectively.
 
6.    
Section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 applies to this order.
If the Tenant fails to make any payment,
the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to the Board
for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord must
make this application no later than 30 days after the Tenant fails to make a
payment.
