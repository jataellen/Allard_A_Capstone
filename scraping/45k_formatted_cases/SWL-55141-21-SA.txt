Order under Section

Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55141-21-SA
 
 



In the matter
of:


701A, 205 OXFORD
STREET EAST LONDON ON
  N6A5G6


 




Between:


Centurion Property Associates Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Tarek Wahid


Tenant



 
 
 
Centurion
Property Associates Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Tarek Wahid (the
'Tenant') and for an order
to have the Tenant pay the
rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on July 15, 2021 with respect to
application SWL-48971-21.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved
by order SWL-55141-21 issued on October
14, 2021 (the ‘Order’). The
Tenant filed a motion to set aside the Order.
 
This motion was heard in Passcode: 910 9539 0063# on December 6,
2021. The Landlord’s representative, R. Rose, and the Tenant attended the hearing.
Determinations:
1.    
The Tenant did not dispute the Landlord’s allegation that the Tenant had failed to make a
payment of $2,461.00 by August 31, 2021, which was a condition of the Order. The
Tenant also did not contest the Landlord’s allegation that, except for one payment
of
$202.00, no rent had been paid for the months
of October, November and December 2021.
 
2.    
The parties
agreed that the $2,461.00 payment
due on August 31, 2021 was made on
September 21, 2021.
 
3.    
The Tenant
testified that the August 31st payment was late as it was sourced from the
Housing Stability Bank and arrived late through no fault of the Tenant.
 
4.    
The Tenant testified that he has had no other income for the past few months but that he was returning to work in January 2022. He has been on sick leave for a year. He will be returning to work on a part time basis as he will be a full time student in the new year. As
a student he will be receiving funds in the amount of roughly $12,000.00 from
OSAP in




 
January 2022. These funds will allow
him to pay the current arrears
in full by the end of
January 2022.
 
5.    
The Tenant requested that the Order be set aside and that he be allowed
to the end of January 2022 to
bring rent current and so avoid eviction.
 
6.    
The Landlord’s
representative indicated that the Tenant had a history of rental arrears. He
had fallen into arrears immediately on the commencement of his tenancy and the
Landlord is concerned that if the order
is set aside without some recourse to the Landlord the issue will be ongoing.
 
7.    
I find that it would not be unfair to
set aside the Order if the Landlord
can be assured that either the rent owing
will be paid in full in roughly
one month’s time or
the tenancy will be terminated. The Landlord’s representative requested
that, should I decide to allow the motion to set aside the Order, that I
replace the underlying consent order with an new voidable eviction order
pursuant to subsection 78(12) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (
the ‘Act’). If the Tenant is able to
pay off all the rent owing, as he claims he can the tenancy will continue and,
if he cannot, the Landlord may pursue enforcement of the termination of the
tenancy with the Sheriff.
 
8.      
I have determined
that this is a sensible
approach which will not be unfair.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order SWL-55141-21, issued on October
14, 2021, is set aside.
 
2.    
Order SWL-48971-21, issued on July 15, 2021 is cancelled
and replaced with the
following paragraphs 3 through 10.
 
3.    
Unless the Tenant voids this order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated as of
January 31, 2022. The Tenant
must move out of the rental unit on or before January 31,
2022.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $1,864.38*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to
December 31, 2021 less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
5.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$37.15 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 1, 2022 to the date he moves out of the unit.
 
6.    
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
January 31, 2022 the Tenant will
start to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from February 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
7.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022, then starting
February 1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.




 
 
 
8.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 1, 2022.
 
9.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant
must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
 
(i)                
$3,188.00 if the payment
is made on or before
December 31 2021; and
(ii)               
$4,318.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022.
 
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph
and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
10.  The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if the pays the amount
required under that subsection on or after January 31, 2022 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to
make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
