In the matter
of:


2709, 565 SHERBOURNE STREET TORONTO ON M4X1W7


 




Between:


Medallion Corporation


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Isaac Bon Hillier Maritza Ortiz


Tenants



 
Medallion Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Maritza Ortiz (MO) and Isaac Bon Hillier (IBH) (the 'Tenants') The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after
the termination date.
This application
was heard via video/teleconference on October 12, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative Mark Melchers attended
the hearing.
As of 3:40 p.m., the Tenants
were not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     On May 4, 2021 the Landlord filed the application to end the tenancy and evict the Tenants based on two (N5 form) notices
for termination given to the Tenants.
 
2.     The first N5 notice was given to the Tenant on
December 11, 2020, alleging the behaviour and conduct
of the Tenant (IBH) has substantial interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment of other Tenants and the lawful right, privilege and interests of the
Landlord.
 
3.     Subsection 64(1) of the Act states: A landlord may
give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy if the conduct
of the tenant(s), another occupant
of the rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the
tenant(s) is such that it substantially
interferes with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex for all
usual purposes by another tenant or substantially interferes with another
lawful right, privilege or interest of the landlord or another tenant.
 
4.     The notice alleged that the Tenant (IBH) does not wear
a face mask in the residential complex or follow other COVID pandemic
recommendations as required by the City of Toronto Health Authority guidelines, and was verbally
abusive to the Landlord’s
property administrative employees, as well as verbally confronting other
tenants if they are wearing a mask or are vaccinated.




 
5.    
Section 64(3) of the
Residential Tenancies Act 2006, (the
‘Act’) provides that the type of N5 Notice served by the Landlord is
void if the Tenant(s), within seven (7) days after receiving the notice stops
the activity or corrects the conduct/behaviour. In this case, the
N5 was served on December 11, 2020, which means the seven (7) day voiding
period ran from December 12, 2020 to December 18, 2020.
 
6.    
The Landlord provided no documentary evidence that the Tenant(s) abusive
behaviour or conduct continued
during the voiding period, therefore, I must find the Tenant(s) voided the
first N5 notice.
 
7.     Pursuant to section 68 of the Act, before serving a
second N5 notice of termination the Landlord must have previously been given a
valid first notice of termination with an opportunity to void the notice
within 7 days of it being given. It is only if this first notice is given and the conduct
resumes or a situation
arises that constitutes grounds for a notice
of termination within six months after the first notice was given that a
non-voidable N5 notice can be served.
 
8.     A second (N5) notice was given to the Tenants on April
30, 2021 for further abusive behaviour complaints that the Landlord received
from other tenants in the residential complex regarding the Tenant (IBH)
ongoing preaching to them about his own opinion about vaccinations. The Tenant
(IBH) continued to speak inappropriately to other tenants regarding their personal beliefs
of the COVID pandemic.
 
9.     While the Tenant (IBH) may be medically exempt from
wearing a face mask, he continues to be required by municipal and provincial health
regulations to respect
and follow other guidelines such as social distancing while in the
common areas of the residential complex.
 
10.  The Tenants did not attend
the hearing to make submissions.
 
11.  Based on the Landlord’s uncontested testimony, I find
the Tenant(s) have substantially interfered
with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex
for all usual purposes by
another tenant or substantially interferes with another lawful right, privilege
or interest of the landlord or other tenants that reside in the residential
complex.
 
12.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenant(s) were provided
an opportunity to retain their tenancy by refraining from having unwanted
conversations with other tenants regarding the COVID 19 pandemic and their
personal choice on vaccinations and masks, to no avail.
 
13.  The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,380.34
from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
1, 2021.
 
14.  The order contains
all the reasons for the decision within
the order. No other reasons
will be issued.




 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated effective
February 20, 2022. The
Tenant(s) must moved out of the rental unit on or before February 20, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$10,681.82, which represents compensation for the
use of the unit from May 18, 2021 to February 9, 2022, less the rent deposit
and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $45.01 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from February 10, 2022 to
the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing on or before February 20, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 21,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 20, 2022, then starting
February 21, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 21, 2022.
