1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice

in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following condition
specified in the order: The Tenant failed to pay $972.00 towards
the arrears, on or before October 29, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 18, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January
