Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-95811-18










 

P.C
and S.C (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict S.J (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes. The Landlords also claimed administration charges related to NSF
cheques. (L1 application)
 
The
Landlords also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the
Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with
the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlords or another tenant. The Landlords also claimed compensation for each
day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date as well as
administration charges related to NSF cheques. (L2 application)
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on July 19, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord, P.C and the Landlords’ legal representative D.C
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
            L1 application
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from February 1, 2018 to July 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective May 16, 2018.
2.      The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
3.      The monthly rent as of the date of the hearing is $700.00.
4.      The
Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
5.      The
Landlords are entitled to $120.00 to reimburse them for charges they incurred
as a result of 6 cheques tendered by or on behalf of the Tenant which were
returned NSF.
6.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
            L2
application
7.      At
the hearing the Landlord’s legal representative submitted a copy of the lease
showing that the Tenant is required to pay 50% of utility costs. The Landlord
testified that the Tenant has not paid his share of the costs of
hydroelectricity and that the Tenant currently owes $521.66 to the Landlord for
hydroelectricity costs. 
8.      The
Landlord’s legal representative requested a conditional order requiring the
Tenant to pay the amount he owes for hydroelectricity.
9.     
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance
with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject
to the conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and
204(1) of the Act. 
 
It is ordered that:
 
            L1 application – non-payment of rent
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the rent arrears portion of this order as set out below, the
tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before August 5, 2018.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $4,198.92*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to July 25, 2018 and the total charges related
to 6 NSF cheques tendered
to the Landlords by or on behalf of the Tenant.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $23.01 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting July 26, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before
August 5, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from August 6, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before August 5, 2018, then starting August 6,
2018, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after August 6,
2018.
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void the rent arrears portion of this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlords or to the Board in trust:
i)        $4,510.00 if the payment is made on or before July 31, 2018, or
ii)       $5,210.00 if the payment is made on or before August 5, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside the rent arrears portion of this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after August 6, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is only entitled to make this
motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
            L2
application – non-payment of utilities
10.   The
Tenant shall pay the Landlord $521.66, which represents the total amount of hydroelectricity
costs owing, on or before August 5, 2018.
11.   If
the Tenant fails to make the payment in paragraph 10, above, the Landlord may
apply under section 78 of the Act, within 30 days of the breach and without
notice to the Tenant, for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenant.
