Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-15843-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


111 ALBERT STREET
S LINDSAY ON K9V6G1


 




Between:


2681877 Ontario Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Erika Grieves Heinz William Boyd


Tenants



 
 
 
2681877 Ontario Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Erika Grieves and Heinz William Boyd (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 20, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Curtis Begg, attended the hearing. As of 3:10 p.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from January
1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective March 15, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,800.00.
 
4.    
The Tenants
have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord sent letters to the Tenants on the
necessity of a repayment agreement. The Landlord’s
attempts at negotiating a repayment agreement were unsuccessful.
 
6.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
7.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenants, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant
to subsection




 
83(1) of the
Act. The amount outstanding is
substantial, and the Tenants have not paid any rent since the application was
filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental
unit on or before January 18, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $22,123.31*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 7, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $59.18 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 8, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 18, 2022, the
Tenants will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January 19, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord, on or after January 19, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 18, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $23,586.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenants
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after
January 19, 2022 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
