Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-90971-18
 











 
 
 

D. R. N. P. H. C. (the 'Landlord') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict C. C., R. C. and A. C. (the 'Tenants')
because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Whitby on June 18, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord’s
representative, A. H., attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent they were required to pay for the period from April 1, 2018 to
June 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective April 29, 2018.
2.    
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,126.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
3.    
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from May 1, 2017 to April 29, 2018.
4.    
The Tenants paid $2,406.00
after the application was filed.
5.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before July 7,
2018.
2.    
As of the date of this
order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the Landlord is
entitled to by $351.61*.
3.    
However, the Landlord is
authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the Landlord owes
the Tenants:
•       
$37.02 per day for
compensation for the use of the unit starting June 27, 2018 to the date the
Tenants move out of the unit, and
•       
$175.00 for the cost of
filing the application.
4.    
The Landlord or the Tenants
shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before July 7, 2018, then starting July 8, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
6.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 8, 2018.
7.    
If the Tenants wish to void
this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust:
i)       $1,126.65 if the payment is made on or before June 30, 2018, or
ii)      $2,252.65 if the payment is made on or before July 7, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.    
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after July 8, 2018
but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
