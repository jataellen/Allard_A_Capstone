Jacob Sawyer


Tenant



 
 
 
London
Property Corp (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Jacob Sawyer (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes; because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit
or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or
negligently caused undue damage to the premises; and because the Tenant,
another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the
residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit
after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 4, 2021.
Only the Landlord Representative M. Sawicki attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
L1 Application
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
November 1, 2020 to April 1, 2021.
 
2.     The monthly rent is $575.00.
 
3.     Because of the arrears, the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination effective April 1, 2021. The
Tenant vacated the property on June 17, 2021.
 
4.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $575.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period
from September 1, 2020 to April 1, 2021.




 
L2 Application
 
5.     The Tenant was still in possession of the rental
unit as of the date the application was filed, however the Tenant has since vacated the rental unit.
 
6.    
The Landlord’s application seeks
$1,750.00 in damages from the Tenant. Section 89 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the “Act”) allows a
landlord to apply to the Board for an
order requiring a tenant to pay reasonable costs that the landlord has incurred
or will incur for the repair of, or where repairing is not reasonable, the
replacement of damaged property, if
the tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person whom the tenant permits in the residential complex wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to the rental unit or the residential complex and the
tenant is in possession of the rental unit.
 
7.    
To succeed in its application, the
Landlord must show that the damage is “undue”, meaning it is beyond normal wear
and tear, and considered to be excessive or unnecessary.
 
8.    
The Landlord conducted a post
move-out inspection on June 17, 2021 and produced a video recording of the
inspection.
 
Closet & Bedroom Door & Drywall
 
9.    
The Landlord submitted that there
is a missing closet door in the bedroom; damage to a neighbouring bedroom door;
and, damage to the drywall requiring repairs. The Landlord sought $250, $300,
and $100, respectively.
 
10.  The Landlord’s videorecording from June 17, 2021
confirmed there is a closet door in the bedroom missing and that there is a hole
in the drywall requiring repairs. The damage to the drywall was caused by what
appears to be an intentional and
deliberate application of force by way of punch/kick within an area that the
Tenant had exclusive possession. I find,
on a balance of probabilities, that the damage was caused by the Tenant, is
beyond simple wear and tear and that the cost incurred by the landlord in the
circumstances is reasonable.
 
11.  The Landlord produced an email from another residence
which stipulates that the Tenant “kicked down” his bedroom door.  While the Board may admit hearsay, it
must be mindful of the inherent dangers in doing so, particularly given that
hearsay evidence can be extremely unreliable. In this case, I have decided to
admit the Landlord’s hearsay evidence since the email appears to have been
written shortly after the incident in question, the Landlord has already
undertaken the work and has produced a supporting invoice. I find, on a balance of probabilities,
that the damage to the bedroom door was caused by the Tenant, that it is
willful and that the cost requested by the landlord in the circumstances is
reasonable.




 
Carpet & Smoke remediation
 
12.  The Landlord also seeks $600 for the
replacement of the bedroom carpet and relies
upon the videorecording from June 17, 2021. While the carpet does contain some evidence of staining, any damage to the carpet
appears to be the
result of normal wear and tear. This claim for damage is denied.
 
13.  Similarly, the Landlord seeks damages for smoke
remediation/painting. While the
Landlord did tender invoices in support of this claim for damages, I am not
satisfied based upon the
videorecording that there was “undue” damage based upon the video evidence
produced. Further, since there were other tenants living in the rental
complex, I am not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the need for
this repair work was caused by the Tenant. This
portion of the Landlord’s claim is also denied.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated on June 17, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$3,773.86*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to June 17, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $650.00,
which represents the reasonable costs of
repairing the damage and/or replacing the damaged property.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     The total amount
that the Tenant shall pay to the Landlord is $4,624.86.
 
6.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before
February 18, 2022, the Tenant will
start to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from February 18, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
