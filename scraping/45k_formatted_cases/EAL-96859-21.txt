Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006


 




 


File Number: EAL-96859-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
208 OAK CRESCENT RENFREW ON K7V3Y7


 




Between:


Renfrew County Housing
Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jamie
  Smith


Tenant



 
 
 
Renfrew County
Housing Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Jamie Smith (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant or another
occupant of the rental unit has committed an illegal act or has carried out, or permitted
someone to carry out an illegal trade, business or occupation
in the rental unit or the residential complex.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 17, 2021.
 
Only the
Landlord’s Agent, Andrea Blackburn, attended the hearing. As of 1:12 p.m., the
Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board. Daniel McPeak (‘DM’) attended as a witness for the Landlord.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant
has committed an illegal act in the rental unit.
 
2.    
On July 27, 2021, the Tenant
was charged with criminal offences
of mischief and breach
of conditions. The Tenant was charged because she left her music “thumping” to a point
where it was causing a disturbance to the other tenants in the residential
complex. The issue with the Tenant playing loud music has been an ongoing
problem that has prompted other tenants to complain to the Landlord.
 
3.    
DM lives beside the Tenant’s unit.
She testified that the Tenant plays loud music from 8
a.m. to 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. daily.
DM suffers from depression and she has been hospitalized as a result of the Tenant’s
behaviour.
 
4.    
The Divisional Court in
Swansea Village Co-op v. Balcerzak, 1988 CanLII 4844 (ON SC), [1998] 63 O.R. (2d) 741 (‘Swansea’)
held that eviction for illegal act does not apply to trivial offences. It is
necessary that the offence has the potential to affect the character of the
premises or disturb the reasonable enjoyment of the landlord or other tenants.
In this case, I find that




File Number: EAL-96859-21
 
the Tenant’s
conduct resulted in disturbance to the other
tenants’ reasonable enjoyment. Accordingly, the tenancy is
terminated.
 
5.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated, as of January 22, 2022. The Tenant
must move out of the rental unit on or before January 22, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before January
22, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 23, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January
22, 2022, then starting January
23, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
5.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 23, 2022.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on July 23, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction
where the rental unit is located.
