Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12802-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


UPPER, 1039
WINDSOR AVENUE WINDSOR ON
  N9N1K3


 




Between:


Tamerlan Imanov


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Dwayne Howell


Tenant



 
Tamerlan Imanov (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dwayne Howell (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant entered into an agreement to terminate the tenancy. (L3 application)
 
This L3 application was sent by a Duty Member
to a Board hearing, which was held by
videoconference on February 16, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord and the
Landlord’s Legal Representative, Richard Lammers, attended the hearing. As of 9:35 am when the hearing commenced,
the Tenant was not present or represented even though the Board’s
Notice of Hearing
had been sent to the Tenant. The Tenant
did not appear in the videoconference room for the balance of the hearing
block.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The L3 application was filed on December 6, 2021.
 
2.     The Landlord testified
about his purchase
of the rental unit which closed on October 15, 2021, and that the tenancy with the
Tenant had already been in existence when he became the new landlord. The
Landlord testified that he simply inherited the existing tenancy with the
Tenant.
 
3.     The Landlord also explained how he and the Tenant then entered
into a private “cash for keys” agreement that had been signed
by the parties on October 24, 2021, but that the private agreement did not
create any new tenancy.
 
4.     Subsequently, the Landlord testified that he and the
Tenant signed an agreement to terminate the tenancy
on November 15, 2021 (the “N11 agreement”), but he had to file the L3 application because the Tenant
did not move out. The Landlord referred
to the attached N11 agreement and his declaration, which both support the L3
application.
 
5.     I asked the Landlord to submit any circumstances he is aware of respecting the Tenant or himself that would need to be
considered.

6.    
Based on the Landlord’s submissions, I find that the Landlord and the Tenant signed and entered into an agreement to terminate
the tenancy as of November 15, 2021, but that the Tenant has not moved out of
the rental unit by the termination date.
 
7.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before March 8, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall
pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing on or before March 8, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 9, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 8, 2022, then starting
March 9, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
5.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 9, 2022.

The tenant has until March 7, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 77(6) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by March 7, 2022 the order
will be stayed and the Board will schedule a hearing.
 
If you have any questions about
this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.
 
In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on September 9, 2022
if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental
unit is located.
