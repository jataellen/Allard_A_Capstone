Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44680-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


207, 1950 LASALLE BLVD SUDBURY ON P3A2G5


 




Between:


Greater Sudbury Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jessie Duguay-Bruyere


Tenant



 
 
 
Greater Sudbury Housing
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Jessie Duguay-Bruyere (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant
pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified
in the mediated settlement issued by
the Board on November 3, 2020
with respect to application NOL-38936-19.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The mediated settlement provided that the Landlord
could apply to the Board under section 78 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act') without
notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet
certain condition(s) specified in the settlement.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant
has not met the following conditions specified in the settlement: The Tenant failed to pay $100.00 towards the arrears, on or
before December 21, 2021. The Tenant failed to pay the lawful
monthly rent in full, on or before January 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting mediated settlement required
the Tenant to pay rent or
some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request
an order for the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The amount that is still owing, according to the terms
of the mediated settlement, for arrears of rent, and the costs related to the application fee for the previous application is
$3,906.00.
 
5.     Since the date of the mediated settlement, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that
became owing for the period from June 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:




File Number: NOL-44680-22
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 31, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$4,520.34*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 20, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application.
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $16.77 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 21, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
31, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 31, 2022, then starting
February 1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 1, 2022.

The tenant has until January 30, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 30, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
