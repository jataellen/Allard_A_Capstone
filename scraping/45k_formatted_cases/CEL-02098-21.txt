Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-02098-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


48 BROADFOOT ROAD BARRIE ON L4N5K7


 




Between:


Coral Hills Housing
Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Dennis
Simmons


Tenant



 
 
 
Coral Hills
Housing Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Dennis Simmons (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes and because the Tenant has been
persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination
date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 4, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s Representative D. Ciobotaru and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
N4/L1 Application
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
June 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 24,
2021.
 
2.    
The monthly
rent is $1456.00.
 
3.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,456.00
from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenant.
 
4.    
Since the application was filed, the Tenant has made a total of $1948.00 in rent
payments.
 
5.    
Section 83 requires that I consider
all the circumstances, including the Tenant’s
and the Landlord’s situations to determine if it would be appropriate to grant section 83 relief
from eviction. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The




File Number: CEL-02098-21
 
Tenant did
attend the hearing, and indicated he intends to move out and asked until the
end of the month to locate another premise.
 
N8/L2 Application
 
6.    
I find the Tenant
has persistently failed
to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
7.    
The Landlord’s
application was filed in July 2021. For
9 out of the 10 months leading up to the filing of the Landlords’ application,
rent has been paid late or not
paid in full in each of those
months. This is the first N8 filed.
In the event the Tenant is able to pay all rent arears owing and void the N4/L1
order set out below, I will grant conditional relief in respect of the
Landlord’s L2 application.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
N4/L1 Application
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 21, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $4,837.55*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
10, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $47.87
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 11, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
21, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 22, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 21, 2022, then starting January
22, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 22, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 21, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $5,453.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be
terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.




File Number: CEL-02098-21
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after
January 22, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
N8/L2 Application
 
1.    In the event the Tenant
voids the order as set out above, the Tenant shall pay rent to the Landlord for
the months of February 2022 through to July 2022, on or before the 1st day of each and every month.
 
2.    If the Tenant fails to
make any payment in accordance with paragraph 1 of this portion of the order,
the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to the Board pursuant to
section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenant. The Landlord must make this application no later than 30 days after the
Tenant’s breach of paragraph 1 of this order.
