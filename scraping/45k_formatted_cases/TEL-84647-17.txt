Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006

Q. A. (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict S. K. M. and S. P. (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in
Toronto on November 8, 2017.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s
representative D. S. and the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants moved into the
home on April 24, 2017 and have use of the entire home.
2.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent they were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2017 to May
31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective September 25, 2017.
3.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $2,500.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
4.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from April 21, 2017 to September 25,
2017.
5.     
At the hearing the Tenants raised
a number of issues pursuant to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act').
6.     
The first issue dealt with
what appears to be uncovered electrical or telephone connections. 
7.     
These items should not have
been left in the condition that they are and I have awarded a 1% rental
abatement for the maximum allowed by the Residential Tenancies Act which
is one year. This then is 12 x 1% x $2500 = $300.00 and the covers will be
ordered installed.
8.     
The next item was painting
of the home.
9.     
The Tenants insist that they
were promised that the unit would be painted however there is no evidence of
this and nothing that would indicate that the current painted condition would
not be acceptable under the Residential Tenancies Act.
10.  
No award.
11.  
The Tenants believed that
there was to be a fence built in the rear yard but there is no evidence of any
such agreement being in place, it is not mentioned in the lease agreement and
would not be orderable under the Residential Tenancies Act.
12.  
No award.
13.  
The next item was with mold
in the home.
14.  
While the Tenants eventually
found out that there was no safety issue over any mold in the home, it was
noted that there were two separate areas of concern.
15.  
The first was in the
bathroom which has been dealt with.
16.  
The other was a wall problem
in the garage that remains.
17.  
I have awarded a flat
$100.00 for not having dealt with this matter even though it is superficial, it
is still a blight on the home and I will also order that it now be repaired.
18.  
The next issue dealt with
furniture that was left in the basement.
19.  
In this case the Landlord
seemed to believe that it was acceptable to use the space that they were
charging the Tenants for and that there was some type of agreement between the
parties over its use.
20.  
The furniture was removed in
January of 2018.
21.  
I find nothing that would
allow the furniture to remain in place in the lease agreement and the Tenants
deny that there was any such agreement.
22.  
I have awarded 8 months of
rental abatement of 5% per month to allow for the reduction in usage of the
home. Plain and simply once the lease was signed all the Landlords possessions
should have been removed from the rental unit.
23.  
This then is 8 x 5% x $2500
= $1,000.00.
24.  
The next issue was over the
condition of the steps in the garage.
25.  
As there is no evidence that
the Landlord was ever made aware of any problem with them I will make no award
on this matter however I will note that they will be inspected to make sure
that they are safe.
26.  
The final matter was what
the Tenants called harassment over the entire tenancy.
27.  
There were a number of
emails between the parties that are quite threatening on the Landlords behalf
as admitted to at the hearing.
28.  
For the Landlord this is a
business and should be run as such with little emotion coming into dealings
with what are in essence customers.
29.  
I also note that mail
continues to be delivered to the rental unit for the Landlord and that her
father often pops by to pick up the mail.
30.  
This must stop.
31.  
The Landlord has the right
to visit the property but it must be done as per the Residential Tenancies
Act.
32.  
The use of the property is
assigned to the Tenants. There is nothing in the lease that allows for the
Landlord to make their own use of this property outside of what is allowed
under the Act.
33.  
For this I have awarded a 3%
rental abatement for the entire maximum of 12 months for a cost of 3% x 12 x
$2500 = $900.00.
34.  
The Tenants are entitled to
an abatement of rent of $2,300.00
which will be subtracted
from the amount owed in arrears.
35.  
The Tenants have paid
$15,000.00 to the Board in trust since the application was filed. **.
36.  
This money will be released
to the Landlord.
37.  
Both parties agreed at the
hearing that after the 6 months of arrears held by the board are returned to
the Landlord there remains outstanding 4 months of rent at $2,500.00 per month
or $10,000.00 total plus the $190.00 application filing fee. 
38.  
This amount once the
abatement of rent of $2,300 is withdrawn leaves an outstanding balance of
$7,890.00.
39.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. 
40.   The Reasons contained in this order constitute
all of the reasons used in making my decision.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $7,890.00 for arrears of rent up to and including May 31, 2018
(including paragraph #4) and the Landlord’s cost of filing the application. 
2.     
The Tenants will make the
following payments to the Landlord in full and on time:
•

before June 1, 2018                           June rent

•       
$1,972.50           On or
before September 15, 2018             Balance of Arrears
3.     
If the Tenants fail to make
any one of the payments in accordance with this order, the outstanding balance
of any arrears of rent and costs to be paid by the Tenants to the Landlord
pursuant to paragraph 1 of this order shall become immediately due and owing
and the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenants, apply to the Board
pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and
evicting the Tenants and requiring that the Tenants pay any new arrears, NSF
fees and related charges that became owing after May 31, 2018. This application
must be made within 30 days of the missed payment. 
4.     
The Board shall pay to the
Landlord the amount of $15,000.00 together with any accrued interest. 
 
5.     
The Landlord will complete
the following tasks by no later than May 31, 2018:
•

boxes

Deal with the mold in the
wall in the garage
•       
Make sure that there is no
further mail coming to the house for the Landlords

Ensure that the garage steps
are indeed safe
 
6.     
The Landlord will ensure
that all future visits to the site are in full accordance with the Residential
Tenancies Act immediately.
