1703, 2777 KIPLING AVENUE TORONTO ON M9V4M2


 




Between:


Q Res

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Petrona Mayers
  Sesilia Kauma


Tenants



 
 
 
Q Res V Operating LP (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sesilia Kauma and Petrona
Mayers (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 17, 2022. The
Landlord's Legal Representative, Bryan Rubin,
attended the hearing.
The Tenant, Sesilia
Kauma, signed in for the
hearing but was not present or represented at the hearing when the application
was called at 11:49 a.m; the hearing proceeded uncontested in her absence.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the
period from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective September 22, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are
in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,648.60 as of January
1, 2022.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,629.06 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit has been paid to
the Tenants for the
period from March 1,
2020 to February 28, 2021.
 
6.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord
attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the




 
Tenants, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 7, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$7,979.65*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 27, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $54.20 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 28, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing*
on or before February 7, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 8,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 7, 2022, then starting
February 8, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 8, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)     $9,979.90 if the payment is made on or before
January 31, 2022,
or
ii)     $11,628.50 if the payment is made on or before
February 7, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not
make full payment in
accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 8, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
