Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12296-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


UNIT 5, 8278 HIGHWAY
11 S SEVERN ON L3V0Z3


 




Between:


Mohammad Rostami


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Chris Poole


Tenant



 
 
 
Mohammad Rostami (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Chris Poole (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in
the residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage; and because the Tenant,
another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the
residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 956 0593 7653# on January
18, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s representative Shahab Goneh-Farahani attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s representative
confirmed the contents of the N5 notice served on the Tenant. The unit is in a state of disrepair. The walls are covered with mould due to water in the unit. There is rotting food and the floors are covered with beer cans
and garbage. The Landlord’s representative could not enter the unit through the
front door due to the condition of the
unit and was forced to enter through
the back door. A plumber was hired to
look into plumbing issues and informed the Landlord the problem is to the
extent that he believes the walls will need to be stripped to the studs to
resolve the problem.
 
2.     Neighbouring tenants are complaining about the strong
smell coming from the Tenant’s unit.
 
3.     The Tenant’s refrigerator was leaking water. The Tenant complained to the Landlord. The
Landlord purchased a new refrigerator. The
Tenant refuses to take the new refrigerator
inside and the old refrigerator continues to leak in the unit. The water leak is
now getting into a neighbouring unit.




 
4.    
I
find the Tenant
has wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the rental
unit and the residential
complex.
 
5.     The Landlord will incur costs
of $3,500.00 to repair the damage.
 
6.     This conduct has substantially interfered with the
Landlord's and the other tenants' reasonable
enjoyment of the residential complex
and substantially interferes with a lawful right, privilege or interest of
the Landlord.
 
7.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of February
1, 2022. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 1, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$3,500.00, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
February 1, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 2, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 1, 2022, then starting
February 2, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 2, 2022.
