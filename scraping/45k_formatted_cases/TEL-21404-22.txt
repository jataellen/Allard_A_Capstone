Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-21404-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


12, 4 FRONT
STREET EAST BOBCAYGEON ON K0M1A0


 




Between:


John Vanderheide


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Matt Gallie


Tenant



 
 
 
On January 27, 2022, John
Vanderheide (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Matt Gallie (the 'Tenant') and for
an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the
Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the
Board on July 14, 2021 with respect to application TEL-15005-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application alleges that the Tenant has failed to pay rent and arrears since October 2021.
 
2.     An L4 application is an application made under section
78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006. Such an application may be brought
if a previous order imposed
conditions on a tenant, and
contained an express provision authorizing a landlord to make such an
application in the event a tenant fails to comply with such conditions.
 
3.    
Under subsection 78(5), an application under
section 78 may be brought
no later than 30
days after the breach of such a term in a previous order.
 
4.     While the previous
order, which was given on consent, includes
a repayment plan and an express provision authorizing a
landlord to make an application under section 78 in the event a tenant fails to
comply with such conditions, the repayment schedule does not include any
payment due in the 30 days preceding the date of the Landlord’s application.
Specifically, the repayment schedule requires the Tenant make payments on the
first of every month from August 1, 2021 to December 1, 2022 inclusive, with
the exception of January 1, 2022. There
is no separate provision in the previous order that the Tenant pay all rent in
full and on time.
 
5.     There being no breach within the 30 days preceding the Landlord’s application, the application must be dismissed for being statute-barred. This dismissal is without

prejudice to the Landlord’s ability to bring a future application within 30 days of any subsequent breaches of the terms of
the previous order.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
 
2.     Order TEL-15005-21 remains
in effect.
