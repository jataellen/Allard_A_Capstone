Tenants



 
 
 
Natalia Kortchevnaia and Alexei
Kortchevnyi (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Josee Miller and Anthony Thomas
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 18, 2022. Only
the Landlords attended the hearing.
As of 10:22 a.m., the Tenants were not present
or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
The only part of the application that proceeded was the claim for rent arrears. As a result,
the order will be limited to rent arrears and costs only, not eviction.
 
Determinations:
 
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period
from September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.
 
The Tenants
were in possession of the rental
unit on the date the application was filed.
The lawful monthly rent is $2,000.00.
The Landlord
is not holding a last month's rent deposit.
 
The Tenants have made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlords $10,000.00, which represents the amount of rent
owing up to January 31, 2022.




File Number: EAL-98104-21
 
2.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlords the full amount owing on or before
February 13, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 14, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
