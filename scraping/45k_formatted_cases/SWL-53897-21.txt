Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-53897-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


MAIN FLOOR,
775 HALL AVENUE WINDSOR ON N9A2L9


 




Between:


Marda Management Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Seif Alssadi


Tenant



 
 
 
Marda Management Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Seif Alssadi (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 3, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s Legal Representative, Kira Passell, and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period
from May 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective July 26,
2021.
 
2.    
The rental arrears outstanding to February 28, 2022 total
$6,300.00.
 
3.     The Tenant has not paid any rent since the application was
filed.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.    
At the hearing, the Tenant did admit to still owing the outstanding rent to the Landlord and that due to his unfortunate situation
he could not pay the current rent as well as pay back the outstanding rental
arrears.
 
6.     Both parties agreed
that the tenancy
was no longer sustainable and that the tenancy
should end by February 28, 2022.




 
7.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
8.     This order contains
all of the reasons in this matter
and no further reasons will be given.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 28, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$5,877.35*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 10, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $23.01
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 11, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 28, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
