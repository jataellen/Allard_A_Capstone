In the matter
of:


BASEMENT, 92 GLENDALE AVENUE TORONTO ON M6R2T2


 




Between:


Jogindro Mand


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Cicily
R. Douglass


Tenant



 
 
 
Jogindro Mand (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Cicily R. Douglass (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021. The Landlord, the Landlord's Legal
Representative, Howard Levenson, and the Tenant attended the hearing. The Tenant spoke with Duty Counsel prior
to the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective August
27, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant
was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,034.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $975.45 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
 
5.    
The Tenant
paid $1,034.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.    
The parties agree that
the amount outstanding to December 31, 2021, inclusive of rent arrears
($5,170.00) and costs ($186.00), is $5,356.00.




 
Relief sought
 
7.    
The Landlord sought a
termination of the tenancy due to these arrears. The Landlord testified that
the Landlord did not have any negotiations with the Tenants about the
possibility of a payment plan to resolve
the application. The Landlord further
testified that he had sent
the Tenant text messages reminded her that rent was due.
 
8.    
On her part, the Tenant
sought to preserve the tenancy by way of a payment plan to resolve the arrears.
The Tenant proposed to pay the arrears in full by way of a twelve- month payment
plan. The Tenant
testified that she had been suffering with mental health issues due to Covid 19 and that her mother,
partner and nephew recently passed away. She did not dispute
the amount of arrears owed and had made a payment of $1,034.00 before the
hearing.
 
9.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 ofthe Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic upon the parties and whether the Landlord has attempted to negotiate a
payment plan, and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from
eviction subject to the conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a)
and 204(1) of the Act.
 
10.  The Tenant’s proposal
to pay the arrears in full within
a period of twelve months is realistic in light of her limited income.
I also find that the
Landlord’s failure to attempt
to negotiate an agreement with
the Tenants in this instance weigh in favour of granting relief from eviction.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,356.00, which represents the arrears of rent
($5,170.00) and costs ($186.00) outstanding for the period ending December 31,
2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay the Landlord
the lawful rent for January
2022 in full, on or before
January 1, 2022.
